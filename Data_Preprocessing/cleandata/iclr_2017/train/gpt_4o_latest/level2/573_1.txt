The paper presents a novel framework for training and evaluating artificial agents in tasks that require efficient information-seeking behavior. The authors propose a collection of tasks where agents must iteratively search partially observed environments for fragments of information to achieve specific goals. By combining deep learning architectures with reinforcement learning techniques, the paper demonstrates that agents can learn to actively reduce uncertainty and exploit acquired information. The authors highlight three main contributions: (1) a shift in perspective from passive attention to active information-seeking, (2) the development of agents capable of balancing exploration and exploitation, and (3) the use of task-agnostic heuristics to improve task-specific performance.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the paper's strong empirical results and its significant contribution to the field of reinforcement learning and information-seeking agents. The proposed framework is well-motivated, novel, and demonstrates practical utility across diverse tasks, including image classification, positional reasoning, and language-based games like Hangman. The experiments are rigorous, and the results convincingly support the claims made by the authors.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical gap in reinforcement learning by focusing on active information-seeking rather than passive observation. The proposed tasks and framework are innovative and well-placed within the literature, building on prior work in attention mechanisms and intrinsic motivation.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments span a range of tasks, from synthetic datasets (Cluttered MNIST, BlockWorld) to real-world datasets (CelebA) and language-based tasks (Hangman). The results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline methods.
3. Technical Rigor: The paper provides a clear mathematical formulation of the problem, detailed descriptions of the model architectures, and a robust training methodology using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and TD(Î»). The inclusion of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards is well-justified and enhances the agent's performance.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections, such as the mathematical formulation and training details, could benefit from additional simplification or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Comparison with Baselines: The paper acknowledges that prior models like RAM and DRAW were not optimized for information efficiency, which biases comparisons. Including additional baselines or ablation studies would strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Limitations and Future Work: The paper could more explicitly discuss limitations, such as the reliance on simplifying assumptions (e.g., static environments, perfect memory) and the scalability of the approach to more complex, real-world settings.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed framework generalize to dynamic environments where the answers to questions may change over time?
2. Can the model handle scenarios where memory is imperfect or noisy, and if not, how might this limitation be addressed?
3. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of intrinsic reward functions? Would alternative formulations lead to significantly different results?
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field and is likely to inspire further research on active information-seeking in artificial agents. With minor revisions to improve clarity and address limitations, it is a strong candidate for acceptance.
