Review of the Paper: "Unsupervised Third-Person Imitation Learning"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach to third-person imitation learning, where an agent learns to replicate a task demonstrated by an expert from a different viewpoint, without requiring correspondence between teacher and student states. The authors leverage domain confusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to extract domain-agnostic features and train a policy that mimics expert behavior. The proposed method is validated through experiments in three simulated environments (Pointmass, Reacher, and Inverted Pendulum), demonstrating its ability to learn domain-invariant representations and achieve competitive performance compared to first-person imitation learning. The paper also explores the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters, camera angles, and multi-time step inputs, providing a comprehensive evaluation.
Decision: Accept
The paper addresses an important and underexplored problem in reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL): enabling agents to learn from third-person demonstrations. The proposed approach is novel, well-motivated, and demonstrates promising results in a variety of tasks. The use of domain confusion to extract invariant features is particularly innovative and extends the applicability of GAN-based imitation learning to more realistic scenarios. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant enough to merit acceptance.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Relevance: The paper tackles a critical limitation of existing IL methods, which typically require first-person demonstrations. By enabling third-person imitation, the proposed method has the potential to significantly broaden the applicability of IL in real-world scenarios, such as robotics.
2. Technical Soundness: The integration of domain confusion and GANs is well-justified and effectively implemented. The use of multi-time step inputs to improve discrimination is a thoughtful addition that enhances the robustness of the approach.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough and address key questions about the method's performance, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and comparison with baselines. The results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of third-person imitation learning and highlight the importance of domain confusion.
4. Clarity and Completeness: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the problem, methodology, and experimental setup. The inclusion of learning curves, architecture details, and variance analyses in the appendices adds to its reproducibility.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability: While the method performs well in simple environments, its scalability to more complex tasks (e.g., high-dimensional state spaces or real-world robotics) is unclear. Future work could explore applications in more challenging domains.
2. Comparison with Additional Baselines: The paper could benefit from comparisons with other domain adaptation techniques or unsupervised feature learning methods to better contextualize its contributions.
3. Ablation Studies: While some ablations are presented (e.g., domain confusion and multi-time step inputs), a more detailed analysis of the feature extractor and discriminator architectures would provide additional insights into the method's performance.
4. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the approach, such as potential failure cases or computational overhead. Acknowledging these would strengthen the discussion.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method handle scenarios where the expert and novice domains differ significantly in terms of dynamics or task complexity?
2. Could the approach be extended to handle continuous third-person demonstrations (e.g., video streams) instead of discrete trajectories?
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the domain confusion coefficient (Î»), in more complex environments?
Conclusion
This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of imitation learning by addressing the challenging problem of third-person learning in an unsupervised setting. The proposed method is innovative, well-supported by experiments, and has the potential to inspire future research in this area. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its weaknesses, and it is a valuable addition to the conference.
