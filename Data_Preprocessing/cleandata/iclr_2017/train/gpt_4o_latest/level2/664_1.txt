Review
The paper proposes a novel application of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) for generating image containers that are more resistant to steganalysis, introducing the Steganographic Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) model. The authors claim that their approach can significantly reduce the detection accuracy of steganalysis methods, making it a promising tool for secure steganography. They provide experimental evidence supporting these claims, demonstrating that SGAN-generated containers can deceive steganalysis tools to a degree comparable to random classifiers. Additionally, they explore the impact of varying random seed values during container generation, showing that this further reduces detection accuracy.
Decision: Reject.  
While the paper introduces an interesting concept and demonstrates potential, it falls short in terms of novelty, experimental rigor, and clarity in presenting its contributions. Below, I outline the reasons for this decision and provide constructive feedback for improvement.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Placement in Literature:  
   The application of GANs to steganography is an intriguing idea, but the work primarily builds on existing DCGAN frameworks without introducing significant methodological innovations. The SGAN model is essentially a straightforward extension of DCGAN with an added steganalysis discriminator. While the concept of using GANs for steganography is novel, the paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from prior work on adversarial training or provide a compelling argument for why this approach is superior to existing methods.
2. Experimental Rigor:  
   The experiments, while extensive, lack depth in evaluation. For instance, the paper primarily focuses on the ±1-embedding algorithm, which is relatively simple compared to state-of-the-art steganographic techniques like WOW or S-UNIWARD. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not attempt to address it within the scope of the paper. Additionally, the results rely heavily on the CelebA dataset, which may not generalize well to other domains. The paper would benefit from testing on more diverse datasets and embedding algorithms.
3. Support for Claims:  
   While the experimental results show that SGAN-generated containers reduce steganalysis accuracy, the improvements over DCGAN are marginal. This raises questions about whether the added complexity of SGAN is justified. Furthermore, the paper does not provide sufficient analysis of why SGAN performs better or how its performance scales with different steganalysis models.
4. Clarity and Completeness:  
   The paper is dense and technical, making it difficult for readers to follow the key contributions and experimental setup. The mathematical formulations are thorough but not well-integrated into the narrative, which detracts from the accessibility of the work. Additionally, the lack of a detailed discussion on limitations and potential ethical concerns weakens the overall impact.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand the Scope of Experiments:  
   Test the SGAN model on more advanced steganographic algorithms (e.g., WOW, HUGO, S-UNIWARD) and diverse datasets to demonstrate its generalizability and robustness.
2. Provide a Deeper Analysis:  
   Include a more detailed discussion of why SGAN outperforms DCGAN and how the trade-off parameter α affects the results. Additionally, explore the impact of different architectural choices for the generator and discriminator networks.
3. Clarify Contributions:  
   Clearly articulate the novelty of the SGAN model compared to existing GAN-based approaches. Highlight specific innovations and their significance in the context of steganography.
4. Address Ethical Considerations:  
   Given the potential misuse of steganography for malicious purposes, the paper should include a discussion on ethical implications and safeguards.
5. Improve Presentation:  
   Simplify the narrative and focus on the key contributions. Use visual aids (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts) to explain the SGAN architecture and experimental setup more intuitively.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the SGAN model perform when tested on more advanced steganographic algorithms like WOW or S-UNIWARD?  
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-off parameter α and its impact on the realism and steganalysis resistance of generated containers?  
3. How does the SGAN model generalize to datasets beyond CelebA, particularly those with different image distributions?  
4. What are the computational costs of training SGAN compared to DCGAN, and are these costs justified by the observed performance gains?  
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting idea, it requires significant improvements in experimental rigor, clarity, and novelty to make a stronger case for acceptance. I encourage the authors to address these issues and resubmit.
