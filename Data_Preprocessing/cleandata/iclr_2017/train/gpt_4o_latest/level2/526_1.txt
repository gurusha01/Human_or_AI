Review of the Paper
This paper addresses a significant gap in the theoretical understanding of modern convolutional networks (convnets) by providing the first convergence guarantee applicable to nonsmooth, nonconvex architectures such as those incorporating rectifiers and max-pooling. The authors introduce the neural Taylor approximation and the associated Taylor loss as a novel analytical tool, leveraging concepts from online convex optimization to prove a convergence rate of \(1/\sqrt{N}\), which matches the lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The paper also explores the role of activation configurations in rectifier networks and empirically investigates the hypothesis that adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam outperform SGD by exploring the space of smooth regions more thoroughly.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the paper's theoretical novelty and its practical relevance. The convergence guarantee for modern convnets is a significant contribution to the field, bridging a critical gap in understanding the optimization dynamics of widely used architectures. Additionally, the empirical results provide strong evidence supporting the theoretical claims and offer valuable insights into the behavior of adaptive optimizers.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The introduction of the neural Taylor approximation and the Taylor loss is a substantial innovation. These tools not only enable the theoretical analysis but also provide a conceptual framework for understanding the challenges of optimizing nonsmooth, nonconvex functions. The convergence guarantee is a major theoretical advancement, as it applies to real-world convnets without requiring unrealistic assumptions.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive and well-executed, demonstrating that the theoretical bounds hold across various optimizers, tasks, and architectures. The analysis of regret scaling and the exploration of activation configurations provide compelling evidence for the paper's hypotheses.
3. Practical Relevance: The findings have immediate implications for the design and selection of optimizers in deep learning. The observation that adaptive optimizers explore activation configurations more effectively could inspire future work on improving optimization strategies for rectifier networks.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the theoretical contributions are significant, the paper's dense mathematical exposition may be challenging for a broader audience. Simplifying some of the explanations or providing more intuitive insights could enhance accessibility.
2. Limitations and Future Work: The paper acknowledges that the convergence guarantee is relative to the Taylor optimum and does not preclude convergence to poor local minima. It would be helpful to discuss this limitation in more detail and suggest potential avenues for addressing it.
3. Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff: The paper raises intriguing questions about the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in nonsmooth neural networks. A more detailed discussion or preliminary analysis of these tradeoffs could strengthen the paper's impact.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive are the empirical results to the choice of hyperparameters for the optimizers? Could this affect the generalizability of the findings?
2. The paper hypothesizes that adaptive optimizers explore activation configurations more effectively. Could this hypothesis be tested further by designing experiments that explicitly measure exploration in different regions of the parameter space?
3. The Taylor loss clamps activation configurations to smooth regions. Could this property be leveraged to design new optimizers that explicitly balance exploration and exploitation?
Overall, this paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the understanding of optimization in modern convnets. With minor improvements to clarity and additional discussion of limitations, it has the potential to significantly influence both research and practice in deep learning.
