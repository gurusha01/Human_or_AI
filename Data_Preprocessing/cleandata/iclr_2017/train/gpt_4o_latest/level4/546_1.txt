Thank you for presenting an intriguing perspective on neural approaches to approximating physical phenomena. This paper introduces a method to extrapolate a given dataset and predict formulae using naturally occurring functions such as sine, cosine, and multiplication.

Pros  
- The proposed approach is relatively straightforward, making it compatible with existing methods. A notable contribution is the successful incorporation of functions with two or more inputs, which distinguishes this work.  
- The observation that MLPs, while effective for interpolation, struggle with extrapolation is insightful. The decision to leverage basis functions like sine and cosine to enhance the model's explicitness is a commendable idea.

Cons  
- On Page 8, the claim that \( x2 \cos(a x1 + b) \approx 1.21(\cos(-a x1 + \pi + b + 0.41 x2) + \sin(a x1 + b + 0.41 x2)) \) for \( y \in [-2, 2] \) is not entirely accurate. There should be constraints on \( a \) and \( b \), as the approximate equality does not hold for all real values of these parameters. However, for specific values such as \( a = 2\pi \) and \( b = \pi/4 \), the claim is valid, indicating that the model predicts a correct solution within certain bounds.  
- The experiments primarily involve up to four variables. It would be valuable to explore how the neural approach performs when modeling systems with hundreds of variables.  
- Another perspective on the model is that the non-linearities, such as sine, cosine, and multiplication, function as basis components. If the data is a linear combination of these functions, the model can learn the corresponding weights. However, since division is not included among the non-linearities, predicting expressions like those in Equation 13 seems unlikely. This raises the question: is it possible to ensure that this architecture serves as a universal approximator?

Suggested Edits  
- On Page 8, there appears to be a typographical error in the expression \( 1.21(\cos(a x1 + \pi + b + 0.41 x2) + \sin(a x1 + b + 0.41 x2)) \). Based on the predicted formula in Figure 4(b), it should instead read \( 1.21(\cos(-a x1 + \pi + b + 0.41 x2) + \sin(a x1 + b + 0.41 x2)) \).
