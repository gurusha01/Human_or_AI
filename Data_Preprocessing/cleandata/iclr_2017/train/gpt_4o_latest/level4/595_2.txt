First, I would like to apologize for the delay in completing this review.
Summary: This paper applies variational inference to deep generative models, demonstrating improvements for non-negative sparse datasets. Additionally, the authors propose a method to interpret the data through the model parameters.
The writing is generally clear, and the methods appear to be sound. The introspection approach seems novel. I found the experiment on polysemic word embeddings particularly interesting. However, I would have appreciated an evaluation of how the resulting embeddings perform compared to more commonly used embeddings in a supervised task.
Minor:  
- Equation 2: There are too many closing parentheses.
