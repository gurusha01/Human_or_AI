The paper addresses an interesting topic, but it fails to present a compelling argument. In particular, the experimental section is lacking in rigor. The study would benefit from incorporating datasets that are well-known within the community in addition to those "less commonly explored by deep learning." Furthermore, the comparison with alternative approaches is insufficiently thorough.
