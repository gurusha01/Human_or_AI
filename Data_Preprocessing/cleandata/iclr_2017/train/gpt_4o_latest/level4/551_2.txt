Summary:  
--------  
The paper introduces a histogram-based state representation combined with differentiable motion models and observation updates for state tracking using observations. The motion model is a linear model with Gaussian noise, while the measurement model is learned via a neural network. The approach is demonstrated by tracking robot states in two scenarios: (1) a 1-D hallway and (2) a 2D arena.  
Positives:  
----------  
1. The work demonstrates how prior knowledge about state transitions can be effectively incorporated into the architecture.  
2. The observation model is learned entirely from data, with no prior assumptions imposed.  
3. The proposed method achieves better accuracy than baseline approaches, particularly in settings with limited training data.  
Negatives:  
----------  
1. The motion model is overly simplistic. While the authors suggest in their response that a generic feed-forward neural network could be used to model more complex motions, this raises questions about the novelty of their framework. If such a substitution is made, the proposed approach essentially reduces to using neural networks for both the motion and observation models.  
2. The observation model is also overly simplistic, relying on one-dimensional observations and being implemented as a generic feed-forward network. This again raises concerns about the technical novelty of the method.  
3. The histogram-based state representation lacks scalability, as acknowledged by the authors. Consequently, the proposed approach cannot be directly extended to more complex scenarios.  
4. In Figure 5(a,b), the comparison of state-estimation accuracy with baselines (e.g., LSTMs) shows that the accuracy of the LSTM has not yet saturated, whereas the proposed model's performance has plateaued. The authors should conduct larger-scale experiments with significantly more training data (e.g., 10k, 100k, 500k samples). While sample efficiency is an important advantage (as discussed in Section 6.2), it is expected that models incorporating prior knowledge will perform better with limited data compared to unstructured models. However, experiments with larger datasets would provide additional insights into the model's capabilities.
