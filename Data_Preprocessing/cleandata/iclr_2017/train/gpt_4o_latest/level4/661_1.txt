The authors present a semi-supervised approach for neural networks, drawing inspiration from label propagation.
The proposed method appears to be identical to the one introduced in (Weston et al., 2008) (though the authors reference the 2012 paper). The objective function optimized in Equation (4) is identical to Equation (9) in (Weston et al., 2008).
As a potential contribution, the authors suggest using the adjacency matrix as input to the neural network in the absence of other features and demonstrate its effectiveness on the BlogCatalog dataset.
For the text classification experiments, the adjacency matrix is constructed using neighbors determined by the word2vec average embedding. However, the reported top accuracies are not compelling when compared to the performance reported in (Zhang et al., 2015). The final experiment focuses on semantic intent classification using a custom dataset, where neighbors are also identified based on a word2vec similarity metric.
In conclusion, the paper offers limited extensions to the original work of (Weston et al., 2008). It essentially rebrands the algorithm with a new name, lacks any significant scientific innovation, and the experimental evaluation is unconvincing due to the absence of comparisons with existing baselines.
