I appreciate the authors' responses to my comments. However, after carefully reviewing them, I remain unconvinced about the novelty of the work and have decided to keep my initial rating unchanged.
This paper introduces a domain adaptation method for time series data. The main contribution lies in combining variational recurrent neural networks (VRNNs) with adversarial domain adaptation, applied specifically at the final time step.
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important and relevant problem in domain adaptation.
2. The writing is clear, and the paper is relatively easy to follow.
3. The empirical evaluation is thorough, with comparisons against several recent domain adaptation methods across multiple datasets.
Weaknesses:
1. The proposed approach lacks significant novelty, as it primarily represents a straightforward integration of existing techniques.
2. The paper does not provide sufficient justification for the specific combination of VRNN and adversarial domain adaptation (RevGrad). I remain of the opinion that comparable performance could likely be achieved by refining R-DANN, for instance, by carefully penalizing domain discrepancy at each time step.
Additional Comments:
1. I find the discussion in Section 4.4 unconvincing. The visualization of firing patterns does not, in my view, adequately demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
2. Figure 1(c) raises concerns. The highly regular structure depicted by t-SNE seems implausible for non-synthetic, real-world data, and I find it difficult to trust its validity.
In summary, while this is a solid paper, I am not convinced that it meets the standards of ICLR in terms of novelty and justification.
