In this paper, the authors introduce a method to explicitly regularize sparse coding by ensuring that neighboring data points are encoded using similar sets of atoms from the dictionary. This is achieved by clustering training examples in the input space using KNN. While the resulting algorithm is relatively intricate and computationally demanding, the authors provide detailed derivations and leverage arguments from proximal gradient descent methods to establish convergence (though I only followed some of the derivations, not all). Overall, the paper is well-written, and the authors thoroughly explain the motivation behind their algorithm's design.
The abstract claims "extensive experimental results â€¦," but I find the experiments less convincing. The authors evaluate their method on relatively small datasets, including the USPS handwritten digits dataset (why not MNIST?), COIL-20, COIL-100, and UCI datasets, with dictionary sizes ranging from p=100 to p=500. This is surprising given the authors' claim of implementing SRSC in "CUDA C++ with extreme efficiency" (page 10). More critically, I find the results difficult to interpret and compare. The paper reports accuracy and normalized mutual information (NMI) for an image retrieval/clustering task where SRSC is used as a feature extractor. However, the improvements over standard Sparse Coding are minimal (often < 1% in terms of NMI, though accuracy shows more promise). Additionally, if I understand the description on page 11 correctly, the test set was used to select certain hyperparameters (e.g., the best similarity measure for the clustering step). There is also no comparison to other baselines or state-of-the-art image clustering methods.
Beyond its application as a feature extractor for small-scale image clustering, could the authors explore more direct evaluations of the properties and benefits of their sparse coding approach? For instance, metrics such as reconstruction error, sparsity, or even denoising performance might provide more insight into the effectiveness of the proposed regularization.
In conclusion, I believe the paper, in its current form, lacks the depth of evaluation and experimental results necessary for an ICLR publication. While I find the proposed regularization to be an interesting and intuitive direction, the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate that the regularization achieves its intended effect. Furthermore, the improvements in the clustering task where SRSC is applied as a feature extractor are quite modest.
