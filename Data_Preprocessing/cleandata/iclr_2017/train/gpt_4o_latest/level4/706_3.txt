UPDATE: After reviewing the authors' rebuttal and considering the other comments in the discussion thread, my opinion remains unchanged.
The authors propose replacing a uni-modal prior with a mixture prior for variational auto-encoders. They argue that a simple uni-modal prior "limits the overall expressivity of the learned model, as it cannot adequately capture more complex aspects of the data distribution."
I find the paper's motivation questionable. While the prior may be uni-modal, the posterior distribution is not constrained to be so. Moreover, a uni-modal prior on the latent variable space can still model complex, multi-modal data distributions. (For example, consider a latent variable space with a uniform distribution and a likelihood function defined as a point mass derived by applying the true data distribution's inverse CDF to the uniform. Such a setup can represent any data distribution.)
Additionally, the focus on multi-modality in the latent space seems overstated in the literature. Often, the latent space is a complex, nonlinear structure, and it is not evident that a mixture of simple distributions provides a meaningful advantage. The experimental results do not clearly demonstrate how the prior's multi-modality improves the posterior's ability to capture complex phenomena, nor do they compare this approach to using a more sophisticated (but still reparameterizable) prior distribution.
I recommend rejecting this paper and encourage the authors to conduct a more thorough investigation into the effects of different priors.
Two additional comments:
1. While ICLR does not impose a length restriction, the 14-page manuscript could be significantly condensed without sacrificing clarity or the description of the proposed innovation. I suggest the authors revise their submission accordingly.
2. This paper raises procedural concerns. It was initially submitted with numerous incomplete details, including missing experiments, absent citations, a hand-drawn figure, and several missing paragraphs. These omissions were only addressed approximately a week later. I recommend that the conference chairs review this case and consider setting clearer guidelines for future submissions.
