The paper explores the application of deep learning to genomic SNP data, comparing various approaches to address the challenge of very high data dimensionality. While the approach is intriguing, the experimental evaluation is too limited to draw definitive conclusions about the relative strengths of the methods. The presentation would benefit from greater mathematical precision.

Quality:
The central idea of the paper is compelling, and the use of deep learning appears methodologically sound. However, the experimental evaluation is insufficient, as it is restricted to a single dataset and a small number of cross-validation folds. Given the substantial variability in the performance of all methods, it seems likely that the differences among the top-performing approaches are not statistically significant. A more extensive empirical validation would significantly enhance the strength of the paper.
---
Clarity:
The paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of both the biological and machine learning aspects. However, incorporating more mathematical rigor would improve comprehension of the methods. While the architectures are described intuitively, they would benefit from explicit mathematical definitions. For instance, the "raw end2end" model remains unclearâ€”given the limited number of parameters, it cannot operate directly on the raw 300k-dimensional input, but the nature of the embedding used is not specified.
The results in Fig. 3 could be made clearer by scaling each class so that its maximum is normalized to 1, thereby avoiding potential confusion caused by differing numbers of subjects across classes. Additionally, the text should adhere to standard formatting conventions, such as using the standard italics math font for symbols like \( N \), \( N_d \), etc.

Originality:
The application and the proposed approach appear to be novel.
---
Significance:
There is significant interest in applying deep learning to genomics, and this paper addresses some of the key challenges in the field. While it is too early to determine whether the proposed techniques will serve as a definitive solution, the paper introduces intriguing ideas that could inspire further research.
