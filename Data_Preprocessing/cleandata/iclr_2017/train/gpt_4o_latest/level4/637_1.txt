This paper proposes a method to extract explicit rules from the KB embedding space, formulating the task as a sparse reconstruction problem. The experiments showcase its capability to derive reasonable rules on several link prediction datasets.
The proposed solution appears plausible. However, I am unclear about the motivation for mining rules from learned KB embeddings.
- It remains ambiguous what kind of information is encoded within these KB embeddings, and it seems counterintuitive to derive rules involving negation or disjunction from them.
- If the primary objective is to extract useful rules for other applications, a comparison with approaches like "graph random walk" is essential.
