Paper summary: The authors propose a pedestrian detection approach combining EdgeBoxes and Fast R-CNN with batch normalization.
Review summary: The submission falls short in several key areas. The results are limited to a small set of datasets, fail to surpass the current state-of-the-art, and the writing quality is subpar. Furthermore, the work lacks novelty and broader impact. I recommend rejection.
Pros:
* Demonstrates that incorporating batch normalization can improve detection performance.
Cons:
* Results are restricted to ETH and INRIA datasets. Inclusion of larger and more diverse benchmarks like Caltech or KITTI is necessary.
* While the reported results are reasonable, they do not outperform the state-of-the-art.
* The proposed approach offers limited novelty, especially in light of prior works such as S. Zhang (CVPR 2016, Fast R-CNN for pedestrian detection) and L. Zhang (ECCV 2017, Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection).
* Writing quality is poor, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.
* The paper provides limited actionable insights or takeaways.
Quality: Low  
Clarity: Fair, but hindered by poor English  
Originality: Low  
Significance: Low  
To improve the chances of acceptance in future conferences, the authors should focus on refining the manuscript, achieving state-of-the-art results on additional benchmarks like Caltech or KITTI, and providing new insights or contributions beyond existing literature.
Minor comments:
* The writing requires significant improvement. For example: "influent" should be "influence," "has maken" should be "has made," "is usually very important" should be "is important," and "achieve more excellent results" should be "achieve better results." Consider seeking assistance from a native English speaker for future submissions. Additionally, sentences like "it is computational" are nonsensical and need revision.
* Citations should be formatted correctly, enclosed in parentheses.
* Some citations are incorrectly structured, with family names misplaced. For instance, "Joseph Lim, Lawrence Zitnick, and Rodrigo Benenson" need correction.
