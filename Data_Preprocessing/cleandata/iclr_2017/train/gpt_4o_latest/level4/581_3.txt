This paper builds upon the model proposed by Graves, incorporating a representation inspired by Plamondon's work.  
While a key objective of deep learning has been to minimize reliance on hand-crafted features in favor of learning directly from raw feature representations, this paper takes a somewhat contrary approach.  
The evaluation primarily relies on qualitative examples to demonstrate the system, but it does not convincingly establish that meaningful progress has been achieved.  
Additionally, the paper does not implement true text-conditional handwriting synthesis as demonstrated in Graves' original work.  
Ensure greater consistency in the bibliography, particularly with respect to variations in Plamondon's name and the use of "et al."
