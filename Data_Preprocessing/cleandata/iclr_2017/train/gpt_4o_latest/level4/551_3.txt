The authors present a time-series model with discrete states designed for robotics applications. However, I find the proposed approach overly simplistic in its current form. For instance: 1) the state space (in terms of dimensionality and topology) is specifically tailored to the experiments, 2) the transition model assumes linear displacements with respect to the actions, and 3) the observations are limited to a single dimension. These aspects place the method significantly behind the current state of the art, such as the work by Watter et al. (2015) on "Embed to Control," where state representations are learned directly from raw pixel data.
Additionally, the authors only compare their method to a standard LSTM model and fail to benchmark against other relevant approaches. I also suspect there is substantial prior work on combining Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Neural Networks (NNs), which the authors have not adequately addressed or cited. It would be important for the authors to situate their contributions within this existing body of literature.
