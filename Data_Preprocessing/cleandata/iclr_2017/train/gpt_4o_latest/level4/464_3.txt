In this paper, the authors introduce a novel method for learning hierarchical sentence representations using reinforcement learning. Specifically, they propose a neural shift-reduce parser that induces tree structures optimized for performance on a downstream task. The model is trained using reinforcement learning, leveraging the policy gradient algorithm REINFORCE. The reward signal for the learning process is derived from the evaluation metric of the downstream task. The authors explore two training scenarios: (1) no structural information is provided, meaning supervision comes solely from the downstream task, and (2) additional supervision is incorporated from an external parser's actions alongside the downstream task. The proposed approach is evaluated across four tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, textual entailment, and sentence generation.
I appreciate the idea of learning tree-based representations of text tailored for downstream tasks. The paper is well written and clearly presented. However, I remain unconvinced by the experimental results. On most tasks, the proposed model falls short of state-of-the-art performance:
 - Sentiment analysis: 86.5 vs. 89.7 (accuracy);
 - Semantic relatedness: 0.32 vs. 0.25 (MSE);
 - Textual entailment: 80.5 vs. 84.6 (accuracy).
From the results provided, it is unclear whether the performance gap arises from limitations in the model itself or from the reinforcement learning algorithm used.
PROS:
 - Innovative idea: learning sentence structures optimized for a downstream task.
 - Clear and well-written paper.
CONS:
 - Weak experimental results that do not fully substantiate the authors' claims.
Minor Comments:
 - In the second paragraph of the introduction, it could be argued that bag-of-words is also a widely used approach for sentence representation.
 - Paragraph titles (e.g., in Section 3.2) should end with a period.

UPDATE:
I remain skeptical about the results presented in the paper, particularly the claim that combining words in a manner other than left-to-right is necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that this is an intriguing research direction and that the results, while not conclusive, are promising. Consequently, I am revising my score from 5 to 6.
