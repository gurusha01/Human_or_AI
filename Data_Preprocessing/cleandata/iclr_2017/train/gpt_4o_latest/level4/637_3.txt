The paper introduces an interesting approach for directly identifying rules, such as brother(father) => uncle, within knowledge bases by performing a direct search in the embedding space. The core idea is to interpret the sequential application of relationships as the multiplication of relation-specific matrices in the non-negative RESCAL framework.
The experimental section evaluates the rules discovered by the proposed algorithm. However, the work appears to be in its early stages, leaving several important questions unanswered:
1) While the proposed method for rule discovery appears broadly applicable, the rationale behind its effectiveness is not well-articulated. What specific properties of the embedding space or the underlying algorithm are necessary for this approach to uncover meaningful rules? Could the same methodology be extended to other algorithms beyond non-negative RESCAL?
2) There is no concrete evaluation in the context of link prediction. How can these rules be integrated with the original algorithm to enhance link prediction performance? What level of improvement can be anticipated? Additionally, can these rules identify links that the original algorithm might fail to detect?
3) Scalability: Currently, the number of parameters in the rule-mining process scales as (relationships)^(max. path length + 1). How does this approach perform on standard benchmarks like FB15k, which contains over 1,000 relationships?
