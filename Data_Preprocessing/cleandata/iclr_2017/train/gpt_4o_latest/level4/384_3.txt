SUMMARY  
This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture tailored for the task of reading comprehension question answering, where the objective is to answer questions based on a given text passage.  
The proposed model integrates two well-established neural network architectures: Match-LSTM and Pointer Networks.  
Initially, the passage and the question are encoded using a unidirectional LSTM.  
Subsequently, an attention mechanism is employed to combine the encoded words from the passage and the question, allowing each word in the passage to be assigned a compatibility score relative to the question.  
For each word in the passage, its representation is concatenated with the attention-weighted representation of the query and passed through a forward LSTM.  
A similar process is applied in reverse using a backward LSTM.  
The final representation is obtained by concatenating the outputs of the forward and backward LSTMs.  
For decoding, a Pointer Network is utilized.  
The authors experimented with two decoding strategies: generating the answer word by word and predicting the start and end indices of the answer.  
The model is evaluated on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), where an ensemble of the proposed architecture achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.

OVERALL JUDGMENT  
The proposed model is compelling, particularly due to its use of Pointer Networks as a decoder.  
One potential improvement the authors could explore is incorporating a multi-hop approach, which has been demonstrated in numerous studies to significantly enhance the joint encoding of passages and queries. Conceptually, this could be viewed as a deeper version of Match-LSTM.  
The analysis of the model is thorough and provides valuable insights.  
Additionally, the decision to share the code is commendable.
