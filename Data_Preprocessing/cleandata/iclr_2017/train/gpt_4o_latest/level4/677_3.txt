The paper introduces a method for learning graph embeddings in an unsupervised manner using random walks. It is well-written, and the implementation appears to be highly accurate. The domain of learning representations for entire graphs seems to be relatively underexplored, and the proposed method benefits from having limited direct competition.
In essence, the approach involves linearizing the graph through random walks and computing the embedding of the central segment of each walk using the skip-thought criterion. As I am not a specialist in biology, I am unable to assess whether this approach is biologically meaningful, but the performance improvements reported in Table 2 are notably substantial.
A public anonymous comment compared this work to several others that address the task of learning node representations. While this is arguably a distinct objective, a natural baseline could involve aggregating these node representations using mean- or max-pooling. Conducting such a comparison would be highly interesting, particularly since the proposed method itself relies significantly on pooling operations (refer to Figure 3(c)).
In conclusion, I find this to be a strong paper, and with the inclusion of additional baselines, I would be inclined to further raise the numerical score.
