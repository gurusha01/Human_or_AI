Paraphrased Review:
Summary:  
This paper introduces an advanced self-learning model designed to extract compositional rules from Bach's chorales, building upon the authors' prior work by: 1) expanding the rule hierarchy across both conceptual and informational dimensions, and 2) implementing an adaptive 2-D memory selection mechanism that assumes features adhere to a Dirichlet Distribution. In this model, sonorities (columns of four MIDI numbers) are treated as words in a language model. Unigram statistics are employed to derive fundamental music theory rules, while higher-order n-grams are utilized to characterize part writing. Through iterative clustering of sonorities based on feature functions, partitions induced by these features are identified as rules if they meet a significance threshold. Consequently, the authors generated two sample syllabi with varying difficulty levels and "satisfactory gaps" based on the sets of learned rules.
1. Quality:  
a) Strengths:  
The exploration of hierarchies in two dimensions enhances the cognitive and interpretable nature of the learning process. Additionally, the authors demonstrate an effective memory selection mechanism that accelerates the learning process.  
b) Weaknesses:  
The paper restricts its discussion to N â‰¤ 5, which may constrain the model's ability to learn and interpret long-distance dependencies in music. (In their responses to questions, the authors mentioned experimenting with a maximum N of 10, but it is unclear why these results were not included in the paper.) Furthermore, while the interpretation of results is detailed, incorporating a survey of music students' opinions could make the evaluation of the system's performance more compelling.  
2. Clarity:  
a) Pros:  
The paper effectively conveys an improved automatic theorist system that learns and represents music concepts while thoroughly interpreting and comparing the learned rules with established music theory. Analogies and examples are appropriately used to help readers grasp the concepts more intuitively.  
b) Cons:  
Although detailed definitions are available in the authors' earlier MUS-ROVER I papers, a clearer explanation of the optimization process, particularly in Figure 1 and related sections, would be beneficial. Additionally, in the "(Conceptual-Hierarchy Filter)" row of equations (3), the prime symbol should appear in the subscript.  
3. Originality:  
The representation of music concepts and rules remains an open research area, and this paper explores the topic in a novel manner. It offers an alternative approach to interpretable feature learning methods, such as autoencoders and GANs.  
4. Significance:  
The paper provides meaningful interpretations of the learned rules in the context of music theory. The authors' suggestion that music students could actively participate in the self-learning loop is particularly intriguing. This approach has the potential to enhance the teaching and learning of music theory by integrating the model's strengths into educational practices.
