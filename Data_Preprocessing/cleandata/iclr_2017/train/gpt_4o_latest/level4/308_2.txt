This paper offers a significant contribution toward achieving a clearer understanding of the training procedure of generative adversarial networks (GANs).
By providing fresh insights into the training dynamics of GANs and their variants, the authors uncover the reasons behind gradient vanishing in the original GAN and instability in its variants. More importantly, they propose a method to address these challenges by introducing perturbation. I believe this work has the potential to inspire more principled research in this area.
I find the perturbation technique for mitigating gradient instability and vanishing particularly intriguing. Interestingly, this approach seems conceptually related to the dropout technique, where the perturbation could be interpreted as a Bernoulli distribution. It would be beneficial if the authors could elaborate on this connection. Additionally, beyond the theoretical analysis, is there any empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of this technique? Including experiments similar to Figures 2 and 3 for the perturbed GAN would provide a useful comparison and strengthen the paper.
