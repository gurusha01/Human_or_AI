This paper presents a novel neural network architecture and training methodology designed to predict a vehicle's speed several seconds into the future using video and vehicle state inputs. The proposed architecture employs multiple RNNs that compete to generate the most accurate predictions, with only the best-performing prediction receiving backpropagation updates at each time step. Preliminary experimental results suggest that this competitive approach can lead to reduced prediction errors.
However, it is unclear how the best-performing RNN is selected during the test phase. Specifically, how is the "integrated prediction" depicted in Fig. 7 obtained? Does the prediction correspond to the output layer with the minimum error across all RNNs? If this is the case, it raises concerns that the prediction may require knowledge of the ground truth value, which would not be available during inference.
Additionally, it is worth considering whether a larger, more generic RNN could achieve similar levels of accuracy. If my understanding is correct, the competitive architecture involves significantly more parameters compared to the baseline model. This raises the question of whether the observed performance improvements are attributable to the competitive scheme itself or simply to the increased model capacity.
Substantial additional work is necessary to support the claim that this approach effectively captures driver "intentions." For instance, it would be intriguing to explore whether the proposed scheme, with suitable extensions, could automatically distinguish between intentions such as stopping at a stop sign versus slowing down due to a leading vehicle, or passing another vehicle versus merely changing lanes. Incorporating labeled data into the dataset might facilitate a clearer evaluation of these distinctions.
On a broader note, driver intentions appear to be more closely tied to the goals they are actively pursuing. There is a body of work in inverse reinforcement learning that investigates this problem, including studies specifically addressing driving behavior and style, which could provide valuable context for this research.
