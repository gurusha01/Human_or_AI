The authors present an RNN-based approach for time-series classification with missing values, leveraging the potential information contained in the missing entries. Their method employs a straightforward linear imputation strategy with learnable parameters. Additionally, time intervals between missing values are calculated and used to adjust the downstream RNN computations. The authors show that their approach outperforms reasonable baselines on real-world datasets of small to medium size. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
In my opinion, the authors propose a sensible method for handling missing values within their targeted application domain, where data is limited, and smaller models are necessary. However, I am somewhat doubtful whether the advantages of this approach would extend to larger datasets, where more general, less manually tailored multi-layer RNN architectures could be viable alternatives.
