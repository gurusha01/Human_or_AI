This work employs steerable frames for various applications traditionally addressed by convolutional neural networks with location-invariant operators. The authors present a comprehensive overview of steerable frames, followed by an experimental section where a dynamic steerable network is applied to small-scale machine learning problems where steerability is conceptually advantageous.
Although the evaluation is limited to a few small tasks, the justification for this is that piece-wise pose invariance is relevant only to a subset of problems. The observation that using overcomplete bases as a form of "feature pre-processing" enhances the performance of already highly optimized architectures like ResNet and DenseNet is a noteworthy accomplishment.
For the edge detection task, the authors select a challenging baseline—Dynamic Filter Networks—which already aim to achieve position-invariant filters. The improvement in performance achieved by DSFN on this task demonstrates that regressing the parametrization of steerable filters yields better results than directly regressing the filters themselves.
In the final experiment, the authors apply the network to video classification using LSTMs and demonstrate that the improved performance is not attributable to an increase in the network's capacity.
Overall, this is an intriguing piece of work. While it does not deliver groundbreaking results (primarily due to the absence of experiments on larger-scale tasks), it is theoretically compelling and shows promising outcomes.
There are a few minor issues and suggestions regarding the paper:
* For the LSTM experiment, it would be helpful to include the total number of parameters, as the network estimating the pose also contributes to an increase in parameter count.
* Could the authors provide more details on how back-propagation is implemented through the steerable filters?
* For the edge detection experiment, it would be beneficial to include results for a standard baseline, such as a CNN with a comparable number of parameters, to better assess the utility of location-variant filters for this task.
* The last sentence in the second paragraph on page 1 is missing a verb and may be unnecessary.
* The hyphenation of "ConvNet" is incorrect in several instances (possibly using `\hyphenation{Conv-Net}` could resolve this issue).
