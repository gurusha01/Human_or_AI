The proposed method presents an intriguing structural approach to variational autoencoders, but it appears to lack sufficient motivation and a diverse set of application areas to convincingly demonstrate its effectiveness.
I appreciate the appeal of incorporating structural information in this context, and I find it more intuitive than relying on a flat sequence representation, particularly when the data exhibits a clear structure. However, the experimental results do not seem to provide compelling evidence to support this advantage.
A notable concern is the limited variety of applications explored. The experiments are quite restricted, especially given that the paper mentions natural language applications. It would be valuable to evaluate the latent representations learned by the model on additional downstream tasks and assess their impact on performance compared to various baseline methods.
Overall, while the paper introduces a potentially strong idea, it requires more robust results—possibly across a broader range of applications—to serve as a convincing proof of concept.
