This paper introduces a range of techniques for visualizing learned generative models, with a particular emphasis on VAE and GAN architectures. Evaluating this work is somewhat difficult as it does not propose a novel algorithm, model, or application. On the positive side, these techniques are highly pertinent to the generative modeling community, and I believe the paper warrants a broad readership. The proposed methods are straightforward, clearly articulated, and immediately applicable for practitioners working on generative models. However, I question whether this paper is a good fit for an ICLR conference track, as it does not offer deeper theoretical insights into sampling from generative models, nor does it include comparisons or quantitative assessments of the proposed techniques. Overall, I find myself undecided because, while the techniques are undoubtedly useful and the paper would benefit those interested in generative modeling, its alignment with ICLR's scope is unclear. I would consider raising my score if the authors could justify why ICLR is a suitable venue for this work.
Could you also clarify why spherical interpolation is advantageous when the prior distribution is uniform?
