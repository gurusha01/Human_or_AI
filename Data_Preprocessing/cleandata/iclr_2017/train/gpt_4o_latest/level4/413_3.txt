This paper presents an intriguing exploration of quantized networks that operate on temporal difference inputs. The central concept is that processing only the differences in input data significantly enhances computational efficiency, particularly with natural video data. This is because large portions of an image often remain constant, allowing the network to focus solely on the informative regions of the image (or video stream). This approach mirrors the functioning of the human visual system, making it relevant not only to the core machine learning community but also to broader interdisciplinary audiences.
As a side note, there exists a well-established community focused on event-based vision, such as the group led by Tobi Delbr√ºck. It might be beneficial to establish connections with this community, as their work could provide valuable context or references, particularly for the comments made on page 1.
The most notable contribution of the paper appears to be the replacement of a rounding network with a sigma-delta network, demonstrating that the sequence of discretization and summation impacts the computational load. I believe I have followed the methodology and reasoning presented in the paper, and most of my initial questions were addressed during the pre-review phase. However, one question remains regarding the statement on page 3: "It should be noted that when we refer to 'temporal differences,' we refer not to the change in the signal over time, but in the change between two inputs presented sequentially. The output of our network only depends on the value and order of inputs, not on the temporal spacing between them."
This statement is somewhat unclear to me. My understanding is that the network computes the difference between two frames, and whether this is termed "temporal" or not, it still represents a change within a single frame. As written, this statement is confusing and might be better omitted unless I am misunderstanding something, in which case additional clarification would be helpful.
Additionally, Figure 1 should be enlarged for better readability.
One area for improvement in the paper is the discussion of the broader significance of the findings. While the results demonstrate that the sigma-delta network reduces computational operations compared to a threshold-based approach, it would be valuable to elaborate on whether this difference is critical for a specific application or task. Furthermore, does this solution hold any implications or relevance for neuroscience? Expanding on these points would strengthen the paper's impact.
