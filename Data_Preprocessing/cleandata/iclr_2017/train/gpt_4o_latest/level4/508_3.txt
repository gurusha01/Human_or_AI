Some critical aspects of this paper are either inadequately explained or entirely omitted. While the proposed model appears intriguing and may hold potential, it is not suitable for publication in its current state.
Specific comments:
The explanation of the \( R_{l,\pi} \) convolutions in Section 2.1 is unclear. In particular, the meaning of the labels \( \pi \) is not sufficiently explained, leaving me uncertain about their role.
The description of the SAEN structure in Section 2.2 is poorly articulated. Based on my interpretation of Equation 1, the 'shift' operation seems to involve summing the representations of the member objects, while the 'aggregate' operation appears to concatenate the representations from various relations. However, for the 'shift' step, it would be more appropriate to average the member objects' representations \( h_j \) rather than summing them.
The compression technique discussed in Section 2.3 assumes that multiple objects at a given level share identical representations. This assumption is puzzling, as the representations are high-dimensional and real-valued. The explanation provided is incomprehensible: "two objects are equivalent if they are made by same sets of parts for all the \( \pi \)-parameterizations of the \( R_{l,\pi} \) decomposition relation."
The 'ego graph patterns' depicted in Figure 1 and the 'Ego Graph Neural Network' referenced in the experiments are not explained anywhere in the text, nor are any citations provided. As a result, I am unable to assess the validity or quality of the experimental results.
