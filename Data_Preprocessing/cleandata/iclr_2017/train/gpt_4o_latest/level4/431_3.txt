This paper is technically robust, effectively outlining both the strengths and limitations of the proposed simplified model.
Regarding its impact, the novelty is somewhat constrained, as the authors appear to have taken an appropriate approach and achieved predictable results. The concept of modeling deep learning computation is not particularly groundbreaking. However, as a companion paper accompanying the open-source release of the model, it would meet my criteria for acceptance, similar to a paper introducing a novel datasetâ€”offering practical value to the community even if it lacks transformative insights.
Without the release of the code, even with promises of future availability, I would remain hesitant, as the primary value of the work hinges on this aspect. The situation would also differ if the authors had leveraged this framework to derive novel architectural insights that enhanced training scalability and incorporated such findings into the paper.
UPDATED: The code has now been made available. Review revised accordingly.
