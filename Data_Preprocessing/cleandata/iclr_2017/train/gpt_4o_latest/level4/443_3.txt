This paper introduces the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) represents an input-to-output sequence pair, building upon the authors' prior work on the segment-to-segment neural transduction (SSNT) model. A key distinction of the noisy channel model from sequence-to-sequence approaches is that the full sequence y is not observed in advance. The SSNT model addresses this challenge effectively by enabling incremental alignment and prediction. However, this paper does not introduce any significant novelty beyond the SSNT model. The SSNT framework remains applicable by simply reversing the input and output sequences. While the authors note that a unidirectional LSTM must replace the bidirectional LSTM as the encoder, this modification appears to be relatively minor. The decoding algorithm detailed in the appendix is somewhat novel.
The experimental evaluation is thorough and robust, but one critical baseline result is missing across all experiments. Specifically, could you provide the performance metrics for the direct + LM + bias configuration? Additionally, including results for the direct + bias setup would be highly beneficial. Although incorporating a language model (LM) into the direct model may not be entirely justifiable from a mathematical perspective, it has been shown to work effectively in practice. The LM can rescore and smooth predictions, as demonstrated in works such as Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin by Baidu. This might also help explain why the noisy channel model significantly outperforms the direct model in Table 3. 
A few minor questions and comments:
1. Is the direct model used in your experiments based on the SSNT framework or a sequence-to-sequence model? This point is not entirely clear.
   
2. While the O(|x|^2*|y|) training complexity is acceptable, it would be valuable to explore ways to further reduce the computational cost. This is particularly important for long input sequences, such as those in paragraph- or document-level modeling, or in speech sequence tasks.
The paper is well-written and, overall, remains an interesting contribution. The channel model continues to be a topic of significant interest to the broader research community.
