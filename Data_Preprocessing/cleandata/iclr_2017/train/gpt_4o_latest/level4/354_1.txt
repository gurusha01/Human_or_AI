This study introduces a method to efficiently generate an ensemble of deep networks that surpass the performance of a single network trained for the same duration. The core idea involves employing a cyclic learning rate to rapidly guide the model into a local minimum, capturing a model snapshot at this point, and then increasing the learning rate to escape toward a different minimum's attraction basin. These snapshots, collected during a single training run, demonstrate competitive performance relative to baselines and exhibit some of the benefits of traditional ensembles, albeit at a significantly reduced computational cost.
The paper is well-written, features clear and insightful figures/tables, and presents compelling results across a diverse range of models and datasets. I found the analysis in Section 4.4 particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the availability of publicly shared code to ensure reproducibility is highly commendable.
I would recommend including a more detailed discussion on the accuracy and variability of individual snapshots, as well as a deeper comparison with conventional ensembles.
Preliminary rating:  
This is a compelling piece of work with strong experimental evidence and clear presentation.
Minor comment:  
In Figure 5, why does the axis for lambda range from -1 to 2, given that lambda is naturally constrained between 0 and 1?
