This paper evaluates various strategies for generating a short list of vocabulary for the target language in neural machine translation. The key conclusion is that word alignment dictionaries outperform several alternative methods.
My perspective on this work is that, to achieve a more substantial impact, the paper needs to provide a stronger justification for why one might prefer vocabulary-based approaches over character-level or subword-level methods such as BPE. There are likely compelling reasons to favor vocabulary-based approaches (e.g., capturing morphological synthesis, handling transliteration, etc.), but these would naturally point to specific models and experiments, which are not explored in this paper. As it stands, this paper makes a useful but modest contribution by demonstrating that word alignment is an effective method for generating short vocabulary lists. However, it does not convincingly argue for shifting focus away from other directions of research.
Minor comments:  
- In addition to the SVM-based approach for modeling vocabulary, it would be valuable to reference the discriminative word lexicon proposed by Mauser et al. (2009) and its neural adaptation by Ha et al. (2014).  
- It would be helpful to report the coverage rate of the actual full vocabulary, rather than the 100k "full vocabulary," as this technique could potentially scale to much larger vocabularies.  
- When reducing vocabulary size during training, the method proposed by Mi et al. (2016), which involves taking the union of all vocabularies in a mini-batch, seems like an unusual objective. Using the vocabulary of a single sentence might be a more principled approach since the probabilistic semantics of the translation model can still hold: p(e | f, vocab(f)) = p(e | f) if p(vocab(f) | f) = 1 (i.e., deterministic), which is the case here. In contrast, the mini-batch vocabulary approach compromises the probabilistic interpretation of the model. While implementing the single-sentence vocabulary approach may be more challenging, it would provide a more meaningful comparison.
