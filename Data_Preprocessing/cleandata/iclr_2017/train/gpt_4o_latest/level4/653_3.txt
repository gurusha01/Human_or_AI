This paper investigates the impact of mini-batch size on the convergence of SGD in a general non-convex setting and extends the findings to study the effect of the number of learners on ASGD. I find the problem tackled in the paper to be significant, and the theoretical analysis is presented in a clear and comprehensible manner. However, the experimental evaluation is somewhat limited. I would recommend including experiments on a wider range of datasets and architectures, along with a more extensive evaluationâ€”e.g., using N=16 represents a relatively small-scale experiment. Additionally, the paper would benefit from demonstrating similar behavior with other widely-used methods, such as momentum SGD or potentially EASGD (in a distributed setting). While I acknowledge that this last suggestion may fall slightly outside the paper's primary scope, incorporating these additional experiments would require minimal extra effort and should be considered.
