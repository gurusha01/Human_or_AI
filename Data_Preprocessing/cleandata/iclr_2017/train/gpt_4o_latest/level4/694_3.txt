UPDATED REVIEW (Paraphrased):
I have reviewed the authors' responses and would like to clarify that I did not consult social media discussions regarding this paper prior to writing my review.
I acknowledge the authors' efforts in addressing the reviewers' comments and appreciate the updates they have made. However, my overall assessment remains unchanged. The authors have tackled a previously unexplored task using a straightforward modern deep learning approach. While this is commendable, it is my belief that applying a well-established deep learning method to an underexplored task will naturally yield strong results. I do not consider such contributions sufficient for ICLR unless they also offer novel insights, in-depth analysis, or unexpected findings—none of which, in my view, are present in this paper. Of course, this perspective is general and may differ from that of the program chairs.
Additionally, I have withdrawn my earlier suggestion to consider this paper for the workshop track, as I have since realized that the workshop track this year has a different thematic focus.

ORIGINAL REVIEW (Paraphrased):
The authors demonstrate that a well-designed LSTM+CNN+CTC architecture performs exceptionally well on the GRID dataset for lipreading. This is a valuable result to be aware of—another example of the impressive outcomes that can be achieved when modern methods are applied to older tasks for the first time. The engineering effort behind this work appears solid and substantial. However, this alone does not provide sufficient novelty for publication at ICLR. Additionally, the paper requires revisions to better acknowledge prior work and to refine some of its motivational framing. Below, I outline specific areas for improvement:
- Claim of novelty in sentence-level lipreading: The assertion of being the first to address sentence-level lipreading is inaccurate. As noted in a pre-review comment, prior work on this task exists, even if it relied on non-public datasets. The paper should be revised to reflect this prior work, and the title should be updated accordingly.
- Comparison with human lipreaders: The comparison to human performance needs to be contextualized. The task's unusual grammar likely makes it unnatural for humans, suggesting that the machine's advantage stems from its ability to leverage strong constraints. While this is an important finding, it does not support a general claim about LipNet outperforming humans.
- Motivational language: Some of the motivational statements in the paper are unnecessary. For instance, citing Easton and Basala (1982) to justify modeling context in linguistic sequence prediction is redundant, as prior work (e.g., HMM-based lipreading) has also modeled context. Similarly, the McGurk effect does not directly demonstrate the importance of lipreading in human communication.
- Spatiotemporal feature extraction: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of spatiotemporal feature extraction, yet the Baseline-2D model performs very well even without spatial convolution. This point should be revisited and clarified.
Additional comments, minor issues, and typos:
- Provide citations for LSTMs, CTC, etc., at their first mention.
- The justification for upsampling is unclear and could benefit from further explanation.
- Clarify the term "lip-rounding vowels," as it seems to encompass nearly all English vowels.
- Consider discussing why you collapsed the vowel visemes V1-V4 into one category, given that you list Neti et al.'s full viseme set.
- The statement about British speakers and the confusion between /aa/ and /ay/ seems overly specific, as this relationship exists in other English dialects (e.g., American English).
- The discussion of confusions among bilabial and alveolar stops does not align well with the confusion data in Fig. 3(b,c). For example, there appears to be no confusion between /m/ and /b/ or /m/ and /p/.
- The term "lipreading actuations" is unclear—consider rephrasing.
- Correct typographical errors: "palato-alvealoar" → "palato-alveolar"; "Articulatorily alveolar" → "Alveolar."
