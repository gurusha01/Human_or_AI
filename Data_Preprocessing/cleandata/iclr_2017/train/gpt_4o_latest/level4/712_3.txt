Thank you for providing an engaging submission.
I find the use of a VRNN-type generative model applied to financial data to be quite promising. However, due to my limited expertise in this specific domain, I am unable to assess whether the reported performance improvements are substantial enough to warrant acceptance at this stage.
In my view, the primary concern with this paper lies in its level of novelty. The combination of RNN and VAE has been explored for over a year, and this work does not appear to introduce significant modifications to that framework. It seems that this paper might be more suitable for a conference focused on applications rather than ICLR. That said, I am not entirely familiar with ICLR's acceptance criteria, and it is possible that the committee prioritizes strong performance results and compelling applications.
