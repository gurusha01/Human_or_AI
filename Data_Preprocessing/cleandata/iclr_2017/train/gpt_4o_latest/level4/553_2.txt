Integrating storage and processing capabilities is a compelling research area, as data transfer poses significant challenges for numerous machine learning tasks.  
The manuscript is well-written; however, it delves into many aspects only to a moderate depth, likely due to space limitations. In my view, this work would be better suited for a journal that allows for a more comprehensive discussion of the technical details.  
While the authors adopted an intriguing approach to evaluate the system's performance, I find it challenging to discern the anticipated practical benefits of this method. Given the heavy emphasis on GPUs (and more specialized hardware like TPUs), one critical question arises: To what extent does this approach—or do you expect it to—outperform state-of-the-art GPUs on a real-world task?  
Although I have some familiarity with SystemC, I do not consider myself an expert in this specific domain.
