This paper presents an intriguing concept that enhances GAN by incorporating a bidirectional network. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and clearly conveys the contributions of the work. From a theoretical perspective, the proposed approach, BiGAN, retains properties analogous to those of GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that BiGAN performs competitively compared to other methods. While a potential limitation lies in the non-convex optimization problem associated with BiGAN, I believe the paper is still deserving of acceptance.
