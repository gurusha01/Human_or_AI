I lack expertise with the HJI PDE, as my prior experience has been limited to parabolic PDEs, such as diffusion equations. As a result, I find the process of reformulating this problem into a supervised learning framework somewhat unclear. Consequently, as noted below, my review should be regarded as an "educated guess." I suspect that many readers of ICLR may encounter similar challenges, and therefore, if this paper is accepted, the authors should, at a minimum, include an appendix that introduces the HJI PDE. My high-level comments are as follows:
1. One potential drawback of this approach appears to be the need to train a new network for each specific domain (including domain size), system function \( f(x) \), or boundary condition. If this observation is accurate, I question whether the effort is justified, given that existing tools can already solve these PDEs. Could the authors provide insights into whether a more "unifying approach" could be developed to generalize across PDEs with minimal modifications?
2. How robust are the network's results to variations in domain size? It seems that only a single domain size of 51 x 51 was evaluated. Do the errors scale with increasing domain size?
3. To what extent is this method applicable to other types of PDEs, such as diffusion equations?
