The paper tackles the issue of erroneous labels in supervised training. The problem is well-defined, and the proposed solution demonstrates novelty.
However, the experimental validation is somewhat limited. It is challenging to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in terms of its scalability to a large number of classification targets and whether its performance remains robust in such scenarios.
For instance, it would be valuable to explore whether the proposed method outperforms simply training on a smaller subset of high-quality data.
From Figure 2, it appears that the proposed method performs well as long as the noise fraction remains below a certain threshold but experiences a sharp decline once that threshold is exceeded. Providing an analysis and justification for this behavior—whether it is an inherent characteristic of the method or a coincidental observation—would significantly enhance the study.
