This paper proposes a method for video modeling that decomposes each scene into a background and 2D sprites governed by a latent hidden state. While the exposition is adequate and the approach appears reasonable, the primary concern lies in the absence of experiments on real-world, non-synthetic datasets. Consequently, although the graphics-inspired research questions explored in this work are intriguing, it remains unclear whether the proposed method offers practical utility for modeling more general video content.
In its current state, I believe this paper would be better suited as a workshop contribution.
