This paper introduces a novel model for sentence classification.
Strengths:
- The network incorporates some intriguing architectural decisions.
Weaknesses:
- The architectural choices are not evaluated. Conducting an ablation study is essential to discern the significance of each component.
- The model is not tested on standard datasets. Furthermore, in the sole pre-existing dataset used, a straightforward TFIDF-SVM approach remains state-of-the-art, making the presented results unpersuasive.
