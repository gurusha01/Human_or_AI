This paper explores the application of adversarial training and virtual adversarial training to LSTM-based models within the text domain. The manuscript is generally well-written and straightforward to understand. While the extension of adversarial training to text tasks is conceptually simple, it is by no means trivial. On the whole, the paper merits publication.
I have only a minor suggestion: it would also be valuable to investigate how adversarial training impacts the performance of RNNs, as they are simpler models and might offer greater ease of analysis.
