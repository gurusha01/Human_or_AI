This paper introduces a modification to the ELU activation function for neural networks, incorporating two trainable parameters per layer. The proposed parameterization aims to more effectively address the issue of vanishing gradients.
My primary concern with this work pertains to the authors' claims regarding the effectiveness of PELU. Sections 2 and 3 provide an analysis suggesting that PELU could enhance training by mitigating gradient propagation challenges. However, this analysis does not inherently imply improved generalization performance; it merely suggests that models might be easier to train. Despite this, the experiments focus exclusively on demonstrating improved generalization. It is possible that the observed improvements stem from a better inductive bias rather than the optimization advantages discussed in the theoretical analysis. Crucially, none of the experiments are explicitly designed to validate the claimed optimization benefits of PELU over ELU.
In their response to the pre-review question, the authors assert that the claims in Sections 2 and 3.3 pertain to generalization performance. However, I find this assertion unconvincing for most claims, apart from the flexibility argument. As the authors themselves acknowledge, improved training does not necessarily translate to better out-of-sample performance. While I agree that increased flexibility can sometimes enable a network to adapt its inductive bias to the problem (rather than overfitting), this is a considerably weaker claim compared to the mathematical arguments presented for improved optimization.
Regarding the selection of learning hyperparameters:
The authors mention on OpenReview that the chosen learning rates were favorable to ReLU but not to PELU. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the learning rates were also unfavorable to ELU. This raises an important question: could a scenario be constructed where ELU outperforms PELU? If so, how can the conclusion that PELU is superior be justified?
In summary, I remain unconvinced by the experimental design and the alignment between the theoretical claims and experimental results presented in this paper.
