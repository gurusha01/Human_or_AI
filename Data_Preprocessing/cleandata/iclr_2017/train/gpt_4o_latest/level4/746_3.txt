I find this paper very difficult to follow. Its primary objective is to train models for combinatorial search procedures, particularly for dynamic programming, with a focus on learning optimal split and merge strategies. The proposed methodology is intended to leverage a scale invariance property, but this property is poorly justified for many of the problems where the approach is expected to be applicable. Nevertheless, the overall research direction is both promising and significant.
The paper would benefit greatly from starting with a clear and formal problem definition, followed by a schematic overview of the methodology. This should include a breakdown of which components are supervised and which are not. Additionally, presenting a table or examples of the types of problems addressed by the method early on would help motivate the work. These examples should clearly illustrate how they align with the central paradigm and provide a concrete foundation for the rest of the paper.
Currently, the paper feels disorganized, frequently jumping between low-level and high-level details, as well as between problem formulations and their solutions, in a manner that is difficult to follow.
The split and merge phases appear to involve numerous discrete, hierarchical decisions during training. However, the paper does not adequately explain how these discrete choices are backpropagated through the network in an unbiased way, assuming that is even the case.
Overall, while the research direction is exciting, the paper in its current form is a frustrating read. Despite spending several hours on it, I was unable to form a clear mental picture of how the various components fit together. I would consider revising my score if the paper were significantly improved in terms of readability, but achieving this would likely require a substantial rewrite.
