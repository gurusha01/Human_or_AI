The paper evaluates several defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks, including retraining, two types of autoencoders, and distillation, concluding that the retraining approach introduced by Li et al. outperforms the other methods.
The study presents a series of experiments aimed at enhancing model robustness against adversarial examples. However, the proposed methods lack significant originality: RAD was introduced by Li et al., distillation originates from Goodfellow et al.'s "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples," and stacked autoencoders were first presented in Szegedy et al.'s "Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks." The most novel contribution of this paper is the enhanced version of autoencoders it introduces.
The experimental results demonstrate that the RAD framework is the most effective defense mechanism against adversarial attacks, which diminishes the impact of the proposed improved autoencoder method.
While the paper offers valuable experimental insights and could serve as a useful reference point for future work, its limited originality reduces its overall significance.
