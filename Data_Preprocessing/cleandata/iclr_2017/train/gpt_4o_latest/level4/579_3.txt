This paper introduces a hybrid architecture for time series prediction, emphasizing the slope and duration of linear trends. The proposed architecture integrates a 1D convolutional network (convnet) for analyzing local time series with an LSTM for processing trend descriptors. Features from the convnet and LSTM are subsequently fused into an MLP to predict either the slope or duration of the next trend in a 1D time series. The approach is evaluated on three small datasets.
Summary:
While this paper is relatively well-written and proposes an interesting approach, it suffers from several methodological shortcomings that require further experimental validation.
Pros:
The concept of identifying upward or downward trends in time series is intriguing. However, these trends should ideally be learned rather than relying on an ad-hoc technique, especially for a submission to ICLR.
Methodology:
- In Section 3, the statement about predicting "either [the duration] $\hat lt$ or [slope] $\hat st$" of the trend is unclear. Predictions are meaningful only if both are made jointly. The two losses should be combined during training.
- Throughout the paper, the joint prediction of trend slope and duration is essential. Predicting a time series without specifying the prediction horizon lacks practical utility. For short-duration trends, the time series could oscillate, while for long-duration trends, the slope might approach zero. Predictions should be tied to specific horizons.
- Time series prediction for applications such as trading or load forecasting is ineffective without actionable decisions. For instance, trading strategies differ significantly between short-term noisy oscillations and long-term stable trends. The evaluation should include trading profit/loss metrics for all baselines, including naïve ones.
- As previously noted in the pre-review questions, a critical baseline is missing: directly feeding the local time series into the convnet and connecting it to the LSTM without relying on ad-hoc trend extraction.
- The convnet → LSTM architecture requires an analysis of the convnet filters and their representation of trend prediction.
- Trend prediction or segmentation by the convnet could benefit from an additional supervised loss.
- A detailed analysis of the trend extraction technique is absent.
- In Section 5, the SVM baselines concatenate local trend and local time series vectors. Why isn't this approach applied to the LSTM baselines (as multivariate input)? Additionally, why does the convnet operate solely on local trends?
- A key "naïve" baseline is missing: predicting the next local trend slope and duration as equal to the previous local trend slope and duration.

Organization:
- Section 3 does not clarify how the maximal tolerable variance in each trend segment is selected. This explanation, currently in the appendix, should be moved to the main text.
- Section 4 is unnecessarily lengthy and reiterates well-known details and equations about convnets and LSTMs. The only deviation from standard descriptions is the concatenation of $lk$ and $sk$. The feature fusion layer could be succinctly described as an MLP applied to the concatenation of R(T(l)) and C(L(t)). These details could be relegated to the appendix.
Additional Questions:
- In Section 5, how many data points are present in each dataset? Reporting only the number of local trends is insufficient.
Typos:
- Page 5, top: "duration and slop" should be corrected to "duration and slope."
