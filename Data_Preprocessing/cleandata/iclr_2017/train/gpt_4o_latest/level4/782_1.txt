This paper proposes a novel hierarchical memory architecture for neural networks, structured as a binary tree where the leaves represent memory cells. This design enables O(log n) memory access, and the experiments further illustrate its capability to tackle more complex tasks, such as sorting purely from input-output examples and handling longer sequences.
The paper presents a novel and well-articulated idea, and the proposed memory structure appears to offer practical advantages. However, the primary limitation lies in the experimental evaluation. The paper lacks a comparative analysis with other external memory-based approaches (e.g., those mentioned in the Related Work section) and does not provide an experimental assessment of computational efficiency, particularly considering overhead costs, despite this being a key advantage. Additionally, the experimental setups are relatively limited, focusing solely on artificial tasks with moderate increases in sequence length. Addressing these shortcomings would significantly enhance the paper, as the underlying concept is compelling.
