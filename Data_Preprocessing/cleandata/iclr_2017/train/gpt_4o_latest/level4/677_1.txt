This paper addresses the graph embedding problem by employing an encoder-decoder framework. The experimental evaluation on real-world network datasets demonstrates that the features extracted by the proposed model perform well for classification tasks.
Strengths of the paper:
1. The application of techniques from natural language processing to graph mining is an intriguing and innovative approach.
2. The paper is well-structured and logically organized.
Weaknesses of the paper:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as Graph Kernels.
2. The problem is insufficiently motivated. Are there any practical applications? How does this approach differ from graph kernel methods? A comparison with graph kernels is notably absent.
3. Additional experiments are needed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction methods, such as clustering, search, and prediction tasks.
4. The presentation of the paper requires improvement, as there are numerous typos and unclear statements.
5. While the authors mention graph kernels, they do not include experimental comparisons with them. Furthermore, relying solely on classification accuracy to evaluate the proposed method is inadequate.
