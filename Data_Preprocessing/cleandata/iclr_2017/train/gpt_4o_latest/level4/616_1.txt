In this paper, the authors suggest employing a (potentially deterministic) retrieval function as a substitute for uniform sampling of the training data during the discriminator's training in a GAN.  
While I find the core concept intriguing, the experimental evaluation is severely lacking. There are virtually no quantitative results, no meaningful baselines for comparison, and only a limited set of qualitative results that are not particularly compelling. As a result, it is genuinely challenging to assess the paper, as it lacks the standard elements of experimental validation.  
Additionally, could the authors clarify what is happening with the curves in Figure 6?
