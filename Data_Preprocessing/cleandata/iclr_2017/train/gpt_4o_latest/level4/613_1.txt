This paper introduces a method that incorporates a causality score to weight a sparsity regularizer, enabling selected variables to balance between being causal and discriminative. The proposed framework is primarily tested on a proprietary health dataset. While this dataset provides a compelling motivation for the problem, the paper falls somewhat short of the standards for ICLR due to the absence of additional controlled experiments, the relatively straightforward nature of the methodology (especially when compared to the approach of Chalupka et al., arXiv Preprint, 2016, which offers greater technical depth), and a lack of robust theoretical justification.
At its core, the method essentially assigns weights to a sparsity regularizer to favor the selection of "causal" variables, as determined by a separate objective. While this is a promising idea, the experimental validation is insufficient, as there is no ground truth to confirm the results. For instance, a theorem addressing the identifiability of causal and discriminative variables from data, coupled with well-designed synthetic experiments, could have strengthened the paper's technical contribution and pushed it toward acceptance. However, in its current form, the work lacks the necessary depth in insight and reproducibility.
