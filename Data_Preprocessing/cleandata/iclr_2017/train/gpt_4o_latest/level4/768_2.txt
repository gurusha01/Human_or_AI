This paper introduces a modification to ConvNet training aimed at dividing feature activations before the linear classifier into groups, such that all feature pairs across different groups exhibit low statistical correlation. Instead of automatically discovering these groups, the authors propose a supervised approach, referred to as privileged information, to manually assign features to groups. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of image classification.
Pros:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- The experimental results indicate some advantages of the proposed approach.
Cons:
1. While the core idea of group orthogonality with privileged information is central to the paper, the introduction of background feature suppression appears insufficiently motivated and lacks thorough experimental validation.
2. The paper does not include a comparison with an ensemble-based approach.
3. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet under the "partial privileged information" setting would significantly strengthen the impact of the work.
This paper shows promise, and I would consider accepting a revised version. However, the current submission suffers from a lack of focus and insufficiently rigorous experimentation.
First, the abstract and introduction emphasize the goal of replacing ensembles with a single model that exhibits diverse, ensemble-like features. The expectation is that such a model would achieve similar accuracy improvements while reducing computational and memory costs. However, the remainder of the paper does not address this point directlyâ€”there are no experimental comparisons with ensembles, nor evidence that the proposed method achieves the desired trade-off between speed, memory, and accuracy.
Second, the technical contribution of the paper is framed around group orthogonality (GO). However, Section 4.1 introduces the concept of background feature suppression. While some rationale for this addition is provided, it does not appear to be directly connected to GO. Since GO does not inherently require background suppression, the inclusion of this component seems arbitrary. Furthermore, the experiments do not disentangle the effects of GO and background suppression, making it difficult to assess the standalone impact of GO. This represents a significant experimental shortcoming.
Minor suggestions/comments:
- The equation in Definition 2 contains an incorrect normalization factor (1/c^(k)^2).
- Figure 1 appears to have errors in the mask placements. The top mask should block the background and allow only the foreground to pass.
