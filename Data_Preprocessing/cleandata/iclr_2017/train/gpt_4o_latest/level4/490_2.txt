This study essentially explores the application of a combined pointer network to language modeling.  
The key innovation lies in targeting language modeling with extended context, where maintaining a memory of previously encountered words (particularly rare ones) proves highly beneficial for predicting subsequent parts of sentences.  
As such, integrating a pointer network with a standard language model strikes a balance between copying previously seen words and predicting new, unseen words.  
Typically, in applications like sentence compression using combined pointer networks, a vector representation of the source sequence is employed to compute the gating mechanism.  
In contrast, this paper introduces a sentinel vector to implement the mixture model, which is particularly well-suited for language modeling tasks.  
I am curious about potential variations in the implementation of the sentinel mixture, although the current approach has already demonstrated impressive results.  
Furthermore, the introduction of the new WikiText language modeling dataset is highly compelling.  
It has the potential to serve as a more standardized benchmark for evaluating continuously evolving language models compared to the PTB dataset.  
In summary, this is a well-executed and well-written paper. I recommend it for acceptance.
