This paper introduces an innovative and intriguing approach to address the challenges of performing inference on HSMM. The use of an embedded bi-RNN to approximate the posterior is both a thoughtful and creative idea.
However, I believe there are two areas that could benefit from further refinement:
(1) The paper would be strengthened by providing a justification for why a bi-RNN is capable of delivering more accurate approximations compared to alternative modeling approaches (e.g., structured mean field that employs a sequential model to define the variational distribution). Offering an intuitive explanation for the superiority of this modeling choice, beyond the empirical results, would enhance the paper's impact.
(2) The real-world datasets used in the experiments appear to be relatively small (e.g., fewer than 100 sequences). Including experimental results on larger datasets could further bolster the paper's contributions.
