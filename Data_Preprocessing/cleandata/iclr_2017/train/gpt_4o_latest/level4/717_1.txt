This paper presents three primary methodological contributions:  
- The introduction of Neural Feature (NF), defined as the pixel average of the top N images that strongly activate a neuron.  
- A method for ranking neurons based on their color selectivity.  
- A method for ranking neurons based on their class selectivity.  
The paper's main weaknesses lie in the relatively modest significance of the methodological contributions, as well as the lack of a singularly groundbreaking result derived from the application of these methods.  
Nevertheless, the paper's strengths are found in its collection of moderately impactful and intriguing insights into the fundamental behavior of neural networks. For instance, some notable findings include:  
- "Indexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers." To the best of my knowledge, this observation has not been previously reported.  
- The discovery of color-selective neurons even in higher layers, with 25% color selectivity observed in conv5.  
- "Our main color axes emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan, and cyan-magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidence in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011))." This is an excellent and noteworthy observation.  
Overall, I recommend accepting the paper. While it is difficult to predict its long-term impact, there is a reasonable possibility that one of the "smaller conclusions" could prove to be significant in hindsight in the coming years.  
Additional comments:  
- The citation for "Learning to generate chairs…" is incorrect, as the first two authors' names are combined, resulting in a confusing reference.  
- The computation of the Color Selectivity Index is unclear. The Opponent Color Space is not well defined and was unfamiliar to me. While it intuitively seems to identify units responsive to a single color, the highest color selectivity NF in Fig. 5 corresponds to a unit with two colors, not one. Furthermore, the last unit (with the lowest color selectivity) shows a similar edge pattern but with white → black instead of blue → orange. Why are these patterns considered so drastically different? This should be clarified further in the paper.  
- Consider the following hypothetical scenario: a neuron in conv5 is highly sensitive to mushrooms of any color but does not respond to other objects. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the Color Selectivity Index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, this could be misleading, as the neuron itself is not inherently color-selective; the dataset simply lacks variability in mushroom colors. This subtle but important point is worth discussing in the paper.
