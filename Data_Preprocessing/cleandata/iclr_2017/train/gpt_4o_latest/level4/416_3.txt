The authors introduce a novel method for estimating maximum entropy distributions under expectation constraints. Their approach leverages normalizing flow networks to apply non-linear, invertible transformations to samples drawn from a tractable density function, thereby enabling access to the resulting distribution's density. The parameters of the normalizing flow network are optimized by maximizing a stochastic estimate of the entropy, which is computed by sampling and evaluating the log-density of the transformed samples. This optimization incorporates constraints on expectations with respect to the samples from the normalizing flow network, which are approximated stochastically through sampling. To solve the resulting optimization problem, the authors employ the augmented Lagrangian method. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on two examples: a toy problem involving a Dirichlet distribution and a financial application focused on estimating price changes from option price data.
Quality:
The paper appears to be technically robust. However, I have some reservations about the application of the augmented Lagrangian method in the context of stochastic objectives and constraints. While the authors propose a solution based on a hypothesis test, it is plausible that this issue has been addressed in prior literature. It would be beneficial for the authors to discuss this aspect further and provide relevant references if available.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can outperform Gibbs sampling from the exact optimal distribution or, at the very least, achieve comparable performance, with the added benefit of yielding a closed-form density expression.
That said, I am concerned about the simplicity of the problems considered in the experiments. The Dirichlet distributions used are relatively smooth, and the financial problem involves a one-dimensional distribution, where numerical methods could be employed to compute the normalization constant and visualize the exact density. These examples appear to be relatively straightforward and do not adequately demonstrate the method's performance in more complex scenarios, such as high-dimensional settings or problems with intricate non-linear constraints.
Clarity:
The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
Originality:
The proposed method is not particularly innovative, as it primarily involves applying an established technique (normalizing flow networks) to the specific task of finding maximum entropy distributions. The methodological contributions are minimal, with the main novelty being the combination of normalizing flow networks with the augmented Lagrangian method.
Significance:
The results are significant in that the authors successfully compute maximum entropy distributions, which was previously challenging. However, the practical utility of this achievement is unclear. The real-world financial problem addressed in the paper could have been solved using one-dimensional quadrature methods. To enhance the significance of their work, the authors should consider tackling more complex problems with clear practical relevance.
Minor Comments:
- Additional details should be provided regarding how the plot in the bottom right of Figure 2 was generated.
- The phrase "a Dirichlet whose KL to the true pâˆ— is small" is unclear. Could the authors elaborate on how this Dirichlet distribution was selected?
- I revised my review score after reviewing the updated version of the paper, which includes new experimental results.
