This paper introduces an iterative query updating mechanism tailored for cloze-style question answering (QA). The proposed approach is both novel and compelling. Although the evaluation in the paper is limited to two cloze-style tasks (CBT and WDW), the underlying concept of read/compose/write operations appears to be more broadly applicable and holds potential for extension to other reasoning tasks beyond cloze-style QA. A notable strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to determine when to terminate the iterative process using an adaptive computation mechanism. This eliminates the need to treat the number of iterations as an additional hyperparameter, a common limitation in prior iterative models and multi-hop reasoning approaches.
However, there are areas where the paper could be improved. First, including results from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset would provide a more comprehensive comparison. Second, visualizing the entire M^q sequence over time t (rather than focusing solely on z or the query gating) would offer deeper insights into the query regression process and help assess its interpretability from a human perspective.
