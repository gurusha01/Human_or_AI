This paper is well-executed and presents a clear and concise exposition. It begins by building on the traditional attention mechanism framework. By interpreting the attention variable \( z \) as a distribution conditioned on the input \( x \) and query \( q \), the proposed approach naturally incorporates these variables as latent components within graphical models. The potentials are computed through the use of a neural network.
From this perspective, the paper demonstrates that traditional dependencies between variables (i.e., structures) can be explicitly modeled within attention mechanisms. This allows for the integration of classical graphical models, such as CRFs and semi-Markov CRFs, into the attention mechanism to effectively capture the dependencies inherently present in linguistic structures.
The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model across various levels, including sequence-to-sequence tasks and tree-structured representations. The experiments are robust and carefully executed, with thoughtful engineering efforts, such as normalizing the marginals within the model.
Overall, this work represents a solid contribution to the field, and the proposed approach has the potential to advance research in other related problems.
