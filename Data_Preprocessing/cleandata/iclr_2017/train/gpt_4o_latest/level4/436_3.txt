This paper introduces a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model designed to develop a natural language interface for tables. The proposed neural programmer is evaluated on WikiTableQuestions, a natural language QA dataset, and demonstrates reasonable accuracy. Performance is further improved through an ensemble approach that integrates components trained with varying configurations, achieving results comparable to the traditional natural language semantic parser baseline. Techniques such as dropout and weight decay appear to have a notable impact.
It would be valuable to include more detailed error analysis and identify the primary factors contributing to the relatively low accuracy compared to other NLP tasks. Additionally, clarifying the headroom and oracle performance achievable with the current method would provide deeper insights.
