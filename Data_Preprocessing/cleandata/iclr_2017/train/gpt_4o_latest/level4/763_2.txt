This manuscript presents a method for modeling correlated time series by leveraging a combination of loss functions that depend on neural networks. The proposed loss functions include: a data fit term, an autoregressive latent state term, and a term that encodes relationships between pairs of time series, where these relationships must be provided as prior information.
While the problem of modeling relational time series has been extensively studied, it has received limited attention within the neural network community. This may be due to the critical need for uncertainty in the representation. The authors correctly recognize this requirement and propose an approach that incorporates distributions in the state space.
The formulation itself is relatively straightforward, relying on a combination of loss functions. The model builds upon the work of Ziat et al. (2016) in certain respects, which are well-motivated but unfortunately not convincingly implemented. For instance, the treatment of uncertainty is not particularly rigorous, as the inference mechanism employed is rather simplistic. A more principled approach, such as using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework [1], would likely handle uncertainty more effectively. Additionally, the Gaussian covariance structure collapses into a variance, which is counterproductive for modeling correlated time series. Alternative methods, such as those in [2], explicitly account for these correlations in the latent states.
Another limitation is that the uncertainty modeling restricts the decoding function \( f \) to be linear, which significantly diminishes the model's expressive power. Contemporary methods in time series modeling have largely moved beyond this limitation, particularly in the Gaussian process literature [2,3,4,5]. A comparison with some of these state-of-the-art methods, or at least a discussion of their relevance, would strengthen the paper.
One notable innovation in the proposed approach is the requirement to provide prior information about the correlation structure. This is both a novel and potentially useful feature. However, it also introduces a significant limitation, as such prior information is often unavailable or impractical to obtain in many real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the specific regularizer used to enforce "similar" time series to be close in the state space raises concerns. Time series groups may exhibit varying degrees of similarity, and the nature of these similarities may differ across groups. Capturing such nuances with a simple indicator variable \( e_{ij} \) is problematic. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that these variables are treated as binary in practice (as evidenced by the experiments), which further limits the ability to model complex correlations.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method functions as intended, but they are not entirely persuasive. Crucially, the experiments fail to provide sufficient insight into the distinct contributions and sensitivities of the various components of the model, such as the different regularizers. For example, the effects and sensitivities of these regularizers are not thoroughly explored. While the authors mention in their pre-review response that additional results were included, no updated version is available on OpenReview (please correct me if I have overlooked this). From a performance standpoint, the results are underwhelming, particularly given the ambiguity surrounding which loss function performs better. This lack of clarity makes the method difficult to apply in practice.
It would also be valuable to report the optimized values of the parameters \( \lambda \), as this would provide insight into the relative behavior of the different loss terms.
Time series analysis is a well-established field of research. Given the points raised above, it remains unclear why this model would be preferred over existing approaches. From a methodological perspective, the paper does not introduce novel components that demonstrate a clear advantage over prior methods. The aspects of uncertainty in the latent states and correlation between time series are promising but are not adequately explored or developed in this work.
