This paper presents an energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and provides both theoretical and empirical results on modeling several image datasets, including large-scale subsets of ImageNet categories. While energy-based GANs (EBGANs) were initially introduced by Kim and Bengio (2016), the proposed approach incorporates several distinct design choices.
First, the proposed method eliminates the entropy regularization term introduced by Kim and Bengio (2016), which was designed to ensure that the GAN discriminator converges to an energy function proportional to the log density of the data (at optimum). As a result, the discriminator in the proposed framework will become uniform at convergence, as outlined in the theoretical section of the paper. However, the introductory text appears to suggest otherwiseâ€”that a meaningful score function could be recovered from the trained energy function (discriminator). This discrepancy should be clarified.
Second, this version of the EBGAN framework introduces two key innovations: (1) the adoption of the hinge loss in the value function, and (2) the use of an auto-encoder parameterization for the energy function. Unfortunately, these innovations are not empirically justified, which is disappointing. Empirical results supporting the rationale for these design choices would significantly strengthen the paper.
The paper makes two major contributions: (1) a theoretical analysis of the energy-based GAN framework, demonstrating that the optimum corresponds to a Nash equilibrium, and (2) impressive empirical results on large-scale image datasets, which set a new benchmark for what standard GAN-style models can achieve.
The theoretical results appear robust and represent a valuable contribution to the field.
Regarding the quantitative results in Table 2, it seems inappropriate to bold the EBGAN line, as its performance appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the results of Rasmus et al. (2015). Although not explicitly stated, bolding typically signifies state-of-the-art performance, which does not seem justified in this case.
This paper could be significantly improved by thoroughly exploring the two novel contributions to the energy-based GAN framework through ablation studies. Nevertheless, it is clear that this work has already influenced the field, as evidenced by its impact on at least two other ICLR submissions. Therefore, I recommend this paper for acceptance at ICLR.
