This paper focuses on submodular sum-product networks (SSPNs) applied to scene understanding. Sum-product networks (SPNs) have demonstrated significant success in deep linear models since the seminal work of Poon et al. in 2011. The authors extend the original SPN framework by incorporating submodular unary and pairwise potentials. Additionally, they introduce a novel inference algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Stanford Background Dataset and compared against several baseline methods.
Pros:
+ Novel formulation of SPNs incorporating submodularity  
+ Introduction of a new inference algorithm  
Cons:
- The paper does not address how the SSPN structure is learned or how the generative process selects a symbol (operation) at each level.  
- The evaluation is insufficient. Results are only presented for the proposed approach and baseline methods, excluding comparisons with other relevant approaches. Furthermore, evaluations could have been extended to the BSD dataset for standard image segmentation tasks, such as hierarchical segmentation.  
While the proposed idea is promising, the paper requires further development before it can be considered for publication. I recommend that the authors provide additional details about their methodology, including the learning process, and submit a more comprehensive version of the paper with extended experiments and a thorough evaluation.
