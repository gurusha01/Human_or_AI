I would like to begin by apologizing for the delay in providing this review.
Summary: This paper proposes a framework for two-sample statistical testing based on binary classification. The framework supports multi-dimensional sample testing and offers interpretability advantages over existing methods. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and report results from various empirical evaluations.
This is a very intriguing and promising approach. However, I have two primary concerns.
First, the clarity of the presentation is hindered by an overabundance of content. The paper would be more impactful if it were more self-contained. I suggest considering splitting this work into two separate papers to improve readability and focus.
Second, while the paper includes a large number of experiments, the experimental setup is not sufficiently explained. The reader is expected to be familiar with prior works such as Jitkrittum et al. (2016), Radford et al. (2016), and Yu et al. (2015), among others. While referencing these works is acceptable, this reliance on external knowledge significantly narrows the audience for your paper.
For instance, if I am not mistaken, the paper does not explicitly explain what SCF is, despite reporting its performance in the experiments.
Finally, given the increasing volume of submissions to this conference, I would like to pose the following challenge to the authors:
Why is this work particularly significant to the representation learning community?
