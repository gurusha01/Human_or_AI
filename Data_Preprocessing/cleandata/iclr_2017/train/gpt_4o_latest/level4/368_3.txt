The paper presents a method to evaluate generative models such as VAE, GAN, and GMMN. This is a valuable contribution to our community, where the evaluation of generative models often relies on subjective visual inspection of generated images. However, the technical advancement over the NIPS 2016 paper titled "Measuring the reliability of MCMC inference with bidirectional Monte Carlo" (Grosse et al.) appears to be minimal or possibly nonexistent (though I welcome any clarification if this assessment is incorrect). The primary contribution of this paper seems to be the application of the aforementioned method to generative models.
In Section 2.3, the authors appear to have made an error. They state E[p'(x)] <= p(x), but I believe they intended to write E[log p'(x)] <= log E[p'(x)] = log p(x). Additionally, for which value of x does this hold? If p(x) is normalized, this inequality cannot hold for all x. There seem to be typographical errors throughout, and the equations could benefit from greater precision.
On page 5, at the top, the authors mention that the AIS procedure can be initialized with q(z|x) instead of p(z). However, it is unclear which value of x is chosen in this context. Is it perhaps Ep(x)[q(z|x)]? This point requires clarification.
I am also confused by the use of the term "overfitting" on page 8 (bottom). Does model A overfit relative to model B if A has higher test accuracy than B, even though the gap between training and test accuracy is larger for B than for A? I do not believe this is the case. Perhaps the final sentence on page 8 should instead state that VAE-50 underfits less than GMMN-50.
The experimental results are intriguing, as they highlight that GANs and GMMNs exhibit significantly lower test accuracy compared to VAEs, despite producing visually appealing samples.
