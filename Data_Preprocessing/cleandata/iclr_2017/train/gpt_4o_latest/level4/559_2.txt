This paper introduces an enhanced version of matching networks, designed to improve scalability with respect to the support set in few-shot classification tasks. Rather than treating each support point independently, the authors propose learning an embedding function that aggregates information across all items of a given class within the support set (eq. 1). This approach is paired with episodic few-shot training, utilizing randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes to closely align the training and testing conditions.
While the concept is relatively straightforward and builds upon a substantial body of prior work in zero-shot and few-shot learning, the proposed method appears novel and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. One suggestion for improving the paper would be to provide a more detailed explanation of the training algorithm, potentially in the form of pseudocode, as the current description is somewhat unclear.
