This paper introduces a model designed for argumentation mining, which involves identifying and labeling the relationships between statements represented as sentence-sized spans within a short text. The proposed model integrates a pointer network component to determine links between statements and a classifier to assign roles to these statements. The combined approach achieves strong performance, surpassing robust baselines, even on datasets with fewer than 100 training examples.
I find no significant technical flaws in this work, and the results are compelling. However, I am concerned that the paper does not offer a substantial novel contribution to the field of representation learning. Its primary focus lies in adapting well-established techniques to address a novel NLP problem. As such, I believe this work may be better suited for one of the ACL conferences.
The use of a pointer network for this task appears appropriate, though (as highlighted by other reviewers) the paper lacks a thorough comparison with alternative methods for generating trees. While the quantitative breakdown of results is thorough, I would have liked to see examples of the model's output and a qualitative analysis of its errors.
Detailed comments:
- Figure 2 seems to contain an inconsistency. While the text states that the decoder generates a distribution over input indices only, the figure illustrates a case where the network points to an output index.
- "Wei12" does not appear to be a valid name.
