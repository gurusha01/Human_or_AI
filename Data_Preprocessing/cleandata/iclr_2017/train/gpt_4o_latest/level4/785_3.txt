The authors introduce a competitive learning framework where multiple RNN predictors are trained independently, resembling a committee of experts selected via a hard switch during execution. This approach is applied to predicting diverse driving behaviors exhibited by human drivers, with behavior combinations occurring at test time and frequent switching between behaviors within seconds. The proposed method achieves lower prediction loss compared to a similar non-competitive baseline architecture.
However, the interpretation of the results and the practical impact of the model remain unclear. If behaviors are switching so frequently, can this truly be considered as selecting the optimal driving mode for a specific scenario? Perhaps the motivation behind the work could be refined to make it more compelling.
While the competitive learning strategy is intriguing, it is not particularly novel, which may limit the contribution of this paper to a high-profile conference like ICLR.
