This paper introduces the use of tensor train (TT) decomposition to represent the full polynomial linear model. By leveraging the TT format, the computational complexity is reduced for both inference and model training. A stochastic gradient method over a Riemannian manifold is proposed to address the TT-based formulation. The empirical experiments provide validation for the proposed approach.
I find the proposed method to be both novel and highly interesting. I am inclined to recommend acceptance of this paper. My sole suggestion is to include an analysis of the computational complexity per iteration.
