This paper introduces a method to classify questions by utilizing their corresponding answers. The approach employs group sparse autoencoders to represent question groups.
The method demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the baseline. However, the chosen baseline appears somewhat outdated. It would be valuable to evaluate its performance against more recent CNN- and RNN-based approaches. Additionally, an analysis of the contribution of individual components would enhance the work. For instance, quantifying the specific impact of the GSA on the observed improvement would be insightful.
