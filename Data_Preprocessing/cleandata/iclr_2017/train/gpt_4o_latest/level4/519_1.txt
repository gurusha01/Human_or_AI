The authors demonstrate how normalizing the hidden states of an LSTM can help preserve their means and variances. They also analyze the gradient behavior of the proposed method. Experimental results suggest that the method performs comparably to similar approaches.
Points
1) The writing is inconsistent and contains several sloppy sections. A non-exhaustive list of issues is provided at the end of this review.
2) The experimental results show only marginal improvements, and their statistical significance cannot be assessed. For PTB, this limitation is partly due to the authors' reliance on previously published results. Weight normalization appears to be a viable alternative, offering similar performance and runtime. However, its implementation complexity is arguably much lower. The authors could have made a stronger effort to clarify this comparison. In its current form, the paper leaves practitioners and researchers with the burden of determining whether the proposed method is worth replicating.
3) Section 4 is well-executed, and I commend the authors for conducting such an analysis.

- "a LSTM" -> "an LSTM"  
- "The gradients of ot and ft are equivalent to equation 25." Gradients cannot be equivalent to an equation.  
- "beacause" -> "because"  
- One of the γx > γh inequalities at the end of page 5 is incorrect.
