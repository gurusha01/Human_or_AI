This paper presents a hierarchical clustering approach that leverages learned CNN features to construct a 'tree of life.' The core assumption is that feature similarity correlates with distances in the tree. The authors explore three methods for tree construction: 1) approximated central point, 2) minimum spanning tree, and 3) a multidimensional scaling (MDS)-based approach, with MDS yielding the best results. While this represents an interesting application of deep features, I am inclined to recommend rejection for the following reasons:
1) The experiments are conducted on a very small scale. The datasets include only 6 fish species, 11 canine species, and 8 vehicle classes. Additionally, there are no quantitative evaluations; the results are assessed solely by comparing the visualized tree with the WordNet tree. However, the assumption of using WordNet as a reference is questionable, as WordNet is not designed for biological purposes and may not accurately represent true evolutionary relationships among species.  
2) The technical novelty is limited. Most components of the pipeline are standard, such as using a pretrained model for feature extraction and employing existing methods for hierarchical clustering. Consequently, the technical contribution of this work appears minimal.
