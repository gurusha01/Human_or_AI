The paper tackles the significant challenge of the (d >> n) scenario in deep learning.  
The suggested method, which leverages lower-dimensional feature embeddings, is sound and enables the application of deep learning techniques to datasets with high dimensionality.  
The manuscript is clearly written, and the results demonstrate enhancements compared to appropriate baseline methods.
