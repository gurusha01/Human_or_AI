This paper explores an unsupervised method for the automatic segmentation of bioacoustic data. The authors utilized an established technique (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models) and applied it to a novel context. The primary contribution lies in examining this method on a new and arguably more challenging task: bioacoustic segmentation. The authors justify the complexity of this task by highlighting the lack of consensus among human experts on how segmentation should be performed. However, the results presented are not compelling, as the proposed approach frequently fails to reproduce the correct segmentations established by their baselineâ€”human experts. Furthermore, the paper suffers from significant issues in writing clarity, including numerous grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasing.
