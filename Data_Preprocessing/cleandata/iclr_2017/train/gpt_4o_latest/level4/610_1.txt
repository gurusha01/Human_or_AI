This paper conducts a series of experiments to systematically assess the robustness of various defense methods, including RAD, AEC, and its enhanced version, among others. It presents intriguing observations. Overall, RAD and distillation demonstrate the best performances; however, none of the methods effectively withstand the 'additional' attacks from cg or adam. Given that this is an experimental study, my primary concern lies in its clarity. Detailed comments are provided below.
Pros:
1. The paper offers a comprehensive comparison of the performance of the selected defense methods.
2. Section 3.3, which investigates the 'additional' attack, is particularly interesting. While the findings regarding the defense methods are largely negative, the results remain thought-provoking and insightful.
3. Overall, the paper delivers valuable and inspiring experimental findings related to the selected methods.
Cons:
1. The paper omits several other relevant methods from the literature. For instance, the defense and attack methods discussed in [1,2] are not included.
2. Although the paper provides an extensive set of experimental results, many critical details are omitted. For example, the specifics of the experiments that produced the results in Table 5 are not explained.
3. The lack of further explanation and analysis of the experimental results limits the overall contribution of the paper.
4. While the paper introduces an improved version of the AEC algorithm, its experimental results appear underwhelming.
Minor comments:
- Page 3: Equation (3) is also non-convex. Therefore, the non-convexity of Equation (2) should not serve as the motivation for introducing Equation (3).
