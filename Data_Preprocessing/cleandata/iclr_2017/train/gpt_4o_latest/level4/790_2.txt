The paper explores an intriguing application of adversarial training in the context of encryption. It examines the classic Alice, Bob, and Eve scenario, where Alice and Bob aim to securely exchange messages using a shared key, while Eve is tasked with being unable to decrypt the message. The authors conduct experiments on a straightforward symmetric 16-bit encryption task and also propose an application in the domain of privacy. The concepts, ideas, and prior literature are presented in a clear and thorough manner.
However, I have a significant concern—apologies to the authors for not raising this earlier—regarding the experiments in Section 3. Specifically, I find the scenario described there somewhat unclear. The reasoning appears to be as follows: given information <A, B, C, D>, the goal is to publicly release D (e.g., movies watched) without revealing information about C (e.g., gender). In this setup, Eve's role is to reconstruct D as accurately as possible without gaining any information about C. Yet, in Section 3, it is described that both D and D-public are reconstructed by Bob. This raises the question: why would Bob reconstruct D-public, given that he is not part of the "public" and is explicitly allowed to reconstruct C (which is not tested here)? Moreover, Eve's role is limited to estimating C, making this scenario essentially identical to the one already considered in Section 2.
I also have two minor concerns:
1) As mentioned in the pre-review, Eve should ideally be stronger than Alice and Bob to account for the fact that she lacks access to the shared key. The authors have indicated that they are conducting such experiments and plan to include the results.
2) In practical encryption scenarios, the key length is typically much shorter than the message length. This could potentially make the task easier for Eve (though I suspect the results would remain largely unchanged if the key is sufficiently long).
Overall, I appreciate the innovative application of adversarial training to a novel domain, and I believe this work could pave the way for exciting developments in cryptographic systems or privacy applications. That said, the privacy-related application leaves me somewhat perplexed, and the symmetric encryption example is not particularly compelling. I encourage the authors to address the major concern I raised above, and I would be happy to revise my score upward if this issue can be clarified.
