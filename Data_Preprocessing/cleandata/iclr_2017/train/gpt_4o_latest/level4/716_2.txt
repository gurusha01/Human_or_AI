This paper focuses on developing a real-time semantic segmentation network. The proposed method adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates several pre-existing techniques to enhance both performance and speed.
However, I am concerned that many of the design choices appear to be somewhat ad-hoc, with no ablation study provided to justify or validate these decisions.
Additionally, most of the components used in the approach are not novel to the research community (e.g., indexed pooling, dilated convolution, PReLU, steerable convolution, spatial dropout). The so-called 'early down-sampling' and 'decoder size' adjustments are essentially straightforward trade-offs between speed and performance achieved by reducing the size or depth of the layers.
The performance and inference speed comparisons are only made against a relatively weak baseline, SegNet, which diminishes the paper's overall persuasiveness. On public benchmarks, the proposed model fails to achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As noted by another reviewer, there are stronger models available that offer similar efficiency to SegNet.
While the speed-up improvement is notable, it is not surprising given the components employed. However, there is a significant drop in performance on certain benchmarks, which undermines the promise of these optimizations.
The one aspect I found impressive is the model's size, which is only 0.7MB. This is highly practical and advantageous for deployment on mobile devices. However, the paper does not provide any analysis of the trade-offs between model size and performance, nor does it explain how specific design choices contribute to model size reduction. Furthermore, there is no report on memory consumption during inference, which is arguably even more critical for embedded systems.
While this paper may hold some practical value for designing segmentation networks for embedded systems, I do not believe it introduces any significant or insightful ideas that merit discussion at ICLR, whether in the context of model compression or semantic segmentation.
