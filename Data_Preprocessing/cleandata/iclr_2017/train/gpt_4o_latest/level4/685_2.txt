This paper introduces a model aimed at representing unseen words within a neural language model. While the proposed approach demonstrates subpar performance in language modeling tasks, it shows a modest improvement over the baseline model.
However, the study requires a more thorough analysis:
- It lacks a comparison with existing works that address the same issue.
- The paper does not include an intrinsic evaluation or an exploration of why and how the proposed method might offer advantages.
- To substantiate stronger claims, further investigations should be conducted using additional morphologically rich languages. Specifically, for machine translation, experiments should extend beyond En → LanguageX to include MRLX → En and MRLX → MRLY scenarios.
