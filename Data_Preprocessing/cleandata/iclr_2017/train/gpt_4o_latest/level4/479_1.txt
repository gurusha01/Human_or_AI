First, I would like to apologize for the delay in providing this review.
Summary: This paper presents a novel memory-based artificial neural network designed for reading comprehension tasks. The experimental results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art methods.  
The originality of the proposed approach appears to lie in the implementation of an iterative procedure that incorporates a loop to verify whether the current answer is correct.
To better understand the source of the observed improvements, it would be valuable to include a complexity analysis and/or a runtime evaluation of the algorithm. Unless I have overlooked it, I do not see any discussion regarding the actual number of loops required in the experiments provided.
Additionally, the dataset description currently located in Section 2.2 should be relocated to Section 4, where the other datasets are described for consistency.
