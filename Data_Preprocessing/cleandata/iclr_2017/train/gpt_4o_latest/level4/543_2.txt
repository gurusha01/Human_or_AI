While the proposed approach is intriguing and may prove beneficial for certain use cases, it appears to target an audience outside the core ICLR community, which is generally comfortable utilizing standard ML toolkits. 
The paper does not introduce a novel algorithm or present any UI/meta-design enhancements aimed at simplifying the process of designing and training neural network systems for non-experts. 
As a result, I believe the paper is unlikely to generate substantial interest at ICLR, given its lack of contribution to advancing the state of the art. 
That said, I have no major concerns regarding the paper's presentation or methodology.
