The authors propose the use of chirplets as a foundation for modeling audio signals. They present a fast chirplet transform to enable efficient computation. Additionally, they introduce the concept of initializing (pre-training) CNN layers to emulate the chirplet transform of audio signals, drawing parallels to the scattering transform approach proposed by Mallet et al. The paper is generally accessible, though certain terms (e.g., AM-FM, MAP) are left undefined in some sections.
While the application of the chirplet transform is an intriguing idea, my primary concern lies in the limited scope of the empirical evidence, which is restricted to the specific domain of bird call classification. Moreover, the reported accuracy improvements in this domain are modest (61% MAP for log-Mel features compared to 61.5% for chirplet transforms). I encourage the authors to provide additional evidence demonstrating the generalizability of their approach to other audio tasks, including speech processing.
