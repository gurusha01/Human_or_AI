This paper introduces two RNN-based frameworks for extractive document summarization. The first approach, "Classify," processes the entire document and then revisits each sentence to make binary inclusion decisions (0/1). The second approach, "Select," also processes the entire document but iteratively identifies the most relevant sentence one at a time. Both models operate under the assumption that oracle extractive summaries are available, with a pseudo ground-truth generation method inspired by Svore et al. (2007) and similar techniques.
In general, this work represents a modest extension of Cheng & Lapata (2016), with comparable or slightly inferior performance to that prior work. The task of single-document extractive summarization is not particularly compelling, as even in DUC 2002 (14 years ago), existing models struggled to outperform the lead baseline (which simply selects the document's initial sentences). It is unfortunate that the paper does not tackle more engaging challenges, such as abstractive summarization or multi-document summarization. Additionally, it is somewhat disappointing that the model required a maximum sentence length cap of 50, indicating potential scalability limitations.
