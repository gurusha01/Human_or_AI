The authors introduce a theoretical framework to examine the recoverability of sparse activations in intermediate layers of deep networks, leveraging theoretical concepts from compressed sensing. They establish a connection between the computations performed by a CNN and a specific recovery algorithm (Iterative Hard Thresholding, IHT). The paper provides proofs of necessary conditions for recoverability and supplements these with detailed empirical evidence demonstrating their validity in practice.
This paper is well-written and offers a novel perspective on why current CNN architectures are so effective. The authors provide a concise yet adequate review of the basics of compressed sensing, clearly present their main result linking feed-forward networks and IHT (a surprising and insightful finding), and transition seamlessly into a comprehensive experimental section. The introductory analysis at the start of Section 3, in particular, effectively conveys the intuition behind the method using accessible and straightforward mathematics, which is a rarity in theoretical works. The experiments are presented in a logical progression, moving incrementally from artificial distributions to a realistic setting, which enhances the clarity of the results.
However, there are a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, while the treatment of ReLU non-linearities is adequate, the paper assumes with minimal discussion that max-pooling non-linearities do not pose significant challenges. A discussion on how these are inverted (e.g., using pooling switches) would strengthen the argument.
The connection between feed-forward networks and Algorithm 1 is based on the assumption of tied weights. It would be beneficial to note that this assumption is naturally satisfied in the case of RNNs, making the result even more robust in that context.
Although it may seem evident, it could be helpful for some readers if the authors briefly clarify that the reconstruction algorithm is intended to be applied sequentially to each layer, using the activations of the preceding layer (in reverse order, as in back-propagation).
Lastly, the filter coherence measure should be defined explicitly, either through a mathematical formulation or by citing an appropriate reference.
