Thank you for providing an engaging read on a method to select computational models based on the type of examples provided.
Pros  
- The concept of employing a meta-controller to determine the computational model and the number of steps required to reach a conclusion addresses a significant practical challenge of mitigating increased computational times for relatively simple examples.  
- The proposed approach bears resemblance to an ensemble learning framework. However, unlike traditional methods that rely on random experts and fixed computational complexity during testing, this architecture dynamically estimates hyper-parameters, such as the number of ponder steps, which provides it with a unique advantage.  
Cons  
- While the meta-controller is designed to select the optimal expert from the given set, its full potential has not been thoroughly explored. Extending the architecture to handle more than two experts would be an intriguing direction for further investigation.
