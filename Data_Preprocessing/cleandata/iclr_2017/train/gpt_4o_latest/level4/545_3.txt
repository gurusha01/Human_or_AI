Thank you for providing an engaging manuscript. The concepts discussed are well-founded, but the experimental evaluation appears overly simplistic. It would be valuable to include more comprehensive empirical evidence.
Strengths  
- The proposed approach demonstrates a reduction in training time, which is a critical factor in deep learning. However, this improvement comes at the cost of a slightly more complex model.  
- The paper builds on a solid theoretical foundation for sum-product functions, which underpins the compositional architecture introduced. Theoretically, the model can leverage any semiring and kernel, reducing the reliance on manually designing the model's structureâ€”a significant limitation in current convolutional neural networks.  
Weaknesses  
- The experiments are conducted on the relatively simple NORB dataset. While simpler datasets are useful for understanding a model's behavior, evaluating the approach on more complex datasets is essential to provide robust empirical evidence. Given that the compositional kernel method is compared to convolutional neural networks, it would be appropriate to benchmark the results on larger datasets like ImageNet.  
Minor Comments  
- Section 3.4 asserts that CKMs capture object symmetries, but the justification for this claim seems insufficient and could benefit from further elaboration.
