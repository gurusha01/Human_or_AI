I reviewed the manuscript as of December 6th.
The authors conduct a systematic study of various retraining strategies aimed at enhancing the robustness of classification networks against adversarial examples. Their proposed RAD and IAEC methods demonstrate lower error rates and outperform previously introduced distillation-based retraining methods in improving adversarial robustness. This approach represents a promising direction for developing defenses against adversarial attacks.
Major Comments:  
While the paper is not deficient in exposition and clarity, I find it lacking in focus and coherence. The related work section (page 2) presents an extensive list of results but fails to convey a clear and unified message. One key takeaway appears to be the superior performance of the proposed retraining techniques; however, it is unclear how these methods compare quantitatively and qualitatively to other retraining approaches. Additionally, the details of the retraining techniques themselves are insufficiently explained. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion and clearer exposition of the proposed methods (i.e., RAD and IAEC). Below, I provide more specific comments aligned with the need to improve the clarity and presentation:
- The authors should elaborate on the construction of the auto-encoder used in the IAEC method, potentially with the inclusion of a diagram. A similar level of detail is needed for the RAD method. The authors reference a prior workshop submission (
