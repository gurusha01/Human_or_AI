This paper aims to enhance corpus-based word representations by utilizing an external lexicon or knowledge base to identify, in a fuzzy manner, the most suitable paraphrase for a given context.
However, I found the paper challenging to follow due to issues with grammar and narrative structure, which made it difficult to stay engaged and, at times, rendered the content unintelligible. Clear communication of ideas is a critical requirement for a conference paper, and I believe this submission falls short of that standard.
Moreover, the evaluation is insufficient. There are numerous established methods for assessing word representations, yet the paper relies on Google's analogy dataset, which has well-documented limitations (see, for instance, Linzen's work from RepEval 2016 and Drozd et al., COLING 2016).
Lastly, the paper lacks qualitative analysis or clear motivation. It does not explain why the proposed method performs better, where it might fail, or what insights it offers regarding word representations, lexicons, or corpus-based approaches as a whole.
