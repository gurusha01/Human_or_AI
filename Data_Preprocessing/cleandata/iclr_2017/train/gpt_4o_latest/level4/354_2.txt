I don't have significant additions beyond my initial pre-review questions. To further enhance the paper, I would recommend conducting a larger-scale evaluation and including a more detailed discussion of the hyperparameters. Additionally, when reporting test errors for snapshot ensembles, it would be beneficial to provide statistics on the performance of individual ensemble members for comparison purposes (e.g., mean and standard deviation, as well as the error rate of the best-performing single member).
