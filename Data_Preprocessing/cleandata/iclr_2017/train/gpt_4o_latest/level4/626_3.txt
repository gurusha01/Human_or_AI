I appreciate the direction the authors are pursuing and believe it has the potential to yield something genuinely interesting. I encourage the authors to continue along this path and hope they can achieve significant results in the near future. However, I feel that the current paper is not yet ready. The results of this work are not clearly articulated, at least not to me. The preimage construction does not appear to be obviously useful or applicable in its current form. While it seems to be heading in the right direction, it has not yet reached a stage where it can be utilized to uncover the underlying mechanisms of our models. We understand that ReLU models need to partition and merge different regions of the space, and we can agree that constructing such mechanisms is theoretically possible (as it stems from the universality of ReLU models as approximators). However, this does not necessarily address what occurs in practice. Overall, I believe this work requires further development before it is ready.
