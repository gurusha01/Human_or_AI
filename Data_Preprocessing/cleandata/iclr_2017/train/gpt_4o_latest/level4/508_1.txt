The paper introduces a method primarily aimed at graph classification. The proposed approach involves decomposing graph structures into hierarchies of smaller subgraphs, followed by generating vector embeddings and performing aggregation using deep neural networks.
While the method is conceptually reasonable and intuitive, the experimental results fail to demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed approach. 
The method shows improved performance over Yanardag et al., 2015 and Niepert et al., 2016 on social network graphs but performs significantly worse than Niepert et al., 2016 on bioinformatics datasets. Furthermore, the authors did not report the accuracy achieved by Yanardag et al., 2015 on comparable bioinformatics datasets. For instance, Yanardag et al., 2015 achieved 80% accuracy on the NCI1 dataset, which is notably higher than the results obtained by the proposed method. The authors claim that their method is specifically tailored for social network graphs, but this assertion is not substantiated with strong arguments. Additionally, it remains unclear which specific types of graphs this method is best suited for.
