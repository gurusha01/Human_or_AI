This paper presents a novel approach to extending count-based exploration methods to domains where explicit counts are unavailable. The authors achieve this by leveraging hash functions. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments conducted on various domains, including control tasks and Atari games.
It is commendable that the authors validated the findings of Bellemare et al., demonstrating that count-based exploration can be effective when paired with an appropriate "density" estimator. Additionally, it is encouraging to observe that with suitable feature representations, the method can achieve partial success in challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge.
However, I have several concerns:
First, the use of hashing does not appear to yield significant improvements over prior methods. Without "feature engineering," the authors only achieve a fraction of the performance reported by Bellemare et al. on Montezuma's Revenge. Furthermore, in control domains, the proposed approach does not outperform VIME. As a result, the experimental evidence does not strongly support the efficacy of the method.
Second, while hashing may be effective in the specific domains tested, it may not be the most suitable approach for estimating densities in more complex environments. As environments grow in complexity, learning-based methods may become necessary to better capture their structure, rather than relying on simplistic hashing techniques. Although the authors argue that their method eliminates the need for designing density estimators, I would counter that modern density estimators (e.g., PixelCNN, VAEs, Real NVP, GANs) are now readily available and can be applied with comparable ease. Moreover, training these density estimators is no longer a significant challenge.
