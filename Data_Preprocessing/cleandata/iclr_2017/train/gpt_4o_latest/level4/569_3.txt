This paper presents a method for estimating the similarity between a set of images by sequentially attending to each image in a recurrent manner. The concept introduced in the paper is intriguing, as it emulates human behavior. However, there are several drawbacks to the current submission:
1. The paper is poorly written. The presence of numerous placeholders such as 'TODO' and 'CITE' in the final version suggests that the submission was rushed or that the authors did not invest sufficient effort in refining the manuscript. In its current form, I do not believe the paper is ready for publication.
2. The experimental results are incomplete. While the paper references the LFW dataset, it does not provide any results for this dataset. (At least, I could not locate them in the version dated Dec. 13th.)
3. The experiments on the Omniglot dataset are insufficient. I recommend that the authors include visualizations to illustrate how the model attends to two images (e.g., the trajectory of attention). It is particularly odd that the paper discusses the LFW dataset but does not present any corresponding results.
