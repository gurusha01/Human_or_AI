The manuscript enhances the NTM by incorporating a trainable memory addressing mechanism.  
Additionally, it explores both continuous/differentiable and discrete/non-differentiable addressing strategies.
Strengths:  
* Introduction of trainable addressing to NTM.  
* Inclusion of experiments with discrete addressing.  
* Evaluation on bAbI QA tasks.  
Weaknesses:  
* Significant performance gap compared to MemN2N and DMN+.  
* Absence of publicly available code.  
* Limited experimentation on additional real-world tasks.  
It appears that the footnote is omitted.
