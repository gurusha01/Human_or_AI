The time complexity of L-SR1 appears to be O(mn), but this detail is missing from your paper.  
Your experimental results indicate that L-SR1 does not outperform Adadelta (and likely Adam as well).  
Considering the time complexity of L-SR1, a time-based x-axis would imply that L-SR1 is significantly slower (potentially by a factor of m).  
The statement "The memory size of 2 had the lowest minimum test loss over 90" suggests that the primary contributing factor to L-SR1's performance was its momentum, implying that the second-order information played a negligible role.
