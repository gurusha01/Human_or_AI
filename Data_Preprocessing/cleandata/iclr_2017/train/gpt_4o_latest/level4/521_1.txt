While I acknowledge the challenges involved in gathering audio data from animals, I believe this approach to feature engineering is not the most suitable direction. I would prefer to see a model that learns feature representations directly from the data. It seems feasible to compile a larger dataset from sources such as zoos or natural habitats and subsequently train a generative model. The learned feature representations from such a model could then serve as input for a classifier. Since I am not well-versed in the specific nuances of this task, it is difficult to assess the benefits of employing chirplets.
