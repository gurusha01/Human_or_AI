This paper introduces a method aimed at "understanding" the internal workings of a neural network by employing linear classifier probes placed at various layers of the network.
Overall, I find the idea appealing, as it provides network designers with insights into the representational capabilities of each layer. However, the work feels somewhat underdeveloped. Specifically, the absence of results on "real" networks commonly used in competitive benchmarks weakens the impact of the findings. Without evidence from such networks, researchers aiming to design competitive architectures lack sufficient justification to adopt this approach.
I would strongly encourage the authors to further pursue this line of research and demonstrate how the insights derived from these linear classifiers can be leveraged to design improved network architectures.
Regrettably, in its current form, the work does not offer enough novelty to warrant acceptance at this conference.
