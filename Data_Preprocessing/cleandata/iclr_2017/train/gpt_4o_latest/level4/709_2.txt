Strengths:
This paper introduces a method to initialize the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model by leveraging the trained weights of language models without requiring parallel data. Following this pretraining step, all model weights are jointly fine-tuned using parallel labeled data, incorporating an additional language modeling loss.
The authors demonstrate that the proposed pretraining approach accelerates training and enhances the generalization capabilities of seq2seq models.
The key contribution of this method lies in its ability to utilize separate source and target corpora, in contrast to conventional approaches that rely on large-scale parallel training datasets.
Weaknesses:
The objective function presented midway through page 3 is largely empirical and does not explicitly establish how non-parallel data contributes to improving the final prediction outcomes. The paper would benefit from a comparison with and discussion of an objective function based on the expectation of cross-entropy, which is directly tied to enhancing prediction results, as outlined in arXiv:1606.04646, Chen et al.: Unsupervised Learning of Predictors from Unpaired Input-Output Samples, 2016.
Additionally, the pretraining approach proposed in this work shares significant conceptual similarities with the deep neural network pretraining methods described in Dahl et al. (2011, 2012). The authors should provide comparisons to these methods and clarify why their approach is conceptually superior, if such a claim is being made.
