This appears to be a solid study, though it falls outside my primary area of expertise. I did not identify any issues with the methodology or presentation, but I was unable to fully grasp the finer details or assess the work against comparable literature.  
The proposed technique seems to offer tangible benefits, primarily in terms of hardware efficiency, though it does not improve task accuracy. The selected tasks (AlexNet/VGG) are appropriate, but the results are based on simulations rather than implementation on actual hardware.  
The topic feels somewhat niche for ICLR, as it does not introduce novel advancements in learning algorithms or representations, despite the inclusion of "hardware" in the CFP. Consequently, I believe its appeal to the conference audience may be limited.  
Additionally, I recommend improving the use of parenthetical references, as the current formatting makes the references more difficult to follow.
