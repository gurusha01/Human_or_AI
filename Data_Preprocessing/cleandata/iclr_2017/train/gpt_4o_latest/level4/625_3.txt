This paper can be viewed as an instantiation of a seminal work by AI pioneer John McCarthy on learning to take advice, a concept further explored by subsequent researchers like Jack Mostow in the context of the card game Hearts. The core idea involves an agent receiving high-level guidance on solving a problem and deriving a low-level policy from it. This approach aligns closely with how humans acquire complex skills in various domains (e.g., learning to drive, where an instructor might offer advice such as "maintain a safe distance from the car ahead").
The authors employ a relatively intricate neural deep learning controller architecture, though the presentation of its specifics is somewhat unclear and difficult to follow. A simpler architecture might have been more accessible, particularly as an introduction to the approach. The experimental evaluation, however, is limited to a basic 2D maze environment, which raises concerns about the scalability of the method. It would have been more compelling to see its application to more challenging tasks typically addressed in contemporary deep RL research (e.g., Atari games, physics-based simulators, etc.).
Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea but suffers from a somewhat unclear explanation of the proposed solution and an insufficient experimental evaluation in a relatively simplistic domain.
