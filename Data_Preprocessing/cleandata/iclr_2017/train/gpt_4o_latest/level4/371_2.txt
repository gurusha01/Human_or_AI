The paper introduces a neural physics engine (NPE), which offers a factorized representation of physical scenes into composable, object-based components. NPE predicts the future state of an object by modeling it as a function composition of pairwise interactions between the object and its nearby counterparts. This approach aligns well with the physical principle of forces being additive. The study evaluates NPE in the context of 2D environments featuring balls and obstacles.
Overall, the proposed approach is compelling, blending neural networks with fundamental principles of physics in an innovative way. It has the potential to inspire significant and impactful follow-up work in the field. However, the primary concerns with the paper lie in its evaluation, which appears to be insufficiently robust in certain areas (as detailed below).
> Significance & Originality:
The approach is novel and interesting. While prior methods have aimed to model physical predictions, the idea of summing over pairwise terms is, to the best of my knowledge, unique and more closely aligned with the foundational principles of mechanics. Although relatively straightforward, this contribution is significant and important.
> Clarity:
The paper is generally well-written. However, the early portion of the introduction is overly abstract, making it challenging to follow until reaching the fifth paragraph. I recommend revising the introduction to include more concrete details about the approach or illustrative examples to make the text more accessible and engaging.
> Experiments:
There are two main concerns with the experimental evaluation: (1) The indirect comparison with Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) does not appear to favor the proposed approach quantitatively, which could weaken the paper's claims. (2) The role of the mask size on performance is not sufficiently explored. While the authors mention that the mask is helpful, they do not provide quantitative evidence to demonstrate its impact or sensitivity. An additional experiment analyzing the effect of mask size on performance would strengthen the paper.
In conclusion, despite the noted shortcomings that could be addressed to improve the paper, this work is intriguing and merits publication.
