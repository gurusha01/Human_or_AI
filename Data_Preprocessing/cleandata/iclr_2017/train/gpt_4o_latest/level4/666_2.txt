This paper introduces a regularization method for k-shot learning that leverages orthogonal grouping of units within a neural network. The proposed approach enforces maximal similarity among units within the same group while encouraging orthogonality between units in different groups. Although I appreciate the motivation behind the method, the empirical evaluation presented in the paper does not appear particularly compelling.
My primary concerns are as follows:
1. The performance of the method is highly sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters alpha and beta. Poorly chosen values for these parameters can lead to a significant performance drop, which contrasts with the relatively minor gains observed when alpha and beta are optimally tuned.
2. It is counterintuitive that the best results are achieved when the group's size ratio is 0.5. Based on the figures in the paper, it seems that filter banks typically contain more "orthogonal" groups. This discrepancy suggests that the empirical findings are not fully aligned with the theoretical motivation of the proposed approach.
3. The manuscript contains numerous typos and formatting issues in the references. Additionally, several sections are difficult to comprehend due to unconventional phrasing, which detracts from the overall clarity of the paper.
I appreciate the authors' responses to my pre-review questions and would like to request further clarification on the following points:
1. Question 2: I am uncertain whether modifying \theta{map} alone would result in any meaningful learning. Is my understanding correct that \theta{map} is solely used to define groups? If so, I fail to see how the proposed method could be applied in a purely unsupervised setting.
2. Question 3: My earlier comment was not about fixed clustering based on filters from a pre-trained network. Instead, I was referring to performing clustering at each step of the k-shot learning process. Additionally, I am unclear why the authors visualize the grouping of filters when the actual algorithm groups activations.
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting idea, it requires stronger empirical validation of the proposed method and significant improvements in the clarity and presentation of the material.
