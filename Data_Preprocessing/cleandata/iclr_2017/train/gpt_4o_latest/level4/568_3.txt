This paper introduces a character-aware attention residual network for sentence embedding. The proposed model is evaluated on several text classification tasks. While it outperforms some baselines on two out of the three tasks, it fails to surpass the simple TFIDF-SVM approach on the third task.
The contribution of this work lacks sufficient novelty. The use of character-level information has already been explored extensively in prior studies, as acknowledged by the authors. Similarly, the residual network architecture is not a new concept.
Why not evaluate the model on additional widely recognized datasets for short text classification, such as TREC? Furthermore, the comparison could benefit from including more competitive baselines. Additionally, the creation process and domain of the "Question" dataset remain unclear and need further clarification.
Finally, it is concerning that the citation format throughout the paper is incorrect. 
For instance:
like Word2Vec Mikolov et al. (2013)
should be written as:
like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)
