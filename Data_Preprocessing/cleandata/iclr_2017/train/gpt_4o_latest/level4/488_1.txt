The authors propose the application of virtual adversarial training to the task of semi-supervised classification.
At this stage, it is challenging to evaluate the algorithmic novelty of the approach. The field of semi-supervised learning is extensive, with a substantial body of literature (particularly related to SVMs, though some methods have also been applied to neural networks). Unfortunately, the authors neither reference nor compare their method to this existing body of work, instead focusing solely on the adversarial framework.
From the perspective of adversarial learning, the authors introduce a novel aspect by applying perturbations at the level of word embeddings rather than directly at the input level, which is particularly relevant for NLP applications.
In the experimental section, the authors concentrate on text classification tasks. However, a comparison with existing SVM-related literature is crucial to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, (Wang et al., 2012) report an 8.8% error rate on the IMDB dataset using a simple linear SVM (without a transductive setup).
In summary, the paper is well-written and presents a semi-supervised learning algorithm that demonstrates practical utility. However, it lacks theoretical and experimental comparisons with prior work, which are necessary to fully establish its contributions.
