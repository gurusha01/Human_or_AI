The authors introduce TARTAN, a derivative of the previously proposed DNN accelerator architecture, "DaDianNao." The primary distinction lies in TARTAN's use of bit-serial compute units, which perform MAC operations over multiple cycles. This design allows the compute units to more effectively leverage reductions in input activation precision, leading to gains in performance and energy efficiency.
Comments:
1. I echo the earlier reviewer's request for additional details regarding the methodology employed to estimate TARTAN's energy consumption. The authors claim a modest 17% improvement in energy efficiency, but I suspect this improvement may fall within the margin of error for energy estimation, raising questions about its significance.
2. TARTAN builds heavily on the overall architecture of DaDianNao, with its primary novelty being the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit. Unfortunately, this innovation comes at the cost of a significant area overhead, with TARTAN's compute units requiring nearly 3x the area of those in DaDianNao.
3. Despite these concerns, the concept of bit-serial computation is intriguing. In my view, this idea might be better appreciated and find greater relevance in a venue focused on circuit design or computer architecture.
