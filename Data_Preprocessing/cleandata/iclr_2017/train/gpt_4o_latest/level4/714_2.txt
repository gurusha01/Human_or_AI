The paper explores the use of the representation learning framework proposed by [Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015], incorporating a deep network as the function approximator. While the overall task and approach are intriguing, the contribution of this work is minimal, and the experimental evaluation is highly inadequate. As a result, the paper is not suitable for publication.
The method is evaluated on a simple synthetic task with very limited training and test datasets, exhibiting minimal variation in the data. The authors themselves acknowledge that the results are preliminary. Furthermore, the proposed approach is neither compared against existing methods nor benchmarked against straightforward hand-crafted baselines. This lack of comparison makes it impossible to assess the utility or performance of the proposed method relative to existing techniques, rendering the paper unsuitable for publication.
With a more robust experimental evaluation and demonstrations of the method's effectiveness in meaningful, realistic scenarios, this work has the potential to become a strong contribution.
