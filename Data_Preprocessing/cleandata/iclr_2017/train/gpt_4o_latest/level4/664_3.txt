I reviewed the manuscript as of December 6th.
Summary:  
The authors extend the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address the problem of steganalysis, which involves detecting hidden messages within a payload. They propose a novel model architecture that incorporates a new component, termed the "steganalyser," as an additional training objective within the GAN framework.
Major Comments:  
The authors present an intriguing new approach for leveraging generative networks in the context of steganalysis. However, the paper would benefit from further clarification of its foundational premise. Specifically, the practical application of the SGAN method is not sufficiently detailed. How exactly is this approach intended to be utilized? The rationale for employing a generative model in this context is unclear, given that steganalysis appears to be a classification problem (i.e., determining whether a hidden message exists). Would the envisioned use-case involve a scenario where a user has a message to transmit and does not prioritize the choice of the image (container)? Alternatively, does the network generate a synthetic version of a given image to serve as the container for embedding the message? Or is the SGAN designed to detect hidden messages embedded in images by any algorithm? Providing a clear and explicit description of the intended use-case would significantly aid in interpreting the results presented in the paper.
Furthermore, the experimental evaluation and analysis in the manuscript are relatively limited. The authors report only a few steganalysis performance metrics in Tables 1, 2, and 3. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to explore the parameter space and to quantitatively compare the proposed method with existing approaches (e.g., HUGO, WOW, LSB, etc.). Under what circumstances is this method preferable to others? Additionally, the impact of the seed value on the results warrants further investigation. Does a fixed seed correspond to a realistic scenario for applying this method?
Minor Comments:  
- Is Figure 1 essential to the paper?  
- Why does the seed value influence the predictive performance of the model?
