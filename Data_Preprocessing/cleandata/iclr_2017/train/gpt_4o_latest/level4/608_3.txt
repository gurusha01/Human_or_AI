The paper presents an intriguing exploration of employing the Sine function as an activation function, demonstrating its effectiveness in training models. However, the range of tasks to which this approach has been applied feels somewhat narrow to be fully persuasive. Including results on more significant tasks, alongside the current toy examples, could strengthen the impact of the work.
