This paper investigates three language modeling applications that explicitly incorporate the modeling of reference expressions: dialogue, recipe generation, and coreference resolution. While these are significant tasks in NLP and the authors have conducted several experiments, the paper has certain limitations:
1. The paper is not clearly written and is difficult to follow in some parts. Specifically, there are several apparent mathematical errors, such as the omission of the marginalization sum in Eq. (1) and the incorrect statement that P(z_{i,v}...) = 1 (which should be 0) in the pointer switch section on page 5.
2. The primary contribution appears to be the introduction of 2-dimensional attention for tables and the use of a pointer mechanism for the 2-D table. However, these contributions largely represent adaptations of existing methods to a specific task involving 2-D tables as part of the input to a sequence-to-sequence model with attention and pointer networks.
3. The empirical results are not yet very compelling, likely due to either the relatively small dataset size or the absence of well-established baselines for certain new applications (e.g., the recipe generation task).
In summary, this paper, in its current form, is better suited for a workshop rather than the main conference.
