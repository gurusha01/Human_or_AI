The paper provides a compelling and highly detailed investigation into targeted and non-targeted adversarial examples in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
I am somewhat undecided about this paper but lean towards recommending acceptance. Conducting such thorough empirical studies is challenging and time-intensive, yet they often serve as valuable foundations for future research. I consider the paper's length to be an asset, as it enables a comprehensive exploration of the effectiveness and transferability of various adversarial examples.
However, I do have some reservations:
1) While the paper's length is a strength, the primary contributions need to be articulated more clearly. As noted earlier, I found myself confused at times, particularly regarding the ensemble versus non-ensemble method and the role of the Clarifai evaluation. A significant revision is needed to streamline the narrative and emphasize the key contributions more explicitly. For instance:
- Begin by demonstrating that non-targeted attacks are relatively straightforward, whereas targeted attacks are more challenging (supported by a key experiment comparing the two, with references to the appendix or later sections for the more extensive analysis, such as the current Section 3).
- Next, introduce the proposed ensemble method, which significantly improves performance on targeted attacks (validated by experiments comparing the ensemble and non-ensemble methods, both in controlled settings and on Clarifai).
- Finally, present the additional details and broader explorations.
2) The choice of models in the ensemble could be improved. Instead of including ResNet-152, ResNet-101, and ResNet-50 as three of the five models, it would be more compelling to use only one ResNet architecture and incorporate two other distinct architectures, such as AlexNet and Network-in-Network. This would make the ensemble results more robust and persuasive.
