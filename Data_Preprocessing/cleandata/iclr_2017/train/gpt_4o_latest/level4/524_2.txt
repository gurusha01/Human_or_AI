The idea of performing data augmentation in the embedding space is highly intriguing. The proposed method is well-articulated and validated across various tasks, including spoken digit recognition and image classification.
One point of critique concerns the use of a simple 2-layer MLP as the baseline model across all tasks. It remains unclear whether the observed improvements would persist when employing a more complex baseline model.
Another point pertains to the use of augmented context vectors for classification. It would be interesting to see how this approach compares to using the reconstructed inputs instead. Additionally, as shown in Table 4, both input space and feature space extrapolation lead to performance gains. A question arises as to whether these two approaches are complementary or if their benefits overlap.
