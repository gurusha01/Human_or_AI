This paper investigates ensemble optimization within the framework of policy-gradient training. Ensemble training has long been an underexplored yet promising area in this field, and this work finally addresses this compelling topic. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Notably, the questions raised in Section 4 are both well-formulated and thought-provoking.
However, the paper does exhibit some significant weaknesses, most notably that all the results are confined to a very specific set of domain and parameter choices. I am eager to see a journal version where these experiments are extended to encompass a broader range of source domain/target domain/parameter configurations.
