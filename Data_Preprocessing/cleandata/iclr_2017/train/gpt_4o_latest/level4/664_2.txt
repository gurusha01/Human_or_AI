I found this paper to be highly original and thought-provoking, though somewhat challenging to follow in certain parts. It is exciting to see a practical application of image-generating GANs, with the potential for meaningful benchmarks beyond subjective realism.
Equation 4 caught my attention as it incorporates a potentially non-differentiable black-box function, Stego(...), into the training of (S, G). Do you actually perform backpropagation through the Stego function?
- Regarding the train/test split, why is the SGAN trained on all 200k images? Would it not be more consistent to use the same splits for training SGAN as those used for "steganalysis purposes"? Could this discrepancy explain the sensitivity to random seeds observed in Table 2?
- Section 5.3 states: "Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can potentially be used as a universal tool for generating Steganography containers tuned to deceive any specific steganalysis algorithm." While the experiment demonstrates that SGAN can fool HUGO, it is unclear how SGAN was specifically "tuned" to deceive HUGO or how it could be adapted to target other steganalyzers in general.
Although S appears to be fooled by the proposed method, it is worth noting that, in the broader context of image generation, the discriminator D in contemporary GANs is almost never completely fooled. That is, while GANs can produce samples that occasionally deceive humans, they do not converge to consistently fooling the discriminator. What if an additional steganalyzer S(x) = S(x) * D(x) were introduced? This would likely be significantly harder to fool reliably, as it would require generating images that are both realistic and steganographically deceptive.
Even after multiple readings, it remains somewhat unclear how or why one would practically use a trained SGAN. The paper could benefit greatly from a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the workflow for a hypothetical user employing a trained SGAN. This explanation should be tailored to an audience with minimal or no prior knowledge of steganography (e.g., the majority of ICLR attendees).
