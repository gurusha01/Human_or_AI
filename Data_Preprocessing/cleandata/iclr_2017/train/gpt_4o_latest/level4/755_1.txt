The manuscript could benefit from further refinement. The paper's results may potentially be misleading, as the analysis of the model's behavior when weights are zero does not provide a comprehensive understanding of its general functioning. Additionally, the study appears to undervalue the impact of nonlinearities on the model's learning dynamics.
