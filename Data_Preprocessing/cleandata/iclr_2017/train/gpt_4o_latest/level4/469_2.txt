The authors present a well-crafted approach to leveraging sparsity in convolutional layers of deep networks by reformulating the problem as sparse matrix-vector multiplication. This results in significant speedups, and the accompanying analysis of the conditions under which this is feasible is valuable for practitioners. My primary concern with the paper is that its contribution appears to be more focused on performance engineering and benchmarking rather than advancing fundamental research. It is ultimately up to the area chairs to determine the suitability of such a paper for inclusion at ICLR.
