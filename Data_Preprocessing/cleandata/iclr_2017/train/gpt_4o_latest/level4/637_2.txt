This paper introduces a method for extracting rules from vector space representations derived from knowledge bases (using nonnegative RESCAL).
The paper is well-written.  
However, its motivations are not clearly articulated: what is the fundamental purpose of mining rules from embedding spaces?  
- If the goal is to improve link prediction performance, the paper does not demonstrate this. The experiments fail to compare the performance of FRM with that of the original vector space model.  
- If the aim is to enhance interpretability and facilitate debugging of the representations learned by vector space models, the paper should include more content addressing this aspect.
Additional comments:  
- The absence of baseline comparisons for the methods in Figures 1 and 2 is a significant issue.  
- The scalability limitations of the rule miner represent a major drawback that needs to be addressed.  
- Figure 3 is unconvincing in supporting the use of rule-based systems for prediction or interpretation. The learned rules are inadequate for both purposes.
