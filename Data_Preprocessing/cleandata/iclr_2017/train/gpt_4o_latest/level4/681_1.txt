I find the overall direction of the work to be promising; however, the paper, in my view, has three primary shortcomings. While the motivation and central idea appear reasonable, the mathematical derivation lacks rigor and is not entirely convincing. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is limited, and the presentation requires substantial improvement. The writing is generally poorly structured, making it challenging at times to follow the proposed ideas. The organization of the paper needs refinement, and the connections between sections are not well established. A significant improvement could be achieved by thoroughly re-writing the manuscript.
I am not entirely persuaded by the motivation for the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2) as described on page 5. The authors reference (Waldspurger, 2016) to justify that higher-order nonlinearities might enhance sparsity. However, unless I have misunderstood, that work seems to suggest that higher-order nonlinearities can generally be neglected. Could the authors clarify this point?
That said, incorporating a second-order term into the descriptor is an interesting direction, provided that stability to small variations is maintained. This stability should ideally be demonstrated experimentally.
The experimental section is underdeveloped. A more comprehensive numerical evaluation would strengthen the paper. The current results do not convincingly demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. To better highlight the merits of the proposed approach, it would be helpful to include direct comparisons of running times and compression rates.
Questions:  
- Can you provide empirical evidence showing that the proposed higher-order nonlinearity yields sparser representations compared to the complex modulus?
Other minor issues:  
- The proof in Section 2.1 should be preceded by a formal statement presented as a proposition.  
- "Hadamart" should be corrected to "Hadamard."  
- Replace "Valid set" with "Validation set."  
- Change "nonzeros coefficients" to "nonzero coefficients."  
- Figure 3 is difficult to interpret; please provide additional details for clarity.  
- Figure 5 is intended to show a comparison with a standard implementation of the scattering network, but such a comparison is not evident in the figure. Please clarify.  
- Verify the references. For instance, the first reference lists "MALLAT," which should be corrected.
