The authors introduce a variational autoencoder tailored for a specific type of tree-generating model.
While the proposed generative model for trees appears reasonable, its motivation is insufficiently developed. If no prior work explicitly suggests this tree specification, the authors should provide a more detailed justification—particularly for the extension beyond CFG—beyond the brief explanation currently included.
Given the tree model, specifying a corresponding tree-based encoder might seem intuitive. However, the posterior distribution does not align with the structure of the prior (as it introduces dependencies between tree-distant variables), which undermines the rationale for this specific form. A comparison with a more general network architecture would be valuable.
The method incorporates well-defined differentiable functions for encoding the network. The experimental results are suggestive but closely resemble those of the baseline approaches, leaving ambiguity about the most appropriate evaluation metric.
Significance: While the work has potential future significance, it currently feels somewhat preliminary. It lacks sufficient motivation, adopts a tree-structured encoder without strong justification, and does not include broader comparisons. Additionally, the model's current relevance is unclear, and no comparisons are made with simpler, tractable models that do not rely on a variational autoencoder.
Originality: The work is original, but its necessity is not yet convincingly demonstrated.
Clarity: The paper is well-written and clear.
Experiments: The experiments are reasonable but lack breadth and definitive conclusions.
