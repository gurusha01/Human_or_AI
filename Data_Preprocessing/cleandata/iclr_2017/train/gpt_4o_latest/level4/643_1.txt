The authors introduce a straightforward modification to online dictionary learning by incorporating steps inspired by neurogenesis. Specifically, they propose adding mechanisms for atom addition and deletion to extend the online dictionary learning algorithm of Mairal et al. These modifications enable the dictionary to better adapt to the evolving properties of the data.
The proposed online adaptation is intriguing, albeit relatively simple. While the overall algorithm appears reasonable, certain aspects are not described in sufficient detail. For instance, the thresholds or criteria governing the addition or removal of atoms lack robust analytical justification, though the algorithm demonstrates strong performance in the extensive experiments presented.
Despite not being entirely novel, the core idea is compelling, and the paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. However, the analysis remains somewhat superficial. A deeper investigation into the evolving characteristics of the dictionary, its ability to track changes in the data, and its overall accuracy would have been valuable additions.
That said, this is still a commendable piece of work!
