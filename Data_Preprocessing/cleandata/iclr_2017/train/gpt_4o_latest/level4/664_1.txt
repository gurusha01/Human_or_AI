This paper presents an intriguing application of the GAN framework within the steganography domain. Beyond the standard GAN discriminator, the authors introduce a steganalyser discriminator, which is tasked with distinguishing between negative examples from the generator and positive examples from generator-produced images containing a hidden payload. Consequently, the generator not only learns to produce realistic images by deceiving the GAN discriminator but also evolves into a secure container by successfully misleading the steganalyser discriminator. The proposed approach is evaluated by training an independent steganalyser, S*, on both real and generated images.
Considering that the ICLR community is not broadly familiar with steganography literature, I believe this paper would benefit from providing additional context. Specifically, it should clarify how this method could be practically applied, discuss related works on steganalysis-secure message embedding, and include a more comprehensive set of experiments across multiple datasets.
The proposed SGAN framework (Figure 2) appears logical and seems to have a broad applicability beyond the steganography domain. However, it is unclear why deceiving the steganalyser discriminator, S, would necessarily imply the ability to mislead an independent discriminator, S*.
Additionally, I find it surprising that varying the seed value can result in such significant differences in accuracy.
In summary, while the ideas presented in this paper are interesting and hold potential utility, the paper's presentation needs improvement to better align with the expectations of the ICLR and broader machine learning community.
