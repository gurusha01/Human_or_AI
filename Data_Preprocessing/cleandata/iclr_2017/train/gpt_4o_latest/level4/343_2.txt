The authors introduce a novel approach to language modeling that involves first generating a program from a domain-specific language (DSL) and then learning the program's count-based parameters.  
Pros:  
The proposed method is both innovative and distinct from the commonly used LSTM-based approaches in recent literature. Additionally, the model is expected to be significantly faster during query execution. The authors present strong empirical results for code modeling, although there remains a performance gap between the synthesis-based approach and neural methods on the Hutter task. The paper also includes a thorough explanation of the language's syntax.  
Cons/Suggestions:  
- The MCMC-based synthesis procedure is described in a vague manner, despite its efficiency being a central concern for the proposed approach.  
- The paper builds upon prior work from the programming languages (PL) community, but the related work section could be expanded to better contextualize this research within that body of literature.  
- Providing more concise and compelling examples of human interpretability would strengthen the paper.  
Other Comments:  
- Table 1's training time evaluation should include essential details, such as whether training was performed on a GPU or CPU, along with the specifications of the hardware used.
