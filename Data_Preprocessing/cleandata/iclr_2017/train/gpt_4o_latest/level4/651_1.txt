The proposed regularizer appears to be a specific amalgamation of established approaches. While the suggested link between nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers is thought-provoking, I believe the empirical results fail to surpass the performance of comparable methods by a sufficiently significant margin to draw a definitive conclusion.
