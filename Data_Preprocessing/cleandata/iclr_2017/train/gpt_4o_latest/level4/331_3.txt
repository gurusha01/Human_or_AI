The paper addresses the challenge of transferring skills between robots with differing morphologies in the context of agents performing multiple tasks. A key element of the proposed methodology is the use of a task-invariant future space, which is designed to be shared across both tasks and agents.
Relative to prior work (Ammar et al., 2015), the primary contribution appears to be the assumption that "good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment" (Sec. 2). This is an intriguing hypothesis. The approach also bears similarities to the work of Raimalwala et al. (2016), though the authors contend that their method is better suited to handling non-linear dynamics. While these are compelling hypotheses, they do not seem to be fully substantiated by the empirical results presented. In particular, the issue of pairing correspondence is critical. It is unclear what happens when the time alignment assumption fails. Could methods such as dynamic time warping (or similar techniques) yield reasonable outcomes in such cases? The robustness of the approach to inaccuracies in the pairing correspondence P appears to be a significant concern.
More broadly, additional comparisons to other transfer methods, including those mentioned in Sec. 2, would enhance the paper. While the inclusion of Sec. 5.1 is a step in the right direction, it only scratches the surface of the extensive body of recent work on transfer learning. Although different methods may transfer different types of information (e.g., policies), it would be valuable to explore not only how to perform the transfer but also what aspects are most beneficial to transfer in order to achieve better performance.
In summary, the paper addresses an important and timely problem in a highly active research domain. The proposed method of transferring representations is well-motivated, clearly articulated, and conceptually sound. However, the reliance on time alignment for state pairing is a potentially problematic assumption that warrants further validation.
