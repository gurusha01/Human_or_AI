This paper presents a novel approach to reinforcement learning and control that leverages a metacontroller, which operates alongside a base-level controller and several auxiliary "experts," rather than relying on a single controller to perform a task. The metacontroller's role is to determine how many times to invoke the controller and experts, as well as which expert to call at each iteration. Notably, the controller is distinct in that it receives not only the current state but also a summary of the history of prior calls to itself and the experts. The sequence of control actions and expert advice is encoded into a fixed-size vector using an LSTM. The proposed method is evaluated on an N-body control task, demonstrating that iterative reasoning ("pondering") provides benefits even with simple experts, and that the metacontroller achieves improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to fixed-iteration controls.
The paper is generally well written and relatively easy to understand. While the authors acknowledge that the concept of metareasoning has been explored in AI, its integration as a differentiable and fully trainable component within an RL framework appears to be novel. At this stage, it is challenging to assess the broader impact of this approach: the overall model architecture is compelling and likely warrants publication, but its scalability to other domains remains an open question for future investigation. The experimental results are interesting and well-executed, though their scope is somewhat limited. Additionally, given the complexity of the proposed architecture, the paper would benefit from a discussion of any training challenges or convergence issues encountered.
Below are several specific comments, questions, and suggestions:
1) In Figure 1A, the graphical notation should be clarified. For instance, the meaning of arrows with varying thicknesses and line styles is unclear—do these represent different types of relationships or processes?
2) In Figure 3, the caption could better describe the figure's content. For example, it is unclear what the colors of the lines represent. Additionally, in the top row, dots and error bars are shown, but their explanation is provided only in the "bottom row" section, making the figure harder to interpret.
3) In Figure 4, the shaded region represents a 95% confidence interval for the regression line. It would be helpful to also include the standard error of the regression slope (to confirm its significance by verifying that it excludes zero) and the fraction of explained variance (R²).
4) In Figure 5, the fraction of samples utilizing the MLP expert does not appear to decrease monotonically as the cost of the MLP expert increases (e.g., in the bottom-left section of the right plot, with some red-shaded boxes). Could this be due to high variance across experiments? Clarification would be helpful.
5) The supplementary materials are highly informative and much appreciated. Thank you for providing these detailed explanations.
