The paper introduces a method that integrates deep learning-based input-output training with search techniques to align program inputs with specified outputs. Significant speedups compared to non-augmented baselines are demonstrated.
Summary:  
———  
The proposed approach for discovering source code implementations within a relatively small domain-specific language (DSL) is intriguing, though somewhat anticipated.
Quality: The manuscript is well-written.  
Clarity: While the primary narrative is effectively conveyed, certain derivations and underlying intuitions could benefit from more detailed explanations.  
Originality: The concept of leveraging neural networks to accelerate search-based techniques is entirely reasonable.  
Significance: Although the experiments are confined to smaller scales, the demonstrated performance gains are evident.

1. The test set comprises only 100 programs, which appears limited. Additionally, the authors claim that the test set programs are semantically disjoint from the training set. Could the authors elaborate on the rationale behind the small test set size and clarify how the disjoint property is maintained?  
2. The programs under consideration are relatively short. A more comprehensive ablation study focusing on runtime analysis would be beneficial. It seems likely that the search-based procedure remains the most computationally intensive component, with the neural network serving primarily to provide prior information rather than addressing the core task directly.
