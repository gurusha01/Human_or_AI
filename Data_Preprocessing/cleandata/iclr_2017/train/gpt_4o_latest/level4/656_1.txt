In this paper, the authors integrate a geometrical structure into a CNN by combining it with a Scattering network. This approach enhances stability and performance in limited-data settings. The paper is well-written, the contribution of merging Scattering networks with CNNs is novel, and the results appear promising. This work fills a gap in the Scattering literature, making it more applicable to practical scenarios.
I would have liked to see the authors explore the impact of stable lower layers on adversarial robustness. This could be investigated relatively easily using tools such as cleverhans [1] or deep fool [2]. It would be particularly intriguing if the stability of the first layer in these hybrid architectures significantly improves robustness, as this might suggest that adversarial examples are tied to low-level geometrical features. Conversely, if no such improvement is observed, that finding would also be noteworthy.
Additionally, the proposed architecture has not been tested on real-world limited-data problems, which would further substantiate the claim of improved generalization. That said, the observed performance difference between Cifar-100 and Cifar-10 already provides a promising indication in this direction.
If the authors address either of these two points with additional experiments, I would be willing to raise my score from 6 to 7.
Summary:
+ The paper presents an interesting approach that could be valuable for real-world limited-data scenarios.  
+ The results on limited data are promising.  
- Adversarial robustness is not explored in the experiments.  
- The architecture is not tested on realistic small-data problems.  
Minor:  
- A SOTA ResNet should be added to Table 3, as NiN is somewhat outdated.  
- Typos: "tacke," "developping," "learni."
