Pros:  
- Presents a novel and well-articulated formalism for handling invariance in signals with predefined structure.  
- Demonstrates strong numerical results.  
Cons:  
- Requires the structure to be explicitly defined.  
- The dataset used to represent the set structure is overly simplistic.  
- There is a noticeable disconnect between the extensive (and occasionally intricate) theoretical framework and the numerical experiments. As a result, new readers might find the paper challenging to follow due to the lack of illustrative examples.  
Additionally, from my personal perspective, the paper's topic and content have the potential to be a good fit for a major conference, provided the authors refine and enhance the work further. Therefore, if the paper is not accepted, I would advise against submitting it to a workshop, as many prominent conferences might treat ICLR workshop papers as prior publications, which could pose challenges for future submissions. (This is an issue I have personally encountered before.)
