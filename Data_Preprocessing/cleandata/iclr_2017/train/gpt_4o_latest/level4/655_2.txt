Thank you to the authors for their responses! Unfortunately, the paper remains unsuitable for publication in its current form, so I will maintain my original rating.
This work introduces a transfer learning approach aimed at addressing challenges related to optimization complexity and class imbalance.
My primary concerns are as follows:
1. The paper is difficult to follow due to numerous typos, unconventional phrasing, and inconsistent use of terminology such as "distributed," "transfer learning" (used to mean "fine-tuning"), "softmax" (used to mean "fully-connected"), and "deep learning" (used to mean "base neural network"), among others. As a result, I am still uncertain about some details of the proposed algorithm.
2. The captions for the figures and tables lack sufficient detail, requiring the reader to frequently refer back to the main text to understand the meaning of the presented data and images.
3. Based on my interpretation of Figure 1, the authors appear to define "conventional transfer learning" as fine-tuning only the fully-connected layers. If this is the case, it is critical to include a comparison with scenarios where some convolutional layers are also fine-tuned. This comparison is currently absent from the paper.
Responses to the pre-review questions:
1. Regarding Question 1: If the paper exclusively addresses the case where |C| == |L|, it would be beneficial to simplify the notation to reduce unnecessary complexity.
2. Regarding Question 2: The concept of distributed transfer learning remains unclear. Figure 1 is intended to illustrate the distinction from the conventional approach (fine-tuning fully-connected layers only). However, the diagram suggests that the base CNN has an identical number of convolutional filters at each layer and that, for some reason, filters with the same indices are connected to form a distributed ensemble. This approach is not intuitive to me, though I may be misunderstanding the figure. I recommend revising the diagram to clarify the intended methodology.
In summary, the paper requires substantial improvements to enhance its clarity and presentation. As it stands, it is not suitable for acceptance.
