This paper integrates variational RNN (VRNN) and domain adversarial networks (DANN) to address domain adaptation within the sequence modeling domain. The VRNN is employed to learn representations for sequential data, specifically the hidden states at the final time step. Meanwhile, the DANN is utilized to render these representations domain-invariant, thereby enabling cross-domain adaptation.
The authors conduct experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method (VRADA) consistently outperforms baseline approaches, including DANN, VFAE, and R-DANN, on the majority of benchmarks.
I do not have concerns regarding the proposed model itself; the approach is well-explained and appears to be a straightforward combination of VRNN and DANN. However, a few questions arose during the pre-review question phase:
- As noted by the authors, DANN generally outperforms methods based on MMD regularization. However, the VFAE method, which employs MMD regularization on the learned representations, seems to outperform DANN across the board. This observation suggests that combining VRNN with MMD could also yield promising results.
- One of the baselines included in the experiments is R-DANN, an RNN-based variant of DANN. There are two key differences between R-DANN and VRADA: (1) R-DANN employs a deterministic RNN for representation learning, whereas VRADA uses a variational RNN; (2) in the target domain, R-DANN optimizes only the adversarial loss, while VRADA jointly optimizes the adversarial loss and reconstruction loss during feature learning. It would be valuable to further analyze which of these differences contributes most significantly to the observed performance improvements.
