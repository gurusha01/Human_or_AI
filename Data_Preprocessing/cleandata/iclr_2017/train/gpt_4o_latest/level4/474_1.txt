After the discussion below, I revisited the authors' prior work (MUS-ROVER), which forms the foundation of this paper. On the one hand, this prior work was instrumental in helping me better comprehend the current submission. On the other hand, it was essential for me to consult it in order to fully understand the current paper.
Overall, while I find this work interesting and am familiar with the JSB chorales, probabilistic methods, n-grams, and related topics, I struggled to follow the paper in several sections. The heavy reliance on notation, in particular, detracted from the clarity of the presentation.
I believe the ideas and methodologies presented are strong and certainly worth publishing and further exploration. However, I am not convinced that the paper, in its current form, is a good fit for ICLR. (To clarify, my concern is not with the application itself—music-related applications can be highly appropriate—nor necessarily with the approach itself, as I elaborate below.) My impression is that a long-form journal article would provide the authors with the space needed to fully articulate their ideas, include clearer running examples where necessary, offer sufficient background for the intended audience, provide a more comprehensive explanation of the prior system, and potentially demonstrate results on an additional dataset to establish the generality of the approach. The constraints of a short conference paper seem to compress this project into a format that does not do it justice. If the authors could focus on a single aspect of the system, that might work, but I do not have specific recommendations for how to achieve this within the current page limits.
If the paper were to undergo substantial revision (though I cannot suggest specific ways to achieve this within the page constraints), I would consider increasing my score. However, I believe the authors' efforts might be better directed toward transforming this work into a longer, more detailed journal submission.
[Addendum: Based on discussions and revisions, I have updated my score.]
Do you have any insights into what is happening in the bottom row ("5-gram") of the top section of Figure 4?
I am also curious about how well the proposed approach might scale. Certain components appear to rely on exhaustive searches or enumerations, but this was not entirely clear. For instance, consider a scenario where the system is adapted to assist students in learning orchestration, which could involve 10–20 instruments. In this case, the family of windows in Eq(1) would correspond to a significantly larger power set. Additionally, orchestration pieces tend to be much longer, making the counting of occurrences of arbitrary compositions of atomic operators potentially combinatorially challenging. That said, conceptually organizing orchestration rules hierarchically could be a very promising application. Any comments on this scalability issue would be appreciated.
