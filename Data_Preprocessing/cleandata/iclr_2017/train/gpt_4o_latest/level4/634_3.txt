This paper introduces a relatively novel approach for visualizing the features or hidden units of a neural network and generating adversarial examples. The proposed method involves performing gradient descent in the pixel space, starting from a given hidden unit in any layer. This can be achieved either by selecting a pair of images and optimizing over the difference in activations of the unit or by directly optimizing the activation of the unit for a single image. Overall, the method appears intriguing, and I provide the following comments:
Some of the claims at the beginning of Sec 4.1 regarding positive/negative signs and their effect (or lack thereof) on the class are unclear. From a mathematical perspective, I do not see why these claims would necessarily hold. Additionally, the contradictory results observed between MNIST and face datasets seem to align with my intuition on this matter.
The authors rely on the PASS score throughout the paper but only provide an intuition and a citation for it. It would be helpful to include a brief explanation—one or two sentences—about what the PASS score actually measures.
While the PASS score shows some degree of correlation with L2, L\{infty}, or visual assessments of the quality of adversarial examples, the correlation is not complete. It remains unclear what the key takeaway is from the various metrics presented.
The statement in Sec 5.2 that "LOTS cannot produce high-quality adversarial examples at the lower layers" seems incorrect for the MNIST dataset, does it not?
I would have appreciated the inclusion of more quantitative results in this work. For instance, the authors could extract adversarial examples from different layers, add them to the training set, retrain the networks, and compare performance on the test set. This would complement the visualizations provided and address what I see as the primary limitation of the paper. Additionally, the lack of comparisons with other methods makes it difficult to evaluate the merits of this work in isolation.

EDIT after rebuttal: I appreciate the authors' efforts in addressing the concerns regarding experimental validation. These additions make the paper more compelling, and I have revised my score accordingly.
