The authors investigate trained neural networks by quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons for various features, such as color and category.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and includes clear, informative figures.
- The authors have executed their stated objective competently from a technical perspective. For example, the indices they employ appear to be thoughtfully chosen for their intended purposes.
Weaknesses:
- I must acknowledge a personal bias against the overarching premise of this paper. I find the motivation behind the work lacking and believe it offers little in terms of meaningful insights. In essence, the authors have compiled and summarized a collection of isolated observations about neural network behavior without providing a compelling reason to consider these specific findings significant. This approach reminds me of a common issue in neurophysiology research, where selectivity distributions of neurons for various properties are cataloged without further context or justification for their importance. Similarly, I do not find the current "virtual electrophysiology" approach to neural networks particularly useful. Why should we care about the distribution of color selectivities? How does documenting such distributions contribute to "understanding"? In my view, it does not—at least not in any direct or actionable way.
Suggestions for Improvement:
(a) From a neuroscience perspective: The authors could have compared the properties they measured in their models to analogous properties observed in biological neurons. Demonstrating that certain models align more closely with real neural data than others would be a significant and valuable contribution. In other words, while isolated catalogs of selectivities from both models and biological neurons may seem uninformative on their own, identifying correspondences (or discrepancies) between the two could lead to meaningful insights. Such comparisons would not only enhance our understanding of neural networks but also complement existing research that seeks to draw parallels between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and visual brain areas. While obtaining high-quality neural data is undoubtedly challenging, the results of such an analysis—whether positive or negative—would be inherently interesting.
(b) From an artificial intelligence perspective: The authors could have demonstrated that their proposed metrics serve as prescriptive constraints. For instance, they could have tested whether enforcing the specific color and category selectivity indices they compute as loss-function criteria during training leads to the development of useful filters and significantly improved performance on the original task. Such a result would be highly impactful, as it would provide a concrete reason to care about the metrics they chose and contribute to the broader effort of identifying unsupervised or semi-supervised learning strategies. These metrics, being computable from relatively small datasets or high-level semantic labels, could offer practical advantages. Conversely, if such constraints were shown to have no effect on performance, it would suggest that the measured properties are epiphenomenal and do not meaningfully contribute to the network's ability to solve perceptual tasks. This would parallel similar concerns in neurophysiology, where certain observed properties may lack functional relevance.
[Note: I have personally explored similar ideas in the past, testing whether high-level statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) that seem "interesting"—e.g., correlations with complexity or differences across layers—can serve as optimization constraints. Unfortunately, I have consistently found that these properties fail to improve performance on challenging tasks like ImageNet. While I have not specifically tested the metrics proposed in this paper, my experience leads me to doubt their practical utility.]
I recognize that these suggestions are ambitious and challenging to implement. However, without such efforts, this work feels like a step backward for the field, diverting attention from more impactful directions.
