This paper introduces a modification to the parametric texture synthesis model proposed by Gatys et al., incorporating long-range correlations in textures. To achieve this, the authors augment the synthesis loss by including Gram matrices computed between spatially shifted feature vectors. Some of the textures generated using this approach exhibit visual improvements over the original method by Gatys et al., particularly for textures with pronounced structured long-range correlations (e.g., bricks).
The manuscript is well-written, with the methodology and underlying intuitions clearly presented. The authors also conduct a diverse set of synthesis experiments across various textures, which strengthens the evaluation of their approach.
My primary concern, which applies to all methods in this category, including Gatys et al., is the variability of the generated samples. The global minimum of the proposed objective function remains the original image itself. This limitation is partially addressed through inpainting experiments, where the synthesized regions are required to align coherently with the borders (as demonstrated by the authors). However, the paper does not provide additional insights into this issue, which would have been a valuable contribution.
Overall, this work represents a straightforward and effective modification of the Gatys et al. method. While it does not constitute a major breakthrough, it is a solid contribution that merits publication.
