This paper introduces Submodular Sum Product Networks (SSPNs) along with an efficient inference algorithm designed to approximately compute the most probable labeling of variables within the model. The primary application explored in the paper is scene parsing. Within this framework, SSPNs define an energy function that incorporates a grammar component to represent a hierarchy of labels and a Markov Random Field (MRF) to enforce label smoothness over spatial regions. For inference, the authors propose a move-making algorithm inspired by the concept of fusion moves (Lempitsky et al., 2010). This algorithm iteratively refines a solution by exploring a large neighborhood of alternative segmentations and solving an optimization problem to select the best candidate. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves lower energy values compared to belief propagation and alpha expansion while being significantly faster.
Overall, this is a well-executed paper. The proposed model is novel and clearly articulated, and the algorithm is presented with thorough analysis, including runtime considerations and guarantees on its behavior. The algorithm appears effective in minimizing the energy of SSPN models.
However, I believe this paper is not an ideal fit for ICLR. The model's design seems somewhat contrary to the core theme of learning representations, as it relies on a highly structured, hand-crafted energy function defined by the human modeler, followed by inference. The connection to representation learning is not evident. Another concern is that, while the proposed algorithm is faster than existing alternatives, its runtime—ranging from 1 to 287 seconds per image—limits its practical applicability, particularly for tasks like training convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
Additionally, the paper does not provide evidence that the proposed model produces superior segmentations compared to alternative models. The evaluations focus solely on energy values and are conducted on the training data, without addressing segmentation quality.
In conclusion, while this is a strong paper that deserves to be published at a reputable machine learning conference, I do not believe ICLR is the appropriate venue for it.
