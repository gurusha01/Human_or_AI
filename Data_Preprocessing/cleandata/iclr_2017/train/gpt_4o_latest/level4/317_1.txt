The paper introduces a novel framework for addressing the SR problem through amortized MAP inference and incorporates a pre-trained affine projection layer to ensure consistency with LR outputs. Additionally, it proposes three distinct approaches to minimize cross-entropy. Overall, this is an excellent paper. However, I have several comments:
1) The proposed amortized MAP inference is innovative and distinct from prior SR methods. When combined with GAN, this framework achieves plausible and high-quality results. However, in comparison to another GAN-based SR method—Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network—questions may arise regarding the specific contributions of this new formulation to the current state-of-the-art.
2) By employing an affine projection architecture as a constraint, the model eliminates the need for corresponding {HR, LR} image pairs during training. However, the training of the affine projection layer itself still requires {HR, LR} image pairs. Does this imply that the training requirement has simply been shifted to the affine projection layer?
3) The paper provides extensive results for the framework, including those on natural images from ImageNet. Could the authors also include results on conventional SR test datasets, such as Set5, Set14, or BSD100, to enable a fair comparison with prior work?
4) The results presented in the paper for natural images are limited to a resolution of 128×128. Can this framework handle larger image sizes effectively? This is particularly important since SR often involves inputs of arbitrary sizes.
5) Standard GANs typically include a noise term as part of the latent space, which helps model a distribution more effectively. Did the authors experiment with incorporating a noise vector?
In summary, this paper introduces a novel SR framework supported by strong theoretical analysis. The ideas are creative, and the authors explore multiple methods. However, there remain open questions regarding necessity and additional experiments that could strengthen the work. Nonetheless, I believe this paper will serve as a valuable source of inspiration for the research community.
