The paper introduces an action-conditional recurrent network designed to predict video game frames hundreds of steps into the future. The authors highlight three primary contributions:  
1. a modification to the model architecture (based on Oh et al.) by incorporating the action at time t-1 to directly predict the hidden state at time t,  
2. an exploration of jumpy predictions (predicting multiple future frames without relying on intermediate frames), and  
3. an investigation of different training schemes (balancing observation and prediction frames during LSTM training).  
1. Modification to Model Architecture  
Strengths:  
+ The motivation for this modification is well-founded, as prior work (Oh et al.) allows the action at t-1 to influence xt but not the LSTM state ht. The proposed approach addresses this by making ht dependent on a{t-1}.  
Weaknesses:  
- The technical novelty of this modification is limited. As noted in reviewer questions, a similar effect could be achieved by including at-1 as an input to the LSTM at time t without altering the LSTM architecture. While the authors argue that combining at-1 with ht-1 and st-1 performs worse than their current method (which combines at-1 only with ht-1), empirical comparisons for combining at-1 only with st-1 or only with h_t-1 are missing. A stronger justification for the proposed formulation is needed.  
- The experimental analysis of this architectural change is insufficient. Fig. 5(a) compares the proposed method with Oh et al., but the performance difference includes two factors: the training scheme and the architecture. The specific contribution of the architecture is unclear from this experiment. While the authors reference Fig. 12(a) to isolate the architecture's impact for "Seaquest," the observed gain at 100 steps (~15) is only a small fraction of the overall improvement in Fig. 5(a) (~90). This makes it challenging to assess the significance of the architectural modification, especially since the analysis is limited to one game.  
2. Exploring the Idea of Jumpy Predictions  
Strengths:  
+ The authors correctly note that skipping intermediate frames during future frame prediction could significantly speed up simulations.  
+ The results in Fig. 5(b) reveal interesting insights, showing that omitting intermediate frames does not substantially increase error for at least some games.  
Weaknesses:  
- It is unclear whether this effect is a result of the proposed model or if it could also be achieved using prior models like Oh et al.  
- While the observations are intriguing, a more detailed analysis across a broader range of games would strengthen the findings. Additionally, the novelty of skipping intermediate frames for speedup is minimal.  
3. Exploring Different Training Schemes  
Strengths:  
+ This is arguably the most compelling contribution of the paper. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the impact of varying training schemes, specifically the balance between observation and prediction frames during training.  
+ The results demonstrate that this adjustment in training can significantly influence prediction performance and is the primary driver of improvement over Oh et al.  
Weaknesses:  
- Although this observation is interesting, similar effects have been extensively studied in prior work, such as scheduled sampling (Bengio et al.) and, to some extent, in Oh et al.  
Clarity of Presentation  
Weaknesses:  
- The experimental setup is not clearly described for certain results. For example, the paper does not explicitly state that Fig. 2(a) uses the same architecture as Oh et al., though this was clarified in the response to reviewer questions.  
- Fig. 4 is difficult to interpret. The qualitative differences between Oh et al. and the proposed method should be explicitly highlighted.  
- Minor: The qualitative analysis section requires readers to navigate multiple video links, disrupting the flow of reading, especially for printed copies.  
Overall Assessment  
The paper presents some intriguing experimental observations. However, the technical novelty and the specific contributions of the proposed architecture and training scheme remain unclear.
