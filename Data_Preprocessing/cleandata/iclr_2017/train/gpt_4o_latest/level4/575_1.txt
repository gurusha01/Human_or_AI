The contribution of this paper is unclear to me. Deep CCA (Andrew et al., 2013) already provides the gradient derivation of the correlation objective with respect to the network outputs, which are subsequently back-propagated to update the network weights. Similarly, this paper derives the gradient of the correlation (i.e., the CCA objective) with respect to the network outputs, making it unclear what the authors mean when they claim that their differentiable version allows direct back-propagation through the computation of CCA.
