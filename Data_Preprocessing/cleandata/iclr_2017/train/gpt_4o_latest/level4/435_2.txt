This paper presents an intriguing exploration of learning rate schedules, incorporating the concept of restarts, which is frequently underappreciated in deep learning. The study is conducted on non-trivial datasets, and although the findings are not entirely definitive, the results are highly promising. The novelty of the approach justifies its acceptance for publication.
I appreciate the authors' efforts in addressing my earlier concerns during the revision process.
