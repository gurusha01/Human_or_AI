This paper presents an analytical performance model designed to estimate the training and evaluation time of a given network across various software, hardware, and communication strategies.  
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors incorporated significant flexibility in the variables used to calculate the runtime of a network, including the number of workers, bandwidth, platform, and parallelization strategy. Their results align well with those reported in the existing literature.  
Additionally, their code is open-source, and the live demo is promising.  
The authors noted in their comments that future updates to the interface will allow users to upload customized networks and model splits, which could greatly enhance the tool's utility.  
It would also be valuable to see the inclusion of more recent network architectures with skip connections, such as ResNet and DenseNet.
