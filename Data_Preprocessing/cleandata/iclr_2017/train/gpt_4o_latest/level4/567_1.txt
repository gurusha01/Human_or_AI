This paper introduces a multiview learning framework aimed at identifying dependent subspaces by optimizing cross-view similarity within the neighborhoods of data samples. The motivation for this work stems from applications in information retrieval. The authors position their approach as an alternative to CCA-based multiview learning methods; however, it is worth noting that CCA-based techniques serve a fundamentally different purpose and are generally more broadly applicable than the specific setting addressed in this paper. Key points:
- The authors' discussion of time complexity is unclear. It seems they are merely reporting the computational cost of evaluating the objective in equation (7). Is there any insight into the number of iterations required by the L-BFGS method? While this may be challenging to estimate given the nature of the optimization problem, it would be helpful to provide a practical sense of how difficult or straightforward it is to optimize the objective in (7) and how this effort scales with different problem dimensions. Although the authors argue that scalability is not their primary focus, if computational cost is mentioned, it should be clarified that the reported cost pertains to a specific component of their approach rather than representing the overall "time complexity."
- Since the authors present their method as an alternative to CCA, they should explicitly address how CCA, despite being a nonconvex optimization problem, can be solved exactly with computational complexity that is linear in the data size and only quadratic in dimensionality, even with a straightforward implementation. In contrast, the proposed method does not appear to be immediately tractable. This distinction warrants further discussion.
- The empirical results on synthetic data are somewhat perplexing. The data generation process is unnecessarily complexâ€”processing each coordinate separately in different groups, followed by permutation and combination, seems overly intricate. A simpler benchmark, such as applying distinct linear transformations to a shared representation and adding independent noise, would suffice to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, it is puzzling why CCA fails to recover the true subspace. The level of additive noise should influence recoverability, yet the proposed method achieves near-exact results, suggesting the noise level may not be particularly severe. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the authors applied regularization to CCA. Without regularization, CCA can exhibit erratic behavior. This point requires clarification.
