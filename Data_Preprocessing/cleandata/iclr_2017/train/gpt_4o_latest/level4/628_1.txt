The paper explores submodular sum-product networks as a tractable extension of classical sum-product networks. The proposed method is tested on semantic segmentation tasks, and some initial promising results are presented.
Summary:
———
The paper introduces an interesting technique for hierarchical reasoning in MRFs, but the experimental results are not yet compelling. Additionally, the writing is occasionally unclear. See below for detailed feedback.
Quality: Some of the techniques could be explained more thoroughly to improve the intuition behind them.  
Clarity: Certain derivations and conceptual explanations require more elaboration.  
Originality: The proposed idea is innovative.  
Significance: Due to the limited experimental setup, it is difficult to fully assess the significance of the work at this stage.

1. The paper's clarity could be greatly improved by addressing inaccuracies. For example, \(\alpha\)-expansion and belief propagation are not "scene-understanding algorithms" but rather methods for optimizing energy functions. The claim that the MAP state of an SSPN can be computed in sub-linear time relative to the network size seems counterintuitive, as it implies not visiting all nodes in the network. The term "deep probabilistic model" should be explicitly defined. Additionally, the statement that InferSSPN computes "the approximate MAP state of the SSPN (equivalently, the optimal parse of the image)" raises questions about how an "approximate MAP state" can be considered optimal. These and other inaccuracies should be clarified.
2. Although the method is framed for scene understanding tasks, the paper does not provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A more comprehensive analysis is necessary to evaluate its applicability. Specifically, the technique is tested on a limited subset of images, making it impossible to compare the results with other approaches. In my opinion, the paper should either include a thorough experimental evaluation using metrics such as IoU or provide comparisons to publicly available benchmarks.
3. To enhance the paper's accessibility, a more intuitive high-level explanation of the approach would be helpful. The authors might also consider including a visualization to provide a clearer understanding of their method.
