Paper tackles systematic discrepancies between simulated and real-world policy control domains. The proposed method introduces two key ideas: 1) employing adversarial training on an ensemble of models to develop policies resilient to inaccuracies and 2) adapting the source domain ensemble using data from the (real-world) target domain.
> Significance
The paper addresses an important and impactful problem, and the approach proposed is both innovative and compelling.
> Clarity
The paper is well-written but assumes a certain level of domain expertise for full comprehension.
My primary concerns were effectively resolved through the rebuttal and subsequent revisions to the paper.
