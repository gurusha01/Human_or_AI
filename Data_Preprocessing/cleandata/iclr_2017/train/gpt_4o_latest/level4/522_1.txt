The paper conducts a convergence analysis of certain two-layer neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activations. While this is not the first study of its kind, the work may offer novelty in the assumptions employed during the analysis and its emphasis on the ReLU nonlinearity, which is widely used in practice.
The manuscript is somewhat difficult to follow due to numerous grammatical errors and typographical issues. Despite these challenges, the analysis appears to be largely correct. However, the novelty and key insights are not consistently well-motivated or clearly articulated. Additionally, the claim that the work adopts more realistic assumptions (e.g., Gaussian inputs) compared to prior studies is rather contentious.
In summary, the paper provides a seemingly valid analysis, but its presentation and writing are far from optimal. Furthermore, the clarity regarding the novelty and significance of the results is lacking. To enhance the paper's impact and accessibility, the main results and underlying intuition should be presented more clearly, with technical details relegated to the appendices. This restructuring would likely improve the visibility and influence of the otherwise interesting findings.
