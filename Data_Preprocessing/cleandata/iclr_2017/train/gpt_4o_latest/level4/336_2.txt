Review  
This paper introduces five modifications aimed at enhancing PixelCNN, a generative model with tractable likelihood. The authors demonstrate the impact of each proposed modification through a series of ablation studies and report a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10. Improving generative models for images is a highly active area of research, and this work makes a meaningful contribution to the field.
Pros  
The authors provide clear and well-motivated explanations for each of their proposed modifications. They also validate the importance of each modification through ablation experiments.
One notable contribution is the use of a discretized mixture of logistic distributions to model the conditional distribution of a sub-pixel, replacing the 256-way softmax. This approach reduces the output dimensionality and better captures the ordinal relationships between sub-pixel values. Additionally, the authors report that this modification accelerates both training time (due to reduced computation) and convergence during model optimization, as illustrated in Fig. 6.
Another interesting insight provided by the authors is their observation that the dependencies between the color channels of a pixel are relatively simple and do not necessitate a deep network for modeling. This insight enables a streamlined architecture where feature maps do not need to be divided into three separate groups based on their visibility of the R/G/B sub-pixels at the current location.
Cons  
The paper does not clearly explain the predictive distribution for the green and blue channels. Specifically, it is unclear how the means of the mixture components depend linearly on the value of the red sub-pixel. Including explicit equations for these dependencies would have been helpful.
Minor Comments  
- In Fig. 2, the caption states "Sequence of 6 layers," but the text in Section 2.4 refers to "6 blocks of 5 ResNet layers." What does the remaining layer correspond to?  
- In Fig. 2, what does the first "green square -> blue square" outside the white rectangle represent?  
- Is there a specific reason why the mixture indicator is shared across all three channels?
