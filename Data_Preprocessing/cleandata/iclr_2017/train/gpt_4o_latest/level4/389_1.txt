The paper introduces a novel SampleRNN designed to directly model waveform signals, demonstrating superior performance in both objective test NLL and subjective A/B evaluations.
However, as highlighted in the discussion section, the current version of the paper lacks sufficient detail in describing the proposed model. It is expected that this issue will be addressed in the final submission.
While the authors attempted to compare their approach with the WaveNet model, they were unable to surpass the baseline LSTM-RNN, which undermines the persuasiveness of the comparisons to WaveNet. Therefore, rather than allocating time and space to comparisons with WaveNet, it would be more beneficial to focus on providing a more detailed explanation of the proposed model.
