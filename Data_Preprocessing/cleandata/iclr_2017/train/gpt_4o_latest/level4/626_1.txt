Summary:  
This paper investigates the structure of the preimage corresponding to a specific activity at a hidden layer of a neural network. It demonstrates that the preimage of any given activity forms a piecewise linear arrangement of subspaces.
Pros:  
Understanding the geometry of preimages associated with specific activity vectors could significantly enhance our comprehension of neural networks.
Cons:  
The analysis appears to be in an early stage, offering neither novel theoretical insights nor concrete practical implications.  
The primary theoretical takeaway seems to be that the preimage is composed of a patchwork of lower-dimensional subspaces. Could a more direct inductive approach have been applied (e.g., tracing backward from the penultimate layer)? This is certainly a promising line of inquiry, and it would be valuable to see further exploration in this area (e.g., examining how factors like network depth or width influence the partitioning of space, or how these structures evolve during training). However, the work does not yet seem fully developed.
