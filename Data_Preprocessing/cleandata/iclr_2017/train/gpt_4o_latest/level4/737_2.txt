Summary: This paper introduces SqueezeNet, a compact CNN architecture designed for embedded systems. It investigates both macroarchitectural and microarchitectural aspects of CNNs to create SqueezeNet, which is built using fire modules.
Pros:  
The model achieves 50x lower memory usage compared to AlexNet while maintaining comparable accuracy.
Cons & Questions:  
The complex bypass configuration demonstrates lower accuracy than the simple bypass. The simple bypass resembles the ResNet bottleneck structure, while the complex bypass is similar to the inception modules in GoogLeNet. Could these two variants of SqueezeNet be considered adaptations of concepts from GoogLeNet and ResNet? If so, wouldn't it be worth exploring a SqueezeNet-like model that achieves accuracy on par with GoogLeNet and ResNet?
