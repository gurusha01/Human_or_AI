This paper explores the use of GANs for encrypted communications.
In Section 2, the authors introduce a three-part neural network designed to encode and decode data. However, this model lacks practical utility and serves primarily as a precursor to the model described in Section 3. It is demonstrably inferior to any provable cryptographic system.
In Section 3, the authors propose a task aimed at concealing specific parts of the data, which contain correlated fields, while making the rest publicly accessible. Nevertheless, it is challenging to identify a scenario where this approach would outperform a straightforward method of decorrelating the data and encrypting the fields intended for concealment using a provable cryptographic system, while leaving the remaining fields in plain text.
