This paper proposes the concept of fuzzy paraphrases to enhance the learning of distributed word representations by leveraging a corpus enriched with a lexicon or ontology. While polysemy is often context-dependent, previous methods have largely overlooked this aspect when integrating external paraphrase information during training. The core contribution lies in introducing a function that evaluates the context-sensitivity of paraphrase candidates, assigning lower weights to those that are highly context-dependent. This function is derived based on bilingual translation agreement.
The rationale behind the model design is intuitive, and the idea that incorporating high-quality paraphrases while filtering out poor ones during training could improve word representation quality is compelling. However, the key questions are whether the proposed method effectively achieves this goal and, even if it does, whether the improvements are practically significant.
On the first question, I am not entirely persuaded that the parameterization of the control function f(x_ij) is optimal. It would have been beneficial to see experiments exploring alternative parameterizations, particularly baselines where the influence of f is reduced (e.g., where f approaches a constant value of 1). Additionally, incorporating f as a function of nearby word embeddings could potentially yield significant benefits, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. (For reference, see 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al., which should likely be cited.) As presented, the experimental results do not strongly differentiate the fuzzy paraphrase approach from prior methods; for instance, tables 3 and 4 do not exhibit clear trends favoring the proposed method.
On the second question, relying solely on analogy tasks makes it challenging to draw robust conclusions, especially given that factors unrelated to paraphrasing quality—such as corpus size, content, window size, and vocabulary size—can disproportionately influence performance.
In summary, this paper presents a solid and well-motivated idea, but the experimental evidence does not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method achieves its intended objectives. With more thorough experiments and deeper analysis, I would enthusiastically support this paper's acceptance; however, in its current form, I remain undecided.
