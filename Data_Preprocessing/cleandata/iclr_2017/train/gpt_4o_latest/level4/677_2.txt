The authors build upon the skip-graph architecture introduced by Kiros (2015) and adapt it for the task of classifying labeled graphs, specifically molecular graphs. Their approach involves generating numerous sentences by performing random walks on the graph and training the model to predict both the preceding and succeeding parts of a sentence from its middle segment. The activations from the decoder component of this model, derived from a walk on a new graph, are then utilized as features for a binary classifier tasked with predicting whether a molecule exhibits anti-cancer properties.
The paper is generally well-written, though the evaluation section lacks details regarding how the embeddings are employed for the actual classification task (e.g., specifics about the classifier used).
Regrettably, I am not familiar with the dataset or the difficulty of achieving the reported results, which would be a critical factor in assessing the paper's merit for acceptance.
