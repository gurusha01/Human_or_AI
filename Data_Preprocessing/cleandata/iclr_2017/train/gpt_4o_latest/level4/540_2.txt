This paper explores neural network/CNN architecture morphing.  
However, results are not provided for larger ResNet models on ImageNet or for newer architectures like Xception and DenseNet, which might still be relatively recent. Additionally, most of the reported results are based on smaller datasets and networks, limiting confidence in the applicability of this approach to production systems.  
The primary concern is the lack of detailed discussion on the computational time and effort required for these techniques. It is crucial to quantify the additional effort needed to comprehend and implement a new method, particularly when the performance improvements are marginal.
