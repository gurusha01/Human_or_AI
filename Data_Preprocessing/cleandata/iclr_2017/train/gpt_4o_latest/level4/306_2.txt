This paper presents a novel approach to meta-learning by framing the SGD update rule as a gated recurrent model with trainable parameters. The concept is both original and significant for advancing research in transfer learning. While the paper is well-structured, certain sections could benefit from improved clarity.
Pros:
- A compelling and practical approach to meta-learning
- Strong performance with competitive results and thorough comparisons to state-of-the-art methods
- Useful insights and recommendations for real-world systems
Cons:
- The analogy aligns more closely with GRUs than LSTMs
- The explanation of data partitioning into meta sets is difficult to follow and would benefit from visualization
- The experimental evaluation is somewhat incomplete; specifically, analyzing the impact of the parameters \( it \) and \( ft \) would be valuable
- Figure 2 provides limited utility
Remarks:
- Minor typo in Section 3.2: "This means each coordinate has it" should be corrected to "its"
> The authors mention plans to release the code used in their experiments.
This would be a significant advantage.
