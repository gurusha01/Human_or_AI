This paper introduces a method to address supervised multivariate time series tasks with missing values. The core approach involves leveraging recurrent neural networks (specifically GRUs in this study) for sequence-based supervised learning tasks, such as classification, while incorporating modifications to the input and hidden layers of the RNNs to handle the issue of missing data.
Pros:  
1) The idea of leveraging missing values is significant, and the observation of the decaying effect in the healthcare domain is particularly intriguing.  
2) The experiments appear robust, with appropriate baseline algorithms and a thorough analysis of the results.  
Cons:  
1) The novelty of the proposed approach is somewhat limited, as the primary modification involves introducing a decaying smooth factor to the input and hidden layers.  
2) The datasets utilized in this study are relatively small.  
3) The applicability of the decaying effect to other domains may be limited.
