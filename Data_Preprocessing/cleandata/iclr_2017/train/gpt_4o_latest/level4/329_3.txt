The authors propose an approach to enhance the training procedure of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating an additional term derived from denoising autoencoders. The rationale for using denoising autoencoders stems from the observation that they inherently capture the data distribution they are trained on. Although sampling methods based solely on denoising autoencoders have not yet been shown to produce compelling generative models (as no evidence to the contrary has been demonstrated), this paper illustrates that their integration with GANs can be effective.
Overall, I find this paper to be well-written, logically argued, and built upon sound principles. While the idea presented is solid and interesting, it is neither groundbreaking nor a significant departure from prior work. I would have appreciated a more structured experimental section that delves deeper into the comparative merits of various design choices (as outlined in my pre-review questions), rather than focusing primarily on proving the efficacy of a single selected variant.
In addition to this general feedback, I have already raised specific questions and critiques in the pre-review phase, and I appreciate the authors' responses. My primary concern, based on these responses, lies in the validity of the (Alain & Bengio, 2014) intuition regarding denoising autoencoders when operating in a nonlinear feature space. If the behavior of the denoiser function is influenced by the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation Î¦, an important question arises as to whether this dependence can be effectively leveraged by the optimization process.
