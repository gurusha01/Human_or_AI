This paper proposes a method for constructing deep neural networks through systematic rules for expanding and merging sub-networks.  
Strengths:  
- The concept introduced is innovative.  
- The methodology is explained in a clear and comprehensible manner.  
Weaknesses:  
- The experimental results are not sufficiently compelling, as there is no demonstrated improvement on datasets like SVHN.  
- The parameter counts for all models should be reported to enable a fair comparison.  
- The impact of the drop-path technique appears to diminish when data augmentation is applied.
