This paper investigates the perceptual capabilities of a neural network under varying input conditions. The authors achieve this by altering the input image \(x\) in different ways (e.g., downsampling, foveation) and training an autoencoder to reconstruct the original full-resolution image. Both MSE and qualitative results are presented and compared across the different input conditions.
However, the paper appears to lack a clear focus, presenting a collection of preliminary observations with limited concrete conclusions. For instance, at the end of Section 4.4, the authors state: "This result is not surprising, given that FOV-R contains additional information... These results suggest that a small number of foveations containing rich details might be all these neural networks need...". Yet, this hypothesis is left underdeveloped. What specific regions with rich details are necessary, and from which parts of the input? For what types of tasks are these regions critical?
Additionally, it is unclear which reconstruction behaviors stem from the network's fundamental perception of the input and which are artifacts of the autoencoder architecture and the pixelwise \(L2\) loss. A notable example is texture reconstruction, which the autoencoder fails to recover. With a pixelwise loss, the network is forced to predict high-frequency textures almost exactly during training; if this is infeasible, it defaults to generating a pixelwise average of the training samples, resulting in flat regions. Consequently, the network's inability to reconstruct textures may be attributed to challenges in generating them (specifically due to averaging from the training loss) rather than an inherent limitation in perceiving textures. A network trained with a different approach, such as an adversarial loss, might infer the presence of textures even if it cannot reproduce them in a pixelwise \(L2\) sense.
Similarly, the ability to reconstruct color from a color glimpse seems heavily influenced by the network's ability to resolve ambiguities in the input. For example, if there is uncertainty about the color of an object or scene (e.g., a white flower versus a yellow flower), the network may output an average color, leading to sepia tones. However, the paper's discussion on this topic focuses on measuring reconstruction error for varying amounts of color information, without delving deeply into hypotheses about the underlying causes of this behavior.
There are some intriguing findings in the paper, such as the amount of color information required in the foveation to reconstruct a color image and the discussion on global features, which may hint at mechanisms by which glimpses influence the overall reconstruction. However, the overarching takeaways from the paper remain unclear. What are the broader, concrete conclusions that can be drawn from these observations? What mechanisms underlie these findings? A more focused exploration of these questions would significantly strengthen the paper.
