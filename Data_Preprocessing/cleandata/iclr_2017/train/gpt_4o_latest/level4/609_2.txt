I appreciate the authors' responses to my comments. After considering their feedback, I have decided to raise the rating.
This paper introduces a novel variant of the convolution operation designed to accommodate a wide range of graph structures. For each node in the graph, a neighborhood is constructed using a random walk, with neighbors ranked based on their expected number of visits. This process transforms the graph into a feature matrix analogous to the output of MATLAB's/Caffe's im2col function, enabling the convolution operation to be performed as a matrix multiplication.
While the proposed convolution variant appears conceptually sound, I remain unconvinced by the empirical evaluation. The MNIST experiment, in particular, raises concerns. This dataset does not seem well-suited for demonstrating the method's capabilities in this context. To apply their approach to MNIST, the authors discard critical structural information (such as the relative positions of pixels), which artificially increases the problem's complexity. Simultaneously, they compare their method to standard CNNs and report poor performance for their approach, which fails to achieve acceptable accuracy on this dataset.
To justify the inclusion of MNIST (or similar datasets) in the experimental evaluation, the authors should consider adapting their method to incorporate additional graph structure (e.g., relative node positions) in scenarios where the relationships between nodes cannot be fully captured by a similarity matrix.
In its current state, I believe the paper is not yet ready for publication. However, it could be resubmitted to a workshop or another conference after addressing the aforementioned concern.
