This paper introduces a convolutional architecture designed to handle graph-like input data, where the structure varies depending on the example, or more broadly, any data where input dimensions are related through a similarity matrix. In cases where each input example is linked to a transition matrix, the authors propose using a random walk algorithm to derive a similarity matrix.
The development of convolutional or recurrent architectures for graph-like data is indeed a critical area of research, as it enables neural networks to process inputs such as molecular structures or social networks. However, I do not believe this paper offers a significant advancement over existing work in this domain.
The two primary contributions claimed in this paper appear to be:
1) For data associated with a transition matrix, the suggestion to convert the transition matrix into a similarity matrix. This approach seems straightforward and lacks novelty.
2) For data associated with a similarity matrix, the computation of the k nearest neighbors for each node to provide contextual information. Again, this idea appears to be an obvious extension of existing methods.
It is possible that I have misunderstood the intended contribution of the paper, but the lack of clarity in the presentation further complicates its evaluation. As a result, I cannot recommend this paper for publication.
Specific Comments:
1) On page 4: "An interesting attribute of this convolution, as compared to other convolutions on graphs is that, it preserves locality while still being applicable over different graphs with different structures." This statement is inaccurate; existing architectures (e.g., those proposed by Duvenaud et al. and Lusci et al. for neural networks on molecular data) are also capable of handling inputs with varying structures.
