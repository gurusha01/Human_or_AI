I do not consider myself highly qualified to review this paper. My experience with digital logic is limited to what I learned during my university studies. I believe this work would benefit from evaluation by a reviewer with a more advanced background in this field. The research appears to be valuable, and my recommendation would be to consider submitting it to a different venue.
