This paper introduces a novel approach for unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data. The authors propose a recurrent hidden semi-Markov model, which extends traditional hidden semi-Markov models by incorporating a recurrent neural network (RNN) for modeling observations. Each latent class is associated with its own RNN to capture the specific characteristics of observations within that category. Additionally, the paper presents an efficient training procedure based on a variational approximation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world time series data.
This is a compelling and innovative contribution. The proposed approach represents a well-founded integration of duration modeling in HMMs with state-of-the-art observation models leveraging RNNs. This combination addresses the limitations of standard HSMM variants, particularly the simplicity of their emission probability models. The methodology is technically robust and its effectiveness is convincingly demonstrated.
It would be valuable to see a quantitative comparison of this method with CRF-based approaches (e.g., Ammar, Dyer, and Smith, NIPS 2014). While CRFs are capable of modeling more complex data likelihoods, as acknowledged during the response phase, they also have inherent limitations. Nevertheless, the advantages of employing RNNs for class-specific generative models are evident and well-justified.
