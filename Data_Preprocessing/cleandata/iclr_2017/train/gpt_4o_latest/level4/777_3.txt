This paper proposes a maximum total correlation framework, incorporates a target, and subsequently introduces noise perturbations.
Technical Issues:
The transition from equation (1) to equation (2) raises concerns. While equation (2) represents a lower bound, it neglects the term \( H(Z) \), which is problematic because \( H(Z) \) could potentially exhibit greater variability than \( H(Z|Y) \). By omitting \( H(Z) \), the objective in equation (2) implicitly favors \( Z \) with low entropy, as the absence of \( H(Z) \) doubly incentivizes this behaviorâ€”low entropy \( Z \) naturally leads to low entropy \( Z|Y \). Although the inclusion of \(-H(X|Z)\) partially counteracts a complete collapse of \( H(Z) \), it still fails to account for critical terms. This omission raises the question of whether the addition of semantic noise is necessary primarily to artificially increase the entropy of \( Z \), preventing it from diminishing excessively.
In equation (3), arbitrary balancing parameters \( \lambda1 \) and \( \lambda2 \) are introduced without any prior mention or justification. Their sudden appearance lacks explanation.
Subsequently, in equation (5), the objective is further modified by adding \( L_{NLL} \). However, in the supervised setting, the targets are known and should already influence \( H(Z|Y) \). Consequently, \( H(Z|Y) \) ought to be conditioned on the targets. Instead, a new objective is introduced without justification, leaving the conditional entropy of \( Z \) disconnected from the data it is meant to be conditioned on. One might argue that \( C(X, Y, Z) \) serves as a prior over the networks (and implicitly over the weights), which is then combined with a likelihood term, but this interpretation is neither articulated nor supported. Overall, the chosen objective lacks a clear probabilistic or information-theoretic foundation.
Given these foundational issues, it is unsurprising that additional interventions, such as semantic noise addition, are required to make the framework functional. While the specific form of noise addition might have merit, the problematic nature of the underlying objective makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.
Summary: The proposed model requires substantially stronger theoretical justification before any reliable conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the semantic noise modeling.
