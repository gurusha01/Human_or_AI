The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various CNN architectures applied to image retrieval. While the authors focus on exploring different architectural choices, they neither propose nor compare their approach to end-to-end learning frameworks.
From a technical standpoint, the contribution is well-defined, particularly with the insights provided on handling multiple scales in the representation. However, it remains unclear whether there would be any notable differences in the multi-scale setting when considering full versus cropped queries.
Although the paper emphasizes comparisons between different baseline architectures for CNN-based image retrieval, several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of learning end-to-end representations tailored specifically for this task, yielding highly competitive results (e.g., the recent work by Gordo et al., "End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"). The authors argue that their work is complementary to such studies, as they evaluate the performance of networks pre-trained on image classification tasks. They also highlight that image retrieval is inherently more challenging than image classification, given that retrieval relies on features originally optimized for classification. While I can partially accept this reasoning, the superior performance of end-to-end training in recent works raises concerns about the broader applicability of the authors' analysis. It remains unclear whether their findings would extend to or hold relevance in the context of end-to-end training approaches.
