The paper is well-structured and straightforward to understand, with a clear and sensible central idea.  
However, the experimental results are difficult to evaluate, and incorporating additional baselines would enhance the analysis.  
Regarding faster training convergence, it remains unclear how well-tuned the SGD is, as there is no mention of a learning rate schedule.  
Additionally, it would be valuable to validate the approach on other datasets, as the effectiveness of filtering training data might vary depending on the task.
