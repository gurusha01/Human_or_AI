Approximating solutions to PDEs using neural network approximators is a challenging task. This is especially true for HJB and HJI equations, which often have discontinuous and non-differentiable solutions, making them particularly difficult to handle (unless the underlying process involves diffusion, where the Ito term smooths things outâ€”though this paper does not address that case). Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between achieving a small PDE residual and obtaining a well-performing policy [see works by Tsitsiklis, Beard, Todorov, etc., though specific citations are missing]. Significant prior work in this area is not adequately cited.
The use of 2D toy examples is insufficient. What evidence is there to suggest that this approach will scale to solve meaningful, real-world problems?
Additionally, the paper contains several typos (e.g., "Range-Kutta"). 
Most importantly, this paper seems to be submitted to an inappropriate venue. It does not involve learned representations but rather relies on a neural network as a tool. This does not align with the focus of ICLR. A more suitable venue would be ACC, ADPRL, or CDC.
Apologies for the brevity of this review. Despite its critical tone, I am genuinely enthusiastic about this line of research. However, to gain broader recognition, it is crucial to tackle more challenging control problems.
