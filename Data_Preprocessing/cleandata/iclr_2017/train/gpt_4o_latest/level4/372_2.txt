A novel memory module leveraging k-NN is introduced in this paper.  
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, and the results are compelling.  
The use of Omniglot serves as an effective sanity check, with performance that is unexpectedly strong.  
The artificial task demonstrates that the authors' claims are valid and underscores the necessity for improved benchmarks in this area.  
Finally, the translation task provides robust evidence of the proposed model's practical applicability.  
While I am not an expert in memory networks, I trust the authors to verify that all pertinent references have been included (another reviewer pointed out associative LSTM). Other than this, I find the paper to be highly valuable and well-executed. I encourage the authors to release their code.
