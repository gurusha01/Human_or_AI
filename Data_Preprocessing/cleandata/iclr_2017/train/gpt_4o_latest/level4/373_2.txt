Authors' response adequately addressed my concerns. Thank you!  
Evaluation remains unchanged.
This work introduces a hierarchical transfer learning framework for sequence tagging, designed to leverage the source task to benefit the target task by sharing as many levels of representation as feasible. The framework is general and adaptable to various neural architectures. The paper is supported by extensive and robust experiments, demonstrating competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets. The framework is well-articulated, though additional details regarding the training procedure (Section 3.3) would enhance clarity.
The experimental results indicate that for certain task pairs {s, t}, the framework effectively aids the low-resource target task t, with improvements increasing as more representation levels are shared. First, I recommend that the terms source and target be more precisely defined within the framework. As described in Section 3.3, the roles of s and t in each pair appear somewhat interchangeable, as either task could serve as the source or target, especially when task sampling uses p(X=s)=p(X=t)=0.5. The distinction seems to hinge on resource availabilityâ€”one task being low-resourced while the other is not. This raises a key question: does the framework simultaneously benefit both tasks in the pair by learning more generalizable representations across domains/applications/languages, or is the improvement primarily limited to the low-resource task? Additionally, does this come at the expense of performance on the high-resource task?
Second, while the paper demonstrates improvements for low-resource tasks in the selected task pairs, it would be valuable to understand how frequently such improvements occur. Specifically, when tasks are randomly paired (one from a low-resource pool and the other from a high-resource pool), how consistently does this framework benefit the low-resource task?
Furthermore, the selection of T-A/T-B/T-C configurations appears to be guided by the intuition that sharing more levels of representation leads to greater benefits. While this assumption is plausible, it would be insightful to include empirical comparisons. For instance, one could evaluate a cross-domain task pair to determine whether T-A > T-B > T-C holds true, as suggested in the authors' response to the pre-review question.
Overall, this is a strong paper, and there is potential for further exploration in this area. I am inclined to recommend acceptance.
