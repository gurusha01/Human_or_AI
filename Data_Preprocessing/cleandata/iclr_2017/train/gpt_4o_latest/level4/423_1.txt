This paper introduces the concept of incorporating multiple discriminators into GANs. Based on the results, utilizing multiple discriminators appears effective in enhancing stability.
The primary stabilization challenge seems to stem from the gradient signals provided by the discriminator. The authors aim to address this issue by employing multiple discriminators to mitigate its impact.
I find the proposed direction promising. However, I suggest that the authors include additional comparisons with alternative approaches that strengthen discriminator gradients, such as GANs with DAE (Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching), to better highlight the advantages of using multiple discriminators.
