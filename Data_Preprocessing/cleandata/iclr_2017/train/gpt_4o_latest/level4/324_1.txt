The concept of "pruning where it matters" is excellent. The authors have done an impressive job of thoroughly exploring this idea and advancing it further by examining pruning across different layers as well.
Additional credit is due for the clarity of the explanations and the inclusion of well-crafted visuals. Even more credit goes to the explicit specification of the spaces into which the layers are mapped (the use of \mathbb symbols deserves special recognition!).
The experiments are well-executed, and the results are promising. Naturally, more experiments would strengthen the work further, but isn't that always the case?
One question/concern I have is regarding the proposed pruning criterion. While pruning at the filter level is, in my view, the right direction, I am curious about how the "min sum of weights" criterion compares to alternative approaches. How does it stack up against other pruning criteria? Is it demonstrably better than "pruning at random"?
In summary, I found the paper to be well-done and enjoyable.
