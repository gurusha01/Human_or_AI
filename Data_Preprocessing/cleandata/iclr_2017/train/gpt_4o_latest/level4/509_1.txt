This paper introduces a method to make a programming language (Forth) interpreter differentiable, enabling it to learn the implementation of high-level instructions from provided examples. The paper is well-written, and the research is well-motivated. Overall, I found the paper engaging and enjoyable to read. However, the experiments primarily serve as a proof of concept. Conducting more detailed empirical studies could strengthen the paper.
Comments:
- To the best of my knowledge, the proposed approach is novel and effectively bridges programming by example with programmer-provided sketches. While the approach draws inspiration from probabilistic programming and Neural Turing Machines, it is meaningfully distinct from these methods. Additionally, the paper includes optimizations to the interpreter that accelerate the training process.
- It would be valuable to present results on a broader range of programming problems and explore the complexity of low-level code that can be generated.
