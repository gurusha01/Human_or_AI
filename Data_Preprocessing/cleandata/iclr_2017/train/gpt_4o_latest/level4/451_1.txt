I appreciate the authors' efforts in addressing my concerns and providing clarifications. However, I regret to say that I still consider this paper to be a strong reject. The authors' responses did not adequately resolve the key issues I previously highlighted. The paper suffers from poor writing, presents incremental results, and does so in an unclear manner. The proofs are written in such a way that I am unable to verify the validity of the proposed theoretical claims, which appear to form the core of the paper, despite my strong familiarity with the mathematical tools employed.
I would recommend that the authors consider submitting this work to a journal, but only after undertaking a major revision.
The contributions of this paper are incremental, as several related results cited by the authors have already been published. While the authors claim to eliminate certain technical assumptions from prior work, the results they present are both weaker and more technical in nature. The main theoretical contribution, Theorem 2.4, is particularly unconvincing. Additionally, the paper is poorly written, lacking theoretical intuition, featuring a weak experimental section, and containing formatting issues in some parts.
