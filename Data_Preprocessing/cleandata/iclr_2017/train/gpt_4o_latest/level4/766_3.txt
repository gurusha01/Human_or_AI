The authors utilize the widely adopted Fast RCNN detection framework for pedestrian detection, employing "EdgeBoxes" for object proposals and integrating batch normalization into their network. Experimental results are presented on the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets. While the results are reasonable, they do not achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, the paper does not include results on the Caltech Pedestrians dataset, which is the current benchmark for pedestrian detection. More critically, the work lacks any element of novelty.
The detection approach outlined in this paper represents a standard application of Fast RCNN to the task of pedestrian detection. The implementation does not achieve state-of-the-art results, and the work does not introduce any novel contributions. The use of EdgeBoxes with Fast RCNN is not new, and the authors appear to be unaware of more recent advancements in object detection, such as Faster RCNN.
