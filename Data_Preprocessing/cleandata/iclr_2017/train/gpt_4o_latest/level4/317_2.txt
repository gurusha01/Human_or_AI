Apologies for the delay in submitting this review.
This paper proposes addressing Super-Resolution through amortized MAP estimation. A projection step is introduced to ensure consistent HR-LR dependencies, which is experimentally validated to achieve improved results overall. Additionally, three distinct methods for solving the cross-entropy problem in Eq. 9 are proposed and evaluated.
Summary: This is an excellent paper, both well-written and well-presented. The experimental results are adequate, with the inclusion of thoughtfully chosen toy examples and real-world applications. To the best of my knowledge, the contributions to the field of super-resolution (Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) are novel, although some aspects specific to GAN training may have appeared in other forms elsewhere (as noted in the discussion). I believe this paper will have a significant impact on future work in super-resolution. The observation that GAN-based model training produces the most visually appealing results highlights the potential for further exploration in this area.
The manuscript would benefit from a final proofread to address a small number of minor typos.
