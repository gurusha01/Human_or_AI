Overall, this is a well-executed paper.
The proposed model is innovative, aiming to combine the strengths of latent variable models and auto-regressive models. The implementation details and architectural decisions (as highlighted in the pre-review) appear to be sound and well-justified.  
 
On the experimental front, I feel the evaluation could go beyond NLL metrics and sample quality. For instance, demonstrating the model's utility in downstream tasks like classification would strengthen the contribution.  
While this may not represent a groundbreaking advancement, it is undoubtedly a solid piece of work, and I recommend it for acceptance.
