This work builds upon prior research, aiming to develop a method analogous to batch normalization but tailored for RNNs. However, I find the experimental results unconvincing; it remains unclear whether this approach outperforms alternatives like Layer Normalization or does so in a meaningful way. Similarly, the reported speedup, while noticeable, does not appear to be an order of magnitude improvement. Additionally, the theoretical analysis does not seem to offer any novel insights.
Overall, while this represents solid incremental progress, I feel it may not yet meet the threshold of significance required for acceptance at ICLR.
