The paper introduces an intriguing framework for image generation that combines the foreground and background to create a complete image. This is undoubtedly a sensible approach when a distinct foreground object is present. However, real-world images are often more complex, frequently involving multiple compositional layers rather than a straightforward foreground-background structure. How would the proposed method handle such scenarios?
In summary, this is a solid piece of work that tackles a significant problem from a novel perspective. Nevertheless, I believe substantial efforts are still required to develop it into a more generalizable methodology.
