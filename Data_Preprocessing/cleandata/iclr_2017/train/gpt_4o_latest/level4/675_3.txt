This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of various approaches to curriculum learning. My primary concern lies with the dataset used, which appears to be highly specific and not adequately justified, as also pointed out by AnonReviewer3. It would have been beneficial to include experiments on more standard tasks. Additionally, I find it difficult to understand how the FFNN models achieve such high performance; further clarification on this point would be appreciated (refer to my final comment).
That said, the paper is well-written, and the comparisons between the proposed methods are compelling, with potential applicability to other datasets.
The manuscript is excessively long at 18 pages. I recommend condensing the content or relocating some of the results to an appendix.
Lastly, the proposed method bears a striking resemblance to the approach outlined in "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines" (Zaremba et al., 2016).
