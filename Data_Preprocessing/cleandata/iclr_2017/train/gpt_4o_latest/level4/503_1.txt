The paper introduces the Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU), a novel building block for connectionist models designed to process multiple modalities effectively.
(Figure 2) For the bimodal case, the model outputs a weighted activation based on the gating units' gains. Do you employ any specific mechanism to ensure that the multi-modal case is also appropriately weighted? Specifically, how would the equation for \( h \) in Section 3.1 be extended to accommodate the multi-modal scenario? Additionally, what motivated the choice of the tanh nonlinearity over alternatives like ReLU? Was this decision based on experimental optimization?
I would be interested in seeing a discussion on the model's ability to handle missing data when one or more modalities are unavailable during testing. Is it feasible for the current model to adapt to fewer modalities in such cases? A synthetic example seems to suggest this might be possible. Including such results in Table 2 could strengthen this claim.
In the synthetic experiment, it would be more appropriate to compare GMU against a fully-connected MLP model with comparable complexityâ€”specifically, one with at least two hidden units (as GMU has two per modality) followed by logistic regression. This would provide a fairer comparison in terms of the models' ability to define decision boundaries.
A broader discussion on related work would be valuable, particularly regarding mixture-of-experts models, which are conceptually quite similar, and multiplicative RNN models [1]. Additionally, the gating unit in LSTMs could theoretically serve a similar purpose when multiple modalities are concatenated in the input. Expanding on these connections would provide better context for the GMU's contributions.
Overall, the paper presents an interesting idea, as does the associated (and soon-to-be-released) dataset.
Minor comments/typos:
- Sec. 3.3: "layers and a MLP (see Section 3.4)" should be revised to "layers and an MLP."
