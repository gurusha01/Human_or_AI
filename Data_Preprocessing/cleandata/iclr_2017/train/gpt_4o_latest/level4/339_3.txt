This paper demonstrates that incorporating a cache model on top of a pre-trained RNN can enhance language modeling performance, while also highlighting a limitation of standard RNN modelsâ€”namely, their inability to independently capture this type of information. Whether this limitation arises from the constrained BPTT window size (commonly set to 35) or an inherent shortcoming of the RNN architecture itself, the insight provided here is valuable. The proposed technique represents an intriguing variation of memory-augmented neural networks, offering several advantages over many conventional memory-augmented architectures.
The authors evaluate the neural cache model not only on the Penn Treebank but also on WikiText-2 and WikiText-103, two datasets specifically designed to reflect long-term dependencies and feature a more realistic vocabulary size. Notably, I have not encountered prior work demonstrating the ability to reference up to 2000 words back. Furthermore, the paper includes an extensive analysis of hyperparameters across these datasets, offering additional valuable insights.
I find this paper to be both compelling and thoroughly analyzed, and I recommend it for acceptance.
