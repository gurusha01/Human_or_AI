Disclosure: I am not a specialist in machine translation algorithms.
Summary: Human translators typically do not produce a final translation in a single step. Instead, they follow an iterative process, beginning with a rough draft and progressively refining it. This paper proposes a similar framework for an automated system.
Overall, the paper is well written.
However, I believe that including diagrams to illustrate the architectures would greatly enhance the reader's understanding of how the various algorithms are interconnected.
I particularly appreciate that the authors conducted a preliminary experiment to provide insight into the complexity of the task. It would be beneficial to emphasize the connection between identifying errors in a guessed translation and the process of iterative refinement. Could the use of post-edited text provide a more robust ground truth?
My primary concern with this paper lies in the experimental section, where the iterative approach is applied to improve only one specific type of machine translation. This raises the following questions:
- Why was this particular approach chosen for improvement?
- To what extent does the improvement depend on the quality of the initial draft (e.g., was the initial draft particularly poor)?
Here are a few minor typographical issues:
- p.2: "...a lookup table that replaceS each word..."?
- p.3: I might be mistaken, but it seems that j is used for two different purposes, which could be confusing.
- p.3: "...takes as input these representationS and outputs..."?
