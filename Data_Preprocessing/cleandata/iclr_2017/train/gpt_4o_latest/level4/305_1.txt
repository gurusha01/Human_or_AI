This paper is the most compelling work on image compression using deep neural networks that I have encountered to date. It is exceptionally well-written, and the incorporation of rate-distortion theory into the objective integrates seamlessly within the proposed framework. The authors compare their approach against a solid baseline (JPEG2000, rather than merely JPEG as in prior works), which strengthens the evaluation. I anticipate that this paper will have a significant impact.
That said, I strongly recommend including results on standard benchmark images such as Lena, Barbara, and Baboon (though not Gibbons), along with comparisons to state-of-the-art classical methods, as highlighted in my earlier questions. It is crucial to explicitly clarify how neural network-based methods stack up against the best traditional approaches. In its current form, the paper does not provide a clear positioning of these two categories of methods relative to one another.
