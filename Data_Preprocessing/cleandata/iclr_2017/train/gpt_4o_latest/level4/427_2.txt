The authors present a method to visualize which regions of an image predominantly influence a specific DNN response. They extend the foundational approach by Robnik-Sikonja and Kononenko (2008) with elegant and compelling modifications tailored for DNNs, thereby enhancing its utility for analyzing images and deep neural networks.
The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, supported by convincing examples (though these are handpicked). It would be beneficial to include at least one figure showcasing the analysis on, for instance, 24 randomly selected samples from ImageNet. Additionally, I would appreciate a comparison of the proposed method with other approaches mentioned in the introduction, such as gradient-based or deconvolution-based methods.
The manuscript is exceptionally well-written, providing all necessary details, and is a pleasure to read.
Overall: Understanding how DNNs operate and derive their conclusions is a critical topic of discussion. The authors' method makes a significant contribution to this field and has the potential to drive further advancements. For example, I found figure 8 particularly insightful in illustrating how AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG differ in the regions they use to gather evidence. The method has several potential applications, and I consider it highly impactful.
Update: The authors have effectively addressed all of my suggestions. Consequently, I am raising my rating from 8 to 9.
