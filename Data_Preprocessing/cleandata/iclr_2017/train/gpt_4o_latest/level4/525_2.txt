Summary  
This paper introduces an algorithm for learning the structure of continuous SPNs in a single pass through the data, primarily by "growing" the SPN when correlations between variables are detected.
NOTE  
I am not deeply familiar with SPNs and therefore cannot fully assess the significance of the presented results, particularly due to my limited knowledge of the datasets used.
Pro  
- The work appears potentially impactful, offering a straightforward and elegant algorithm for single-pass SPN structure learning, as opposed to relying on random structures, which has been the common approach in prior online settings.
Con  
- Significant updates were made to the paper between the submission deadline and the review period.  
- The paper appears hastily written—at least in its initial version—and lacks polish.  
- The comparison to existing literature is inadequate. For example, the paper mentions "several automated structure learning techniques have been proposed," followed by six citations, but provides no discussion of these methods, their relevance, or which are most closely related. There is also no exploration of which ideas from the offline setting might translate to the online setting. Additionally, since the work addresses both joint structure and parameter learning, a comparison to prior online parameter learning approaches (e.g., the three cited works) would be valuable. Specifically, methods like Bayesian Moment Matching from Jaini (2016) seem more principled and warrant discussion.  
- I lack sufficient expertise in SPNs and the datasets to confidently evaluate the strength of the results. However, the performance on larger datasets appears somewhat underwhelming compared to the Random baseline.
Remaining questions after the paper updates  
- Table 3: While using a Random structure as a baseline is reasonable, how were the parameters for this baseline learned? Was it through your simple running average method or more advanced techniques?  
- Table 1: You report positive average log-likelihood values, but shouldn't these be averages of log(p ≤ 1), which would yield values < 0? Could you clarify what I am missing here?  
I recommend rejection, primarily because the paper should have been completed and refined by the submission deadline, rather than undergoing significant updates during the review period.
