The paper reinterprets feedforward neural networks as a multi-agent system.
It appears to begin with a flawed assumption that multi-layer neural networks were originally designed to be expressed as full matrix multiplications. This overlooks the extensive history of artificial neural network development, which was inspired by biological neurons and initially conceptualized as units with arbitrarily sparse connectivity operating in parallel. The matrix-based formulation is primarily a matter of notational convenience; moreover, when employing sparse matrix operations (or convolutions), zeros are neither stored nor explicitly multiplied.
Beyond the shift in terminology—essentially rebranding neurons as agents—the paper fails to introduce any novel or compelling contributions.
Drawing meaningful insights from a different field, such as multi-agent systems, would indeed be valuable. However, to be persuasive, this would require introducing largely novel concepts to neural network research, supported by robust empirical evidence demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy or efficiency. Unfortunately, the current paper does not meet these criteria.
