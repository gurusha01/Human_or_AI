This paper examines the use of dependency trees in comparison to standard window contexts for word vector learning.  
While the objective is commendable, the paper does not provide a sufficiently comprehensive analysis of the topic.  
It overlooks the evaluation of Glove-like objective functions, which are often more effective than the methods employed in this study.  
Additionally, it does not offer absolute comparisons with other established vectors or models.  
The work does not yield any notably impactful insights that could influence future research.  
Nor does it advance the state of the art or contribute new resources for the community.
