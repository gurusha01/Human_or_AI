I concur with the other reviewer that the scope of application areas discussed in the paper is rather narrow. While I appreciate the overarching goal of the paper, which is to assess the effectiveness of several recent techniques in this domain alongside recurrent networks, the limited range of tasks explored is a notable shortcoming.
The paper positions itself as a proposal for improving recurrent baselines through the use of specific methods (or a collection of methods) in experimental settings. However, it does not convincingly demonstrate—or at least does not provide evidence of—generalizability to other tasks. For these methods to serve as replacements for traditional baselines on a broader scale, their effectiveness must be validated across a diverse set of tasks, rather than being confined to a particular subset of applications.
One of the strengths of the paper is its ambition to evaluate numerous recent techniques and its inclusion of multiple experimental replications to support this effort. This is commendable. However, it remains unclear whether there are synergies between some of the proposed enhancements and sentiment analysis, as the current results do not provide sufficient insight. It would be valuable to investigate whether these findings extend to a broader range of tasks to better understand their general applicability.
