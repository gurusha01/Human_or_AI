I appreciate the creativity of this paper in applying computer vision techniques to Biology. However, while this could make for an interesting narrative, I am not convinced that biologists would find the "Tree of Life" constructed using this method particularly meaningful. The paper lacks substantive biological content, both in its methodology and evaluation. At its core, the work is essentially a hierarchical clustering of visual categories, with the ground truth assumed to be the WordNet hierarchy. This assumption is problematic, as WordNet may not accurately reflect biological inheritance relationships between speciesâ€”if such relationships can even be definitively defined. For instance, the concept breaks down for interbreeding dog species and is entirely irrelevant for non-biological categories like vehicles. 
If the focus is purely on visual relationships rather than inheritance relationships, then a graph structure would be more appropriate than a tree. Trees are unnecessarily restrictive and can impose misleading relationships. For example, in ImageNet, a photo of a "toy rabbit" is placed in the devices hierarchy, making it maximally distant from "rabbit" in the animal hierarchy. This tree-based structure suggests that the two images are as semantically unrelated as possible, which is clearly not the case. Our visual world does not naturally conform to a hierarchical structure, though our biological world can reasonably be represented as one. 
One could frame the task as attempting to recover the biological inheritance tree from visual inputs, but this would be inherently challenging due to phenomena like convergent evolution. Nevertheless, it would be possible to evaluate how well different visual features capture the hierarchical relationships of biological organisms. Unfortunately, this paper does not pursue that direction. Even if it did, the work might still come across as a solution in search of a problem. While the authors suggest that this exercise could help us better understand deep features, it is unclear what meaningful insights are actually gained. Evaluating whether a particular feature produces meaningful class-to-class distances is a valid question, but neither the biological tree of life nor the WordNet hierarchy seems like the appropriate ground truth for this purpose (and I would argue they are not).
Lastly, the paper mentions human baselines, but the evidence provided is unconvincing. Statements like "Experiments show that the proposed method using deep representation is very competitive to human beings in building the tree of life based on the visual similarity of the species" and "The reconstructed quality is as good as what human beings could reconstruct based on the visual similarity" are not substantiated with sufficient experimental detail. The claim appears to rest on a qualitative result and a subjective declaration that the method performs as well as humans, which is inadequate for a rigorous evaluation.
