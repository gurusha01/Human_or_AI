This paper establishes a link between Bourgain's junta problem, existing results in circuit complexity, and the approximation of a boolean function using a two-layer neural network. I believe that identifying connections across distinct fields and leveraging the resulting insights represents a meaningful contribution. Therefore, I recommend acceptance.
However, my primary concern is that the scope of this work is restricted to the boolean hypercube, which significantly diverges from practical applications (typically involving continuous domains). While the authors might argue that studying the boolean case is an essential first step, if the proposed connection is confined to this specific setting and cannot be extended to more general scenarios, its broader impact may be limited.
