Pros:  
The authors propose an RNN-based approach as an alternative to WaveNet for generating audio one sample at a time.  
RNNs are a logical choice for this task, making the proposed method an intriguing alternative. Additionally, the authors report significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples.  
A further contribution of this work is the use of a quantitative likelihood-based metric to evaluate the model, complementing the AB human comparisons employed in the original WaveNet study.  
Cons:  
The paper lacks equations that formally describe the model, which could be addressed in the camera-ready version.  
The paper also does not provide sufficient justification for certain modeling decisions:  
- The rationale for using an MLP in the bottom layer instead of another RNN is unclear.  
- The reasoning behind employing r linear projections for up-sampling, rather than reusing the same state for all r samples or utilizing a more expressive transformation, is not well explained.  
As acknowledged by the authors, their WaveNet implementation is likely not as optimized as the original, which raises concerns about the validity of the comparisons.  
Despite these shortcomings, I believe this paper will make a valuable contribution, provided the authors include more detailed explanations of their modeling choices.
