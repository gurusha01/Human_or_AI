This paper introduces a hierarchical infomax method. My comments are as follows:
(1) To begin with, the paper spans 21 pages excluding the appendix, which is excessively lengthy for a conference proceeding. This makes it challenging for readers to follow the content. The authors are encouraged to condense the paper while preserving its core message.
(2) A key contribution of this work is identifying an effective initialization point by maximizing I(X;R). However, it is unclear why maximizing I(X;\breve{Y}) would be beneficial for maximizing I(X;R), as Proposition 2.1 indicates that I(X;\breve{Y}) serves as an "upper" bound for I(X;R). Typically, when directly maximizing a function is difficult, researchers opt to maximize a more tractable "lower" bound instead.
Minor comments:
(1) If Eq. (2.11) is an approximation of Eq. (2.8), the symbol "\approx" should be used.
(2) Why is K_1 used instead of N in Eq. (2.11)?
(3) Should H(X) vanish in Eq. (2.12)?
(4) Consider dividing Section 3 into subsections for better organization.
