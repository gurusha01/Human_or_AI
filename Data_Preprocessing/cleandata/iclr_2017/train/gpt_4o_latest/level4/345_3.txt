This paper revisits a traditional concept of regularization, adapting it for compression in contemporary CNN models designed for resource-constrained devices. Model compression is a highly active area, with many researchers revisiting earlier ideas, making it refreshing to see a study that explicitly leverages classic methods from the early 1990s to achieve competitive performance on standard benchmarks.
There isn't much to critique here: the work exemplifies a straightforward idea applied successfully to a significant problem, presented clearly and supported by relevant references to foundational approaches. The inclusion of filter visualizations further strengthens the contribution.
