This review is based on an informed estimation, as I am unable to fully assess the paper due to my lack of understanding of its content. Despite dedicating several hours to reading and attempting to comprehend the paper, I found it challenging to follow. This difficulty stems partly from my own limitations, but also from the paper's highly abstract level of presentation. While the paper is clearly written, it resembles the clarity of a N. Bourbaki book—precise but demanding for readers unfamiliar with the framework.
I would prefer to defer the accept/reject decision to other reviewers who may possess a better grasp of the material. Even if the paper contains significant errors, I am not in a position to identify them. My overall recommendation leans positive because the paper appears well-written and the empirical evaluation is promising. However, I believe additional effort is necessary to make the work accessible to a broader audience that might be interested in the topic.
As such, my feedback focuses solely on the presentation. 
The primary challenge I encountered lies in the authors' reliance on abstract formalism without grounding it in concrete examples. When examples are introduced, they appear abruptly, without clear connections to the preceding concepts. 
A key example that could clarify the paper for many readers is the relationship between convolution or inner product operations and the framework described. For instance, convolution is typically associated with space (or time) and is understood as an equivariant operation—shifting the input signal results in a corresponding shift in the output. However, the paper does not explain how the '(x, x')' pairs used to construct relations, structures, and invariance relate to this familiar setting. 
The progression from sets, to relations, to functions, to operators, and ultimately to shift-invariant operators (e.g., convolutions) involves multiple conceptual steps. Some additional guidance or "hand-holding" would greatly aid understanding.
For example, why is a 3x3 convolution associated with 9 relations? Do these relations represent the input at a specific coordinate and its contribution to the output (e.g., \( w{\text{offset}} x{\text{i-offset}} \))? If so, why does the diagram include a backward arrow from the center node to other nodes? And why are there arrows connecting different nodes? 
Furthermore, terms like "Cardinal" and "Cartesian convolution" are not standard in signal processing. What do these terms mean in this context? Are they related to separable filters? Similarly, the symbols X and Square in Figure 2 are not explained, nor are the horizontal and vertical sub-graphs. What do \( x1 \), \( x{1,1} \), \( x{1,2} \), and \( x{1,3} \) represent, and how are they related?
While these questions may seem trivial to the authors, I believe part of the responsibility of publishing a paper is to make the material accessible by addressing such questions directly. Doing so would significantly lower the barrier for readers to grasp the core ideas.
Although the authors aim to address a general case, dedicating some effort to explain how a specific, simple case fits within the general framework would be highly beneficial. For instance, the authors could clarify the roles of \( x \), \( xI \), and \( xS \) using the simplest possible example, such as convolving a 1x5 signal with a 1x3 filter. They could also illustrate how the convolution filter parameters appear in the function \( f \), as well as how spatial invariance (or equivariance) in convolution is reflected in their framework.
In summary, while the paper is promising and well-written, its abstract presentation makes it difficult to follow. Grounding the formalism with concrete examples and addressing the questions raised above would significantly enhance its accessibility and impact.
