This paper introduces a weakly supervised, end-to-end neural network model designed to address a challenging natural language understanding task.  
Building on the Neural Programmer, the study seeks to resolve ambiguities inherent in natural language.  
By defining a set of operations in advance, the model learns to bridge the gap between language reasoning and answer composition through backpropagation.  
When evaluated on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, the model demonstrates slightly improved performance compared to traditional semantic parser approaches.  
In summary, this work is both intriguing and promising, as it tackles significant real-world challenges in natural language understanding.  
The model's intuitions and design are well-articulated, though the complexity of the approach makes the paper somewhat challenging to follow, which could hinder reimplementation efforts.  
Providing additional details on model ablation would be beneficial, as it could help identify the most impactful aspects of the model's design.
