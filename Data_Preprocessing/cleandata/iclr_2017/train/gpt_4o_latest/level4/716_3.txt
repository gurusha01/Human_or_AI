This paper presents a fast image semantic segmentation network. It integrates multiple techniques to construct a system that significantly outperforms the baseline SegNet approach in terms of speed, while achieving comparable or slightly lower accuracy across most of the three datasets evaluated.
The techniques and design choices employed to achieve these speed optimizations are listed and explained, along with the underlying intuitions. However, this section does not include measurements or experimental results to quantify the impact of these individual choices. In my view, such analysis would have been a critical addition to the paper. As it stands, the reader is only provided with the final evaluation metrics, which suggest a speed/accuracy tradeoff but offer limited insight into how the individual components contribute to the overall performance.
Furthermore, I believe the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other existing systems. The comparison tables only include SegNet, despite the related work section discussing several contemporary systems. Including additional datasets, such as Pascal or COCO, could also enhance the evaluation, potentially with a larger version of the ENet model.
The proposed system appears to deliver strong speed performance with reasonable accuracy on most benchmarks. However, as a practical implementation paper, it would be more compelling if it provided a detailed analysis of the contributions of each component, as well as insights into sizing and tuning, to offer a more complete and informative assessment.
