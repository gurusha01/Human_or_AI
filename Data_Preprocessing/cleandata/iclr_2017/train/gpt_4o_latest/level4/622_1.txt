The authors' responses have not persuaded me to alter my opinion. I continue to believe that this paper warrants a clear rejection.  
The work explores how spin glass techniques, initially introduced in Choromanska et al. to analyze the loss surface of deep neural networks, can be extended to deep residual networks. While this is an intriguing direction, I find the results to be overly similar to those in Choromanska et al., which significantly limits the novelty of the contribution. The primary theoretical techniques employed in the paper were already introduced in the prior work, and the main theoretical results referenced were, in fact, previously established. Furthermore, the authors have not addressed many of the assumptions carried over from Choromanska et al., such as path-independence and assumptions regarding weight distributions.
