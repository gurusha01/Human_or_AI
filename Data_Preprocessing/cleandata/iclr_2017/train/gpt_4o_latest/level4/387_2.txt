The paper explores a straightforward extension of the CNN-based texture descriptors for image generation introduced by Gatys et al. As in Gatys et al., the proposed approach employs the empirical intra-channel correlation matrix of CNN feature responses at a specific layer of a deep network as the texture descriptor. However, unlike Gatys et al., this method captures longer-range correlations by introducing a shift between the correlated feature responses, resulting in a simple modification of the original architecture.
The concept is simple yet produces intriguing effects on the generated textures and can potentially be generalized to transformations beyond translation. While the original method by Gatys et al. could account for longer-range correlations by leveraging the responses of deeper CNN features, the authors demonstrate that explicitly modeling these correlations using shallower features is more effective, which is a reasonable and compelling observation.
A notable limitation of this work, shared with most similar approaches, is the absence of a rigorous quantitative evaluation protocol, leaving the assessment of the method's effectiveness largely qualitative. Although this limitation is understandable given the inherent challenges of addressing this open problem, it remains somewhat restrictive that no systematic evaluation framework was proposed or implemented. The authors suggest that a classification-based evaluation method could be explored in future workâ€”this is a promising direction that warrants further investigation.
