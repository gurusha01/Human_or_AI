The paper presents an empirical study aimed at demonstrating two key points: 1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with smaller batch sizes tends to converge to flatter minima, and 2. flatter minima exhibit better generalization properties.
Strengths and Weaknesses:  
While the paper lacks significant novelty, it provides valuable insights into intriguing questions regarding the generalization of deep networks.
Impact:  
The findings have the potential to influence both theoretical and practical domains. Theoretically, they can guide the formulation of realistic assumptions for developing new frameworks, while practically, they may inspire heuristic approaches to design algorithms that enhance generalization by strategically adjusting mini-batch sizes.
Feedback:  
Initially, I had concerns about the validity of a specific claim made by the authors regarding the scale invariance of their proposed sharpness criterion. However, this issue has been addressed in the revised version, where the authors have removed the claim.
