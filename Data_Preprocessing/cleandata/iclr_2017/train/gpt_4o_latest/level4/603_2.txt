Review - Pros:  
  Applying neural networks to a novel domain.
Cons:  
  The method does not clearly demonstrate how the network ensures the generation of syntactically correct code.
Questions, comments:  
  How is the NT2N+NTN2T top-5 accuracy calculated? Is it based on maximizing the product of the posterior probabilities for the two classifications?  
  Were all possible combinations of NT2N decisions with every potential NTN2T considered?  
  Incorporating UNK is straightforward and should have been part of all models from the outset, as the authors determined the lexicon size, thereby constraining the range of possible predictions.  
  The more pertinent question would be identifying the optimal alpha value for UNK.  
  Refer also to my earlier comment regarding the estimation and use of UNK.  
  In Section 5.5, the second paragraph compares values that are not directly comparable.
