The authors introduce a recurrent neural network architecture capable of producing more accurate long-term predictions across various game environments compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches.  
The proposed architecture addresses limitations of prior methods, specifically their inability to reliably predict far into the future and to directly compute future states without sequentially processing all intermediate states.  
The paper includes a thorough experimental evaluation on multiple benchmarks, yielding promising results.  
Overall, the manuscript is well-written and provides clear explanations.  
Highlighting the utility of this future state prediction approach for 3D maze exploration is a noteworthy contribution.  
Minor comments:  
The statement `jumpy predictions have been developed in low-dimensional observation spaces' should include citations to relevant prior work.
