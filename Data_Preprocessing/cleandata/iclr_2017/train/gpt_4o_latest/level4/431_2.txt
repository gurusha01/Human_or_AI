In PALEO, the authors introduce a straightforward model for executing deep neural networks. Interestingly, this simple model proves capable of reasonably predicting computation times for image recognition networks in both single-machine and distributed environments.
The ability to estimate network execution time is highly valuable, and the paper demonstrates that even a basic model can achieve this to a satisfactory degree, which is a notable strength. However, the experiments are limited to a small set of networks with similar architectures (AlexNet, Inception, NiN) and are conducted under a narrow range of conditions. A more comprehensive evaluation, encompassing a diverse array of models (e.g., RNNs, fully connected networks, adversarial models) and scenarios (e.g., varying batch sizes, layer dimensions, and device placement strategies), might expose limitations of the proposed simplified model. For this reason, this reviewer considers the paper to be borderlineâ€”it represents an initial but rudimentary step, lacking the depth of experimental validation necessary to fully substantiate its claims.
With the addition of more experiments, I am revising my score accordingly.
