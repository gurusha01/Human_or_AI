This paper introduces an enhanced formulation of CNNs designed to disentangle geometric transformations from intrinsic features. The proposed network is capable of estimating filter transformations based on the input images.
The work is grounded in a robust technical framework and is driven by a reasonable motivation. However, its practical significance raises certain concerns:
(1) The approach assumes that the input image undergoes a transformation within a specific Lie group (locally). Are such transformations genuinely problematic in real-world scenarios? Modern CNN architectures, such as ResNet, already demonstrate considerable robustness to these types of local distortions. What tangible benefits would this method contribute to the current state of the art? The limited experiments conducted on Cifar-10 do not appear to make a compelling case.
(2) The computational overhead introduced by the method is not addressed.
