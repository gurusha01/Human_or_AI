The paper introduces a method that leverages the geometry of data (assumed to be known beforehand) to achieve more consistent sparse coding. Specifically, it enforces that two data samples that are similar or adjacent should have sparse codes with similar support. While the overarching concept is not entirely novel, it is nonetheless intriguing (provided that the adjacency matrix \( A \) is known a priori). The primary contribution lies in the formulation of the regularisation term, which employs an \( \ell1 \)-norm, as opposed to the more commonly used \( \ell2 \)-norm in related approaches.
Building on this concept, the authors propose a new SRSC algorithm, which is thoroughly analyzed and demonstrated to outperform competing methods—those based on \( \ell_2 \)-norm sparse coding regularisation and other techniques—in terms of clustering performance.
Taking inspiration from LISTA, the authors further present an approximate solution to the SRSC problem, termed Deep-SRSC, which functions as a fast encoder. This idea is also compelling and appears efficient based on experimental results on the USPS dataset, although the framework draws heavily from LISTA. However, the motivation for this scheme could be strengthened by more clearly articulating the limitations of SRSC.
In conclusion, the paper is well-written and fairly comprehensive. While the core ideas are not highly original, the proposed algorithm and its implementation appear to be novel and effective.
