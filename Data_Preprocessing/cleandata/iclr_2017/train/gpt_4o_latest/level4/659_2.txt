This paper introduces a sequence transduction model that initially employs traditional statistical alignment methods to generate alignments for an encoder-decoder framework. The study includes experiments conducted on various morphological inflection generation datasets, demonstrating improvements over other models. However, the gains are relatively modest when compared to a soft attention model on certain tasks.
I found the paper to be clearly written and supported by comprehensive experiments and analysis. However, I am concerned that the proposed approach lacks significant differentiation from prior work, resulting in a contribution that is narrowly focused on its application to shorter input sequences. While the authors suggest that their method is well-suited for shorter sequences, they do not provide comparisons with the approaches of Chorowski et al. (2015) or Jaitly et al. (2016), which would strengthen their claims.
In conclusion, this paper is well-executed and well-written, but its novelty and scope are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, I believe this work would be a strong candidate for a short paper.
