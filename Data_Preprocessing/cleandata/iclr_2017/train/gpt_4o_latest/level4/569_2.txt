This paper introduces an attention-based recurrent framework for one-shot learning and demonstrates remarkably strong experimental results on the Omniglot dataset, even surpassing human performance (HBPL). This outcome is somewhat unexpected, given that the approach appears to rely on fairly standard neural network components. The authors mention that others have independently verified the results (was Soumith Chintala among those who reproduced them?) and have also made the source code available.
After reviewing the paper, I am left somewhat puzzled about the source of the significant performance gains, as the model seems to incorporate many of the same elements as prior work. To make the claims more compelling, it would be beneficial for the authors to include results from a broader range of experiments, similar to those conducted in earlier studies (e.g., matching networks). Additionally, an ablation study would provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to the model's strong performance.
