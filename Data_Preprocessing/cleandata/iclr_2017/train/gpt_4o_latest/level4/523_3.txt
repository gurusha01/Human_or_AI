The authors present a compelling, computational-complexity-focused method for efficient softmax computation in language modeling using GPUs. The proposed approach employs an adaptive softmax technique based on a hierarchical model, where dynamic programming is utilized to optimize the hierarchical structure with respect to computational complexity on GPUs.
That said, the robustness of the configuration derived via dynamic programming with respect to performance and perplexity remains unclear. Comparative results using perplexity-based clustering would enhance the evaluation. Specifically, in Section 5, under the Baselines paragraph and in Table 1, it would be beneficial to include results for HSM(PPL) (see Zweig et al. 2013 for reference).
To the best of my knowledge, the first successful application of an LSTM-based language model for large vocabularies was introduced by Sundermeyer et al. in 2012 (reference below), which is notably absent from the summary of prior work at the bottom of page 3.
Overall, the paper is well-written and accessible, though there are areas where the notation could be clarified. Detailed comments on these issues are provided below.
Prior work on LSTM language modeling:  
- Sundermeyer et al.: LSTM Neural Networks for Language Modeling, Interspeech, pp. 194-197, 2012.
Notation:  
- Clarify the use of g(k) versus g(k,B,d): Is g(k) simply g(k,B,d) with B and d held constant?  
- Avoid reusing notation (e.g., B is a matrix in Equation (3) but represents batch size in Section 4.1).  
- The notation p{i+j} (in and around Equation (10)) is somewhat misleading, as p{i+j} does not appear to be equivalent to p_{(i+j)}.
Minor comments:  
- Page 1, item list at bottom, first item: "take" → "takes"  
- Page 5, second paragraph: "will then contained" → "will then contain"  
- Page 5, third paragraph: "to associated" → "to associate"  
- Section 4.3, first paragraph: "At the time being" → "For the time being"  
- Below Equation (9): "most-right" → "right-most"  
- Below Equation (10): "the second term of this equation" → "the second term of the right-hand side of this equation"  
- Page 6, second-to-last line: "smaller that the" → "smaller than the"  
- Page 7, Section 5, itemized list, first item: "100 millions" → "100 million"  
- Page 8, last sentence: "we are the" → "ours is the"
The function g() is used in multiple configurations with varying variables. Please provide explicit definitions (e.g., is g(k,B,d) equivalent to g(k) when B and d are constant?). Additionally, several references or citations appear to be missing or erroneous (e.g., "(?)" in the text). Please ensure these are corrected and properly cited.
