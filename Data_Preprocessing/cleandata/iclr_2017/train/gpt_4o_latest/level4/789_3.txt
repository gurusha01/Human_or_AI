The authors contend that standard ancestral sampling from stochastic autoencoders (e.g., Variational Autoencoder and Adversarial Autoencoder) imposes an overly restrictive requirement that the encoder distribution must marginally align with the latent variable prior. To address this, they propose an alternative approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which eliminates the need to specify a simple parametric form for the prior.
The paper, however, is not clearly written. Most notably, the notation employed by the authors is either fundamentally flawed or reflects a misunderstanding of probability distribution manipulations. For instance, the authors appear to suggest that both Q(Z|X) and Q(X|Z) are parametrized distributions. For this to hold, the model would need to be either trivially simple or an energy-based model, yet there is no indication that the authors are referring to an energy-based model. Another potential source of confusion is the claim that the ratio of distributions Q(Z|X)/P(Z) = 1. This seems to be a misstatement, as it is likely intended to represent a ratio of marginals, such as Q(Z)/P(Z) = 1. Overall, there appears to be significant ambiguity regarding the definitions and roles of Q and P. In standard VAE notation, P typically denotes the decoder distribution, while Q represents the encoder distribution. However, the authors do not seem to adhere to this convention, nor do they provide a consistent alternative interpretation.
The empirical evaluation is limited to qualitative results (e.g., samples and reconstructions) derived from a single dataset (CelebA). Moreover, the generated samples fall short of the quality achieved by state-of-the-art models. The interpolations presented in Figures 1 and 3 also appear to resemble pixel-space interpolations for both the baseline VAE and the proposed DVAE model.
