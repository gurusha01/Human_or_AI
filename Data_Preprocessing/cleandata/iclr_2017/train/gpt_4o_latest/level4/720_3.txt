In this paper, the author introduces a method for combining features from two embeddings, v1 and v2. The approach involves first calculating the pairwise combinations of the elements of v1 and v2 using a complex nonlinearity, followed by selecting the K-Max values to form the output vector. For triple (or higher-order) combinations, the method performs two (or more) consecutive pairwise combinations to generate the final representations. However, the approach does not appear to be specifically tailored to categorical data and seems applicable to any embeddings, including those that are not one-hot encoded. This raises the question: what is the specific motivation behind this approach, and how does it connect to the problem being addressed?
Additionally, there are several existing works with similar ideas. For instance, CCPM (A Convolutional Click Prediction Model), which the authors have used for comparison, employs a comparable network structure (conv + K-max + conv + K-max). However, the paper does not discuss the conceptual similarities and differences between the proposed method and CCPM. Similarly, Compact Bilinear Pooling...
