This paper presents a novel formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through the perspective of density ratio estimation, specifically leveraging Bregman divergences. While GANs inherently perform density estimation, the use of Bregman divergences is motivated by the aim of deriving an objective function with stronger gradients. However, I have three primary concerns regarding this submission.
First, the paper's exposition requires substantial improvement. The current manuscript is, at times, difficult to follow and fails to effectively motivate, articulate, and substantiate the proposed contributions.
Second, the authors introduce a variety of alternatives and heuristics throughout the description of the proposed b-GAN framework. This adds significant complexity to understanding, implementing, and utilizing b-GAN. A more principled approach is needed to systematically eliminate many of the proposed algorithmic variants.
Third, the experimental results, particularly Figures 2, 3, and 4, are nearly impossible to interpret. The authors assert that these figures demonstrate that "learning does not stop," but this behavior could equally be attributed to the typical chaotic dynamics observed in GANs. Even after reviewing Appendix A, I remain unconvinced that the proposed approach offers any tangible practical advantage, especially given the lack of comparisons to other GAN methods with similar architectures.
In summary, this submission requires substantial revisions before it can be considered suitable for publication.
