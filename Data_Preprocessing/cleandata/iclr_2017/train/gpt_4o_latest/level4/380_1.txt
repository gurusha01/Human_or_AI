This paper tackles a significant limitation of generative adversarial networks: their inability to evaluate held-out data effectively. While prior approaches, such as BiGANs/ALI, address this issue by introducing a separate inference network, the authors of this work propose modifying the GAN objective function so that the optimal discriminator also serves as an energy function, rather than becoming uninformative at equilibrium. The proposed training process for this new objective relies on approximating the gradients of the generated data's entropy, which is inherently challenging. To address this, the authors present two approximation methods: one based on nearest neighbors and another leveraging a variational lower bound. The experimental results demonstrate that, on toy datasets, the learned discriminator/energy function closely aligns with the log probability of the data, while on more complex datasets, the discriminator provides a reliable measure of quality for held-out data.
The primary limitations of the paper, in my view, are practical concerns related to the scalability of the nearest neighbors approximation and the accuracy of the variational approximation, both of which the authors acknowledge. Additionally, given the close relationship between entropy estimation and density estimation, I wonder whether any practical implementation of EGANs might ultimately converge to a form of approximate density estimation—precisely the problem GANs were originally designed to circumvent. Nevertheless, the paper's elegant mathematical formulation and theoretical contributions make it a valuable addition to the field.
A few minor issues with the writing should also be noted. For example, the sentence at the top of page 5, "Finally, let's whose discriminative power," appears incomplete or unclear, and it is difficult to discern the intended meaning. Furthermore, the title does not fully capture the significance of the work—it gives the impression of a minor improvement to an existing training method rather than the introduction of a novel training framework.
