This paper investigates transfer in reinforcement learning between agents with potentially distinct morphologies. The central concept involves the source and target agents learning a shared skill, which is then leveraged to create abstract feature spaces, facilitating the transfer of a new, unshared skill from the source agent to the target agent. The work connects to prior research on transfer using shared latent spaces, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its extensions, including manifold alignment and kernel CCA.
The experiments are conducted in a basic physics simulator, involving robot arms with three and four links. A simple CCA-based approach is used as a baseline for comparison, though it would have been more compelling to include comparisons with more contemporary methods, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA. The latent feature spaces are constructed using a three-layer neural network.
The problem of transfer in reinforcement learning is highly significant but remains underexplored. This work introduces an intriguing hypothesis by proposing transfer based on shared skills between the source and target agents, which is a promising direction. However, the comparisons with related methods are somewhat outdated, and the experimental domains are relatively simplistic. Additionally, there is limited theoretical development of the proposed ideas within the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory.
