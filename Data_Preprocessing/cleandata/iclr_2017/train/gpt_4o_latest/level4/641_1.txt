The paper introduces two methods under the umbrella of wild variational inference. The primary objective is to generate samples from the variational approximate distribution \( q \) without requiring direct evaluation of its density \( q(z) \), thereby enabling the use of more flexible distribution families. The proposed methods are applied to the task of optimizing the hyperparameters of the SGLD sampler. Experiments are conducted on a 1-dimensional Gaussian mixture distribution and Bayesian logistic regression tasks.
The main contribution appears to lie in linking prior findings in SVGD and KSD to the concept of inference networks and leveraging this connection for hyperparameter optimization of SGLD. However, this contribution can be seen as a relatively straightforward extension, and the simplicity of the experiments does not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of the proposed approach. In particular, it is unclear how particle-based methods would handle multimodality in more complex scenarios beyond the simple 1-dimensional Gaussian mixture case. Additionally, the method still seems to require computation of the true gradient of the target distribution (e.g., the posterior) for each \( z \sim q \), which could pose computational challenges for large-scale datasets. In the experiments, the authors compare methods based on the same number of update steps, but given the computational efficiency of SGLD per update, it is likely that SGLD could perform significantly more updates within the same time frame, especially for large datasets. Furthermore, the Bayesian logistic regression experiment, conducted in 54 dimensions, appears overly simplistic, as the posterior in this case is likely close to a Gaussian distribution. Including comparisons with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods featuring automatic hyperparameter tuning (e.g., the No-U-Turn Sampler) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
The paper suffers from a lack of clarity in its writing. In particular, the exact contributions of the work relative to prior research, including the authors' own previous work, are not clearly delineated. While the main idea is relatively straightforward, a significant portion of the paper is devoted to explaining prior work, which detracts from the presentation of the novel contributions.
In summary, I recommend conducting more substantial experiments in high-dimensional, large-scale settings and improving the clarity and focus of the writing.
