This paper proposes a nonlinear dynamical model designed for multiple related multivariate time series. The model incorporates a linear observation model conditioned on latent variables, a linear or nonlinear dynamical model connecting consecutive latent variables, and a similarity constraint between pairs of time series (provided as prior information and not learned). The predictions and constraints from the three components of the model are Gaussian, as the model outputs both the mean and the variance or covariance matrix. Inference is performed in a forward-only manner.
The model is tested on four datasets and compared against several baselines, including plain auto-regressive models, feed-forward networks, RNNs, and dynamic factor graphs (DFGs), the latter being RNNs with both forward and backward inference of latent variables.
The model, which introduces lateral constraints between different time series and predicts both the mean and covariance, appears promising but has two notable limitations.
Firstly, the paper should acknowledge and discuss variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and deep Gaussian models, which also perform inference by predicting both the mean and variance.
Secondly, the datasets used for evaluation are very small. For instance, the WHO dataset consists of only 91 time series, each containing 52*10 = 520 time points. While the experimental results suggest that the proposed model outperforms RNNs, the limited size of the datasets and the high variance in the results highlight the need for further experiments on longer time series. Additionally, the paper could be improved by providing more details about the model (e.g., the architecture of the MLP) and including a time complexity comparison between the models, particularly between DFGs and the proposed approach.
Minor comment:
Footnote 2 on page 5 appears to refer to the structural regularization term rather than the dynamical term.
