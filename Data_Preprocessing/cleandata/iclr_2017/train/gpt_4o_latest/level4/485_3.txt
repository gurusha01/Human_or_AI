SUMMARY  
This paper explores how data from a specific type of low-dimensional structure (monotonic chain) can be effectively represented using neural networks with two hidden layers.
PROS  
The paper provides an engaging and accessible perspective on certain capabilities of neural networks, emphasizing dimensionality reduction and suggesting potential avenues for further research.
CONS  
While the paper constructs examples of structures that can be represented by a network, it does not delve into the learning process itself (though it does include experiments where such structures appear to emerge to some extent).
COMMENTS  
It would be valuable to investigate the implications of the presented findings for deeper networks.  
Additionally, it would be useful to examine how comprehensively the proposed framework captures the full range of functions representable by the networks.
MINOR COMMENTS  
- Figure 1 should be referenced earlier in the text.  
- "Color coded"—clarify what the colors represent.  
- Thank you for addressing the points raised in my initial questions. Note: Isometry on the manifold.  
- On page 5, clarify how the orthogonal projection onto \( S_k \) is implemented in the network.  
- On page 6, the term "divided into segments"—consider whether "segments" is the most appropriate word.  
- On page 6, "The mean relative error is 0.98"—explain the baseline or the significance of this value.
