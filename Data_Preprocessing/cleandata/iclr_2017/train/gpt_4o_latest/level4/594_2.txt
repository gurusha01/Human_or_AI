The paper introduces a low-rank variant of pass-through networks aimed at improving capacity control, which, as demonstrated in the experiments, can be beneficial in certain scenarios.  
However, I found the results to be generally unconvincing. The performance does not surpass state-of-the-art methods on tasks like sequential MNIST or the memory task, while introducing an additional hyper-parameter to optimize. As mentioned, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with competing approaches, such as uRNNs, in Tables and/or Figures.
