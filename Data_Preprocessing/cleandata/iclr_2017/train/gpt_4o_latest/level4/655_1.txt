This paper introduces a method to enhance deep transfer learning by leveraging basic probability assignment. Specifically, it proposes a re-weighting scheme inspired by Dempster-Shafer theory, which utilizes the confusion matrix of the source task. Additionally, the authors propose separately learning convolutional filters as a means to address non-convexity.
The primary issue with this submission lies in its writing quality. The manuscript contains numerous typos, and the presentation is unclear. For instance, the process by which the training set for weak classifiers is constructed remains ambiguous, even after the authors' prior clarification. I also find the explanation for using both the training and validation sets to compute BPA unconvincing. Furthermore, I am skeptical that non-convexity is a significant concern in this context, and the authors fail to provide an ablation study to justify the necessity of separately learning the filters. Lastly, a key question remains unanswered: CIFAR has three channels, while MNIST has only oneâ€”how is this disparity addressed when pairing the datasets in the second set of experiments?
In summary, while the proposed re-weighting approach is an interesting idea, the paper requires significant improvement and clarification. 
I recommend rejection.
