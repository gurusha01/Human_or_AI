This well-crafted paper introduces an end-to-end learning approach for image compression. By leveraging rate-distortion optimization and an innovative relaxation technique, the method effectively learns a robust image compression strategy using a dataset of natural images.
Given the method's novelty, the compelling results, and the comprehensive analysis, I find it straightforward to recommend this paper for acceptance.
