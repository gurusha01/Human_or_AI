While my earlier title suggestion may be overly detailed, it would better reflect the content of the paper compared to the current title. A more suitable title might lie somewhere between the two extremes.
The proposed approach is compelling, as the three main techniques—auxiliary tasks, skip/diagonal connections, and the use of internal labels tailored to the data—are well-motivated and make logical sense.
Some of the results were challenging to interpret. The explanations provided in the discussion (e.g., my earlier questions regarding Figures 4 and 5) were helpful, and the paper would benefit from incorporating more of these clarifications directly into the text.
It might be useful to briefly address the relationship between "diagonal" connections and other similar concepts, such as "skip connections." The term "skip" seems broadly applicable regardless of network visualization, whereas "diagonal" is more context-dependent and tied to specific visual layouts.
Regarding the comment in the discussion about "less over-segmentation of action bouts" (and the related discussion in Section 5.1): I would appreciate more elaboration on this point in the paper. I initially assumed "per-bout" referred to "per-action event," but I am now uncertain (e.g., can a "bout" span several minutes?). Given the paper's audience, it would be helpful to explicitly define such terms.
On the topic of fly behaviors lasting minutes versus milliseconds: This is an intriguing point. I am curious about how classification accuracy varies with the time scale of the behavior. For instance, are errors more frequent for long-duration behaviors? While this would only provide partial insight (e.g., a long-duration behavior with distinct short-term features might still be easy to classify), it could be worth briefly addressing if feasible. However, if investigating this would require significant additional effort, it might be better suited for future work.
Regarding the scalability to human behavior: While adding convolutional layers above sensory input seems theoretically sound, practical outcomes often diverge from theoretical expectations, as the authors likely recognize. The authors undoubtedly have a deeper understanding of their system's limitations than I do. The presented system is impressive and effectively handles spatiotemporal trajectories, but the claims should remain aligned with the demonstrated results.
I would consider revising my rating to a 7, contingent on future revisions.
In Figure 4b, BESNet and BENet exhibit very similar performance. Notably, BENet outperforms BESNet in the per-bout score both with and without filtering. Do the authors have any intuition or hypotheses about why this might be the case? Could this be related to the minimal differences observed in Figure 5b between the log-likelihoods of RNN and BESNet?
