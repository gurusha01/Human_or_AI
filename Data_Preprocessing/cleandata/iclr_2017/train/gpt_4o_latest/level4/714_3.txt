This paper introduces a method that employs unsupervised learning to extract features within a reinforcement learning framework. However, the term "unsupervised" is ambiguous in this context, as the "causality prior" relies on reward signals for training, which aligns more closely with reinforcement learning rather than unsupervised learning.
The experimental evaluation is underdeveloped, focusing on a simplistic task involving the robot's head movement to the left or right. Additionally, the paper lacks comparisons to baseline methods.
In the conclusions, the authors assert that the proposed approach is applicable to transfer learning, but this claim is not supported by experimental evidence.
Overall, the paper is unclear and underdeveloped.
