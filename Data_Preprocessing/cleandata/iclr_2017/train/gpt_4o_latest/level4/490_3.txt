This study builds upon prior research on pointer models by integrating their outputs with standard softmax outputs.  
The overall concept is compelling, particularly for context biasing, and the proposed approach is relatively straightforward.  
The contribution is somewhat novel, as earlier works have explored combining pointer-based and standard models,  
but not in the form of a mixture model, as presented in this paper.  
The manuscript is well-written, and the results appear encouraging.  
Additionally, the newly created dataset (WikiText) introduced by the authors seems to hold significant value.  
A note on notation:  
The symbol pptr is employed in two distinct ways in equations 3 and 5: pptr(w) versus pptr(yi|x_i).  
This creates confusion since these represent different domains: a set of words in equation 3 and a list of context words in equation 5.  
It would be beneficial to adopt different symbols to distinguish between these two entities.
