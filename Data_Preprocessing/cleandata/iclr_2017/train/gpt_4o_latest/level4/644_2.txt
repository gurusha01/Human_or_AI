[ Summary ]
This paper introduces a modified beam search algorithm designed to encourage diversity among beam candidates. It addresses a well-documented issue—observed in both RNN-based and non-neural language models—where beam search tends to produce candidates that are highly similar to one another. This phenomenon leads to two distinct but related challenges: (1) search error, where the algorithm may fail to identify the globally optimal solution as promising candidates can fall out of the beam early, and (2) generic, non-diverse outputs, where the generated text is overly common and lacks variety.
The focus of this work is on mitigating the second issue (2) by altering the search objective function to explicitly include a term that rewards diversity among beam candidates. Importantly, the proposed algorithm does not aim to address the search error problem inherent to the original objective function. In contrast, traditional methods like stack decoding and future cost estimation, commonly used in phrase-based SMT, are designed to tackle search error directly.
[ Merits ]
The Diverse Beam Search (DBS) algorithm proposed by the authors offers several potential benefits. It could be particularly useful in scenarios where traditional beam search on the original objective function is inadequate—either due to limitations in the trained model, the presence of search errors, or a misalignment between the objective function and the specific goals of the application.
[ Weaknesses ]
However, it is not entirely clear how the proposed method compares to more established techniques such as stack decoding and future cost estimation in tasks like machine translation. The authors primarily benchmark their algorithm against L&J's diverse language models and standard beam search, leaving this comparison unexplored.
Moreover, modifications to the objective function have been previously explored, even in the context of neural machine translation. For instance, see equation (14) on page 12 of the following paper:
