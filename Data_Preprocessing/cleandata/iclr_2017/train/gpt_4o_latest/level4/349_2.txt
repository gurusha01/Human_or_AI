This paper presents an interesting dataset/data generator that produces tasks similar to bAbI, but with the added requirement for the question-answering agent to clarify certain variable values to succeed. I find the baselines employed by the authors to evaluate the tasks to be suitable. My primary concern is that the tasks might be overly simplistic (as was the case with the bAbI tasks), though I still believe they hold local utility. If the generation code is well-implemented and the tasks are designed to be extensible, they could remain valuable for a considerable period.
