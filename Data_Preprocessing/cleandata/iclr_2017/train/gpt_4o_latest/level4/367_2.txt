The paper addresses the challenge of shallow binary autoencoders through a minmax game framework. While the proposed algorithm is straightforward, it demonstrates notable effectiveness. The manuscript is clearly written and supported by robust analyses. Although the method does not directly generalize to deep networks at this stage, its links to other widely-used minmax techniques (e.g., GANs) hold promise for future advancements.
