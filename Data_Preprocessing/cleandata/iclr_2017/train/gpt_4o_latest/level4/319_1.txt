The paper introduces a novel approach to knowledge transfer.  
I appreciate the concept of utilizing attention maps rather than activations.  
That said, the experimental results do not demonstrate significant improvements over standard knowledge distillation, and I believe additional experiments are necessary in the IMAGENET section.  
I would be open to revising my score if the authors expand upon the discussion in Section 4.2.2.
