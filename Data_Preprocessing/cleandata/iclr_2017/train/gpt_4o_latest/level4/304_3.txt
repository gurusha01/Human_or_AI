This paper presents substantial improvements over the original NPI framework, demonstrating that training the model on traces in recursive form leads to significantly better generalization. The authors provide evidence of improved sample complexity and generalization performance on addition and bubblesort tasks, while introducing two novel and more challenging benchmarksâ€”topological sort and quicksort (incorporated following reviewer feedback). Notably, they rigorously prove that the algorithms learned by the model generalize flawlessly, which, to the best of my knowledge, represents a first in the field of neural program induction.
