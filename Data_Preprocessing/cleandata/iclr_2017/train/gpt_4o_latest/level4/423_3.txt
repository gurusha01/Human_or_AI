In this engaging paper, the authors investigate the concept of employing an ensemble of multiple discriminators during generative adversarial network training. This approach offers several advantages, primarily allowing the use of less powerful discriminators, which may provide a more constructive training signal to the generator, particularly in the early stages of training when stronger discriminators could overwhelm the generator.
My primary concern pertains to the presentation of the paper. The caption of Figure 1 and Section 3.1 imply selecting the best discriminator by taking the maximum performance among the individual ensemble members. However, this does not seem to be the optimal approach, as it would likely result in a training signal that is stricter than any single member of the ensemble. Subsequently, the paper delves into relaxing the maximum operation and explores various averaging techniques to create a 'soft-discriminator.' I find this latter idea significantly more compelling, and the experimental results appear to support its effectiveness. From my initial reading, it seemed as though the authors primarily advocated for consistently using the strongest discriminator, as reflected in my earlier pre-review question.
In summary, I believe this paper makes a meaningful contribution, and the concept of leveraging multiple discriminators is a promising avenue for further research.
