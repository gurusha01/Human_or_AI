A few concerns with this paper:
1. I find finding 2 to be trivial and not particularly noteworthy, though the author appears to disagree with this assessment. Refer to the discussions for further details.  
2. Finding 1 is based on Fig 4, which seems excessively noisy and lacks any accompanying error analysis. This raises doubts about the robustness of the finding. Intuitively, one might expect the power usage trend to align more closely with Fig 3, but given the high noise levels, it is difficult to determine whether the null hypothesis—that there is no dependency between batch size and power consumption—is more plausible than the alternative.  
3. The paper is not accessible to colorblind readers or those using black-and-white printers.  
In summary, while the paper provides a reasonable review of the current state of SOTA vision architectures, it offers limited novel insights. The most compelling aspect is its clear demonstration that VGG models stand out as a poor tradeoff in resource-constrained settings. Too often, researchers are tempted to benchmark their model compression techniques on VGG-class models, as these allow for easy claims of 10x improvements with minimal effort.
