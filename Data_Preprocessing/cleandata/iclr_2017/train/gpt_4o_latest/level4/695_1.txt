Review - Summary:  
This paper presents NoiseOut, a novel method for reducing network parameters by pruning neurons. The approach identifies pairs of neurons with the most correlated outputs, merges them into a single neuron, and adjusts the weights accordingly. However, since the technique depends on high correlations between neurons, the authors propose adding an auxiliary output neuron, referred to as a noise output, which encourages the network to predict the mean of a noise distribution. As this mean is constant, it enhances correlations among neurons. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on MNIST and SVHN.
Comments:  
The proposed method offers an intriguing approach to neuron pruning, but additional experiments on larger datasets are likely necessary to demonstrate its general effectiveness and reliability.  
Equation (5) appears to be quite straightforward.  
For larger datasets, would it be necessary to introduce more noise outputs to achieve higher correlations? If so, could this have any adverse effects on the overall accuracy of the network?  
The paper is well-written, clearly presented, and engaging to read. I encourage the authors to further explore and expand upon this promising line of research.
