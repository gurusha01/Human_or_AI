The paper introduces an end-to-end neural network model aimed at addressing the challenge of designing natural language interfaces for database queries. The proposed method relies solely on weak supervision signals to train the model parameters. Unlike traditional approaches, which tackle the problem by semantically parsing a natural language query into logical forms and executing those logical forms on the database, this approach directly maps a natural language query to the final answer by training a neural network in an end-to-end fashion. This is accomplished by representing a set of operations over the database as continuous operations, whose distributions are learned using the widely adopted soft attention mechanisms. The model is evaluated on the relatively small WikiTableQuestions dataset, where a single model underperforms compared to traditional Semantic Parsing techniques. However, an ensemble of 15 models (trained using diverse strategies) achieves performance comparable to the state of the art.
I find the paper to propose an intriguing solution to the challenging problem of learning natural language interfaces for databases. The model builds upon and extends prior work, particularly the models introduced by Neelakantan in 2016. However, the experimental evaluation is somewhat lacking. The authors only demonstrate their model's performance on a single, relatively small dataset. It would have been valuable to see more ablation studies and comparisons against more sophisticated memory network variants (I am not convinced by their initial justification for not benchmarking against memory networks).
That said, I do have a few concerns:
-- The model details are presented in a rather convoluted manner, and Section 2.1 is not clearly articulated. Without access to the accompanying code, replicating the model would be extremely challenging. The authors should provide a clearer explanation of how the discrete operations are modeled and clarify the roles of components such as the "row selector," "scalar answer," and "lookup answer."
-- The authors employ full attention over the entire database. Have they considered whether this approach would scale to much larger databases (e.g., those with millions of rows)? It would have been helpful if they had experimented with larger datasets to assess scalability.
