Thank you for providing an engaging and thought-provoking submission.
Considering the current surge of interest in generative modeling, this paper is highly relevant and offers clear insights into methods that avoid using maximum likelihood for training. It makes an important and valuable observation that the generative and discriminative losses do not necessarily need to be coupled. In essence, this work provides practitioners with practical and insightful guidance on selecting objective functions for training implicit generative models.
The primary reason I refrained from giving a strong acceptance recommendation is my uncertainty regarding ICLR's acceptance criteria. Firstly, the paper's style closely resembles that of the cited works by Sugiyama et al. (e.g., presenting similar ideas from different perspectives but in a different context), which leaves me uncertain about how to assess its novelty. Secondly, the paper lacks both experimental results and formal mathematical theorems, and I am unsure about the specific types of contributions the ICLR committee prioritizes.
