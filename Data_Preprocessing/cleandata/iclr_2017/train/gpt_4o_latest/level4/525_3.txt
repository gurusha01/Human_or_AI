The authors propose an algorithm for constructing sum-product networks (SPNs) from data, assuming a Gaussian distribution across all dimensions of the observed data. Given the constrained nature of SPN architectures, designing a valid structure tailored to a specific dataset is non-trivial, necessitating the use of structure-learning algorithms. For Gaussian-distributed observations, the authors note that prior state-of-the-art methods involve selecting a random SPN that adheres to the completeness and decomposability constraints of SPNs, followed by parameter learning (as described in Jaini 2016). In contrast, the proposed algorithm starts with a fully factorized model and incrementally builds more structure by processing the data, while simultaneously updating node statistics to ensure the SPN remains valid.
The referenced Jaini work plays a significant role in understanding this paper, as it represents (to the best of my limited knowledge) the prior state of the art for SPNs applied to Gaussian-distributed data. Additionally, the authors compare their algorithm's performance on datasets previously studied in Jaini et al. I was personally unfamiliar with most of these datasets, which limited my ability to assess whether the reported log-likelihoods for a given model are indicative of strong or weak performance. Nonetheless, the manuscript reports that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods, such as randomly constructed SPNs, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and Generative Moment Matching Networks, on 5 out of 7 datasets.
Overall:  
To begin, I must acknowledge that I do not feel fully qualified to make a definitive recommendation regarding the acceptance or rejection of this manuscript, as I am not an expert in SPNs. Furthermore, my unfamiliarity with the datasets used in the experiments left me without an intuitive grasp of the algorithm's performance, even when treated as a black-box approach. The algorithm is presented without a clear theoretical foundation or justification, which is not necessarily a flaw but does leave me with limited criteria for evaluating the manuscript. That said, the manuscript is well-written, appears novel to the best of my limited knowledge, and demonstrates competitive performance (5/7 datasets) on the selected benchmarks.
My overall impression is that the contribution feels somewhat limited (e.g., much of the text and experiments closely resemble those in Jaini), though I may be overlooking key aspects. This impression stems largely from my unfamiliarity with the datasets and the domain. I hope that my fellow reviewers, with more expertise in this area, will have the necessary background to assess whether the reported results are significant. As such, I recommend that my review be given minimal weight in the final decision.
Minor Issues:  
- I would have liked to see non-uniform covariances for the Gaussian components in the toy task (Fig. 3).  
- The SPN construction method involves two clear hyperparameters. It would be valuable to analyze how these parameters influence the resulting graph structure. (I raised this as a pre-review question, and the authors responded that they would investigate this further.)
