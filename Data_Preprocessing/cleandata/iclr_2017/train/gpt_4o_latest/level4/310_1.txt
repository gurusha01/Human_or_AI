Thank you for an engaging and thought-provoking submission.
Pros  
- This paper addresses a significant and fundamental problem: understanding communication between two agents. As reinforcement learning continues to expand into diverse applications, this work revisits an essential questionâ€”do machines approach problem-solving in a manner akin to humans?  
- The simplicity of the task allows for an intuitive post-learning analysis.  
- It was intriguing to observe that informed agents utilized multiple symbols to convey messages, whereas agnostic agents depended solely on two symbols.  
Cons  
- When the two images sent belong to different categories, the task essentially reduces to an image classification problem. In such cases, the symbols correspond to the image classes, which the second agent learns to associate with the respective images. As a result, this approach largely resembles a transfer learning problem, which could potentially be trained more efficiently than using a reinforcement learning algorithm.
