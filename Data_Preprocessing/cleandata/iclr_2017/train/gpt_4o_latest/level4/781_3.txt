This paper introduces a novel expert model that selects a sparse subset of the most reliable experts, diverging from the conventional logarithmic opinion pool approach used in a Product of Experts (PoE) framework.
I find the manuscript difficult to follow. Despite my efforts, I was unable to locate a clear and formal definition of the joint model p(x, z) within the text. Such a definition is crucial, as the proposed "EM-like" algorithm should logically emerge from it. At this stage, it is unclear whether such a definition exists at all. Specifically, I am left wondering if there is an objective function that the proposed algorithm iteratively optimizes, ensuring consistent improvement on the training data.
Additionally, I would like to point out that the "product of unifac models" introduced by Hinton appears to pursue a closely related goal, where only a subset of experts is activated to generate the input.
