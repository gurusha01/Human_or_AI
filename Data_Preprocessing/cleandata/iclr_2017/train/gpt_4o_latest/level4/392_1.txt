This paper introduces a novel method for image compression leveraging autoencoders. The experimental results are noteworthy, surpassing the current state of the art in this domain.
Strengths:
+ The paper is written with great clarity, making it feasible for others to replicate the results if desired.
+ The results, when benchmarked against other studies in this area, are highly encouraging. It is worth highlighting—and I believe the authors should have underscored this point more explicitly—that this represents a cutting-edge technology. Given its novelty, it is not unexpected that it does not yet outperform the state of the art in image compression. However, it clearly outperforms other neural network-based compression methods.
Weaknesses:
- The training process appears cumbersome, involving multiple stages, freezing of weights, and other complexities.
- The rationale for Figure 1 is somewhat unclear, as it is not evident what the figure aims to convey. It risks confusing readers by discussing effects related to JPEG, despite the paper focusing on a neural network architecture rather than DCT quantization.
