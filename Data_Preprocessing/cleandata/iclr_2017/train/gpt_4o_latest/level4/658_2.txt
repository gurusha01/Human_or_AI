The paper's objective, as articulated in the manuscript and the responses to other reviewers' comments, is to propose that SPN and MPN can be understood as encoders and decoders within the context of RL. This is an intriguing perspective and could potentially form the basis of a compelling paper.
However:
- The current version of the manuscript, even after the updates and improvements, falls significantly short of convincingly making this argument. The revisions required to effectively communicate this point are not minor but would necessitate a substantial and major rewrite, which exceeds the scope of what the authors have achieved so far.
- The experimental section, as noted by other reviewers, lacks structure and fails to provide clear insights. While I could enumerate the flaws and issues with the experiments, as other reviewers have done, I believe their detailed feedback already covers these points comprehensively, and reiterating them here would add little value.
In summary, the paper does not, in its current form, fulfill the promise of its stated objective. For this reason, I must recommend a clear rejection for this conference.
Regarding the dataset used: MNIST is widely regarded as a toy dataset in contemporary research, and its selection here does little to strengthen the paper's case or persuade readers, including myself, of its significance.
