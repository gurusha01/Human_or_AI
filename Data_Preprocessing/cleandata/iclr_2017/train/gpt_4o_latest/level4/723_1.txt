This paper investigates the application of Open Bigrams (OBs) as a target word representation for handwriting image recognition.
Pros:
- The use of OBs is innovative and engaging.
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulated.
Cons:
- The work lacks a comparison with prior state-of-the-art methods, relying solely on results generated by the authors.
- Additional ablation studies are necessaryâ€”for instance, populating Table 3 with configurations such as rnn0,1, rnn0,1,2, rnn0,1', etc. It remains unclear what drives the observed performance, as it appears that single-character modeling (0) and word endings (') may be the primary contributors.
- Although the use of Open Bigrams is novel, related approaches, such as bag-of-bigrams and n-grams, are not adequately compared or explored. For example:
