This paper lacks any novel contributions to machine learning algorithms: it merely employs the same combination of LSTM and bivariate mixture density networks as proposed by Graves. Furthermore, the detailed explanation provided in the appendix omits a crucial aspect: how the Gaussian parameters are derived as a transformation of the LSTM's output.  
Additionally, there is no numerical evaluation presented to demonstrate that the algorithm offers any improvement over the current state-of-the-art.  
Therefore, I do not believe this paper is suitable for a conference like ICLR. That said, the section discussing the handwriting tasks and data transformation is well-written and engaging. It could potentially be a valuable submission for a conference with a stronger focus on handwriting recognition, though I must note that this is not my area of expertise.
