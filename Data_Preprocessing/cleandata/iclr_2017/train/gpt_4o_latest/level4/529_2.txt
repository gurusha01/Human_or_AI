The authors present a solution to the task of synthesizing melodies. They argue that "language-model"-based approaches using LSTMs exhibit certain limitations, such as a lack of long-range structure and excessive note repetition. To address these issues, the authors propose a two-step approach: first training an LSTM as a standard language model, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize an objective that incorporates non-differentiable music-theory constraints.
While the reinforcement learning approach is suitable for the task, it is relatively straightforward and closely mirrors prior work in text modeling and dialogue generation. As such, the methodology itself does not introduce a novel technique.
In my view, the primary contribution of the paper lies in the novelty, utility, or impact of its application. The authors have clearly invested significant effort into designing the rules and conducting the user study, which is commendable. However, the treatment of music itself feels somewhat simplistic. Despite the effort reflected in the user study, the results seem premature. The piano melodies generated, while semi-plausible, are "musical" in the same way that LSTM-generated Shakespearean text resembles poetry. This is akin to comparing LSTM Shakespeare to n-gram Shakespeare in a user study.
I would caution the authors against relying on the uncritical assumption that a problem is worth pursuing simply because it has been studied before. Research is rife with dead ends (though this work may not necessarily fall into that category), and it is crucial to provide a strong motivation for the study, especially when the application is the central focus of the paper.
The authors should also exercise care in describing their model as "composing." Drawing an analogy to an LSTM trained on Shakespeare, a language model is not truly composing English prose. The distinction between constructing a statistical sequence model and creating art—an activity rooted in communication and real-world semantics—should not be overstated.
I appreciate the authors' efforts to address some of the criticisms regarding the problem setup and encourage them to anticipate such arguments in the paper while providing stronger motivation for the work in future iterations. If the application is the main contribution (given that the methods are not novel), then the motivation becomes a critical component. I also acknowledge their argument that the field benefits from diverse datasets rather than solely relying on language modeling. Furthermore, their assertion that MIDI can fully capture the information in a score is valid, particularly for certain genres like European classical music, where the score holds central importance. However, the authors may overstate the significance of a score in jazz music.
Overall, while the application is engaging, it does not, in my opinion, contribute enough to elevate the paper's impact. Similarly, the methodology, though appropriate, does not stand out as independently significant.
--Update-- I appreciate the authors' modifications and arguments. Based on these, I have revised my scores upward by one point.
