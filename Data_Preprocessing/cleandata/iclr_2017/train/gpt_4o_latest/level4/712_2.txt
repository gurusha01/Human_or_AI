The authors present a recurrent neural network-based approach for developing a stochastic volatility model tailored to financial time series. They propose an inference network leveraging a recurrent neural network to approximate the posterior distribution of latent variables conditioned on past data. This variational approximation is employed to optimize the marginal likelihood, facilitating the learning of model parameters. The methodology is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world time series, demonstrating superior performance compared to parametric GARCH models and a Gaussian process volatility model.

The proposed method appears to be technically sound, except for the observation that in equation (19), the inference model performs filtering rather than smoothing. Specifically, the posterior for \( zt' \) depends solely on other \( zt \) and \( x_t \) values for \( t \).
