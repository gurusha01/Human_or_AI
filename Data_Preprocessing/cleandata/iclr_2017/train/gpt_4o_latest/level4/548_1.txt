Review - Summary:
This paper introduces a regularizer designed to facilitate escaping saddle points during optimization. The method is inspired by concepts from physics, where the optimization process is likened to a positively charged particle moving over the error surface. Saddle points, also modeled as positively charged, exert a repulsive force on the particle. The authors present experimental results across multiple datasets to support their approach.
Overview of the Review:
Pros:
- The idea is innovative and intriguing.
- The method is evaluated on a diverse range of datasets.
Cons:
- The theoretical justification is insufficiently robust.
- The paper suffers from poor organization and clarity.
- The experimental results are not compelling enough.
Criticisms:
The core idea and the intuitions presented in the paper are appealing. However, the paper is not well-structured and requires significant improvement in clarity. For instance, certain variables are introduced without adequate explanation. A notable example is the variable \( p \), which is mentioned in Section 2.3 without proper definition or introduction. The only prior reference to \( p \) is in Equation 6, which itself lacks sufficient explanation. The equations throughout the paper require better contextualization, and the overall flow of the paper would benefit from introducing all variables and concepts systematically before they are used.
Equation 6, in particular, is critical to the paper but is presented without adequate justification or explanation. A detailed discussion of its meaning, especially from an optimization perspective, would greatly enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
Additionally, the paper incorrectly refers to \( \phi \) as a parameter, whereas it is actually a function with its own hyper-parameter \( \alpha \).
It would be valuable to include validation or test results for a few tasks to better demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method. Since the regularizer is introduced as an additional cost function, its impact on validation/test performance should be explicitly reported. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on how they selected the hyper-parameters for their experiments.
Figures 2 and 3 contribute little to the paper and are difficult to interpret. They should either be improved or removed. Moreover, the figures in Section 3.4.2 lack proper labels and captions. Many of these figures are too small, with unreadable labels, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights.
A small question:
- Do you also backpropagate through \( \tilde{\mW}_i^t \)?
