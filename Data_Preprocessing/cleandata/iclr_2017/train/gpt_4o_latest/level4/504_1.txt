The paper attempts to take an initial step toward addressing the challenging problem of "learning from a limited number of demonstrations." It proposes three main contributions in this direction:  
1. Unsupervised segmentation of videos to identify intermediate steps in a process.  
2. Definition of a reward function based on feature selection for each sub-task.  
Pros:  
+ The paper represents a novel attempt to tackle a highly challenging problem, where a robot is taught real-world tasks using very few visual demonstrations and without additional retraining.  
+ The approach is well-motivated, leveraging priors learned from object classification tasks (via deep network features) to address the issue of limited training examples.  
+ As shown in Fig. 3, the reward functions appear more interpretable and align with transitions between subtasks.  
+ Decomposing a video into subtasks enables a demonstration-based method to achieve performance comparable to a fully instrumented approach for complex real-world tasks, such as door opening.  
Cons:  
1. While unsupervised video segmentation is a promising starting point for identifying subtasks, there is a substantial body of prior work in this area that should be cited and compared against. Specifically, video shot detection and shot segmentation methods aim to identify abrupt changes in videos to segment them into visually distinct shots. These approaches could be enhanced with CNN-based features.

2. The authors state that they did not find it necessary to identify commonalities across demonstrations. However, this significantly narrows the scope of the problem and imposes strict constraints on the demonstrations. It is worth noting that prior work (e.g., video co-segmentation by Tang et al., ECCV 2014) has utilized such commonalities for unsupervised video segmentation.  
3. The paper evaluates the unsupervised temporal video segmentation approach against a simple random baseline on a limited set of sample videos. Given the extensive literature in this domain, these experiments are insufficient to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed method.  
4. The authors hypothesize that "sparse independent features exist which can discriminate a wide range of unseen inputs" and incorporate this intuition into their feature selection strategy. However, the validity of this hypothesis is not adequately demonstrated through experiments. For example, a comparison with a simple linear classifier for subtasks would have provided valuable insights.  
Overall:  
The paper introduces a straightforward approach based on the idea that recognizing sub-goals in an unsupervised manner can facilitate learning from a limited number of visual demonstrations. This is a well-motivated first step toward solving a difficult problem. However, the methods and claims presented in the paper require more rigorous analysis and comparison with stronger baselines to establish their significance.
