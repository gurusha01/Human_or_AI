The authors present a recurrent variational neural network framework for modeling volatility in financial time series. Their approach applies the VRNN model of Chung et al. (2015) to volatility forecasting, employing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure that is iteratively applied at each time step of the series.
The manuscript is well-written and generally easy to follow, though this reviewer recommends running a spell check, as the paper contains a few minor typographical errors.
The primary technical contribution of the paper lies in introducing a two-level recurrence structure: one for the latent process and another for the observables. While this is a novel, albeit modest, contribution, the broader methodological impact is more significant. The work addresses time series modeling in a domain of substantial practical importance, which has traditionally relied on rigid functional forms. Demonstrating the utility of general-purpose non-linear models for volatility forecasting could have far-reaching implications.
That said, I have several comments and concerns regarding the paper:
1) While the authors do not explicitly state it, their framework appears to focus on one-step-ahead volatility forecasts. However, many practical applications, such as derivative pricing, require forecasts over longer horizons. It would be valuable to discuss how the proposed model could be adapted for multi-step-ahead forecasting.
2) In Section 4.4, the authors assert that a GARCH(1,1) model is conditionally deterministic. This is accurate only for one-step-ahead forecasts. For longer horizons, GARCH(1,1) volatility forecasts are no longer deterministic, and this distinction should be clarified.
3) Initially, I found the experimental validation lacking, as it was limited to comparisons with a baseline GARCH model. However, the revised version includes additional comparisons, which improve the quality of the results. That said, the models used for comparison are not state-of-the-art. The authors are encouraged to explore R packages such as `stochvol` and `fGarch`, which provide implementations of various models that could serve as more robust baselines. This would strengthen the evidence that the proposed model offers meaningful improvements over existing approaches in the finance literature.
4) Section 5.2 would benefit from additional details about the network architecture, such as the number of hidden units and the embedding dimension \( D_E \) (as referenced in Section 5.4).
5) Section 5.3 should provide more information about the data-generating process used in the synthetic data experiments.
6) Some results in the appendix are perplexing. Specifically, in Figure 4(b) and (c), the model exhibits significant drops in volatility around jumps in the price series (e.g., at time steps 1300 and 1600), where one would expect volatility to spike. This behavior warrants further explanation and discussion.
Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of volatility modeling. Despite some shortcomings, it serves as a promising starting point for exploring the broader application of neural time series models within the financial domain.
