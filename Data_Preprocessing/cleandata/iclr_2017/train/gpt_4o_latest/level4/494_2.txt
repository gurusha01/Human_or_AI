The authors introduce a method for dataset extraction, a corresponding dataset, and initial compelling results aimed at advancing machine-learning-assisted higher-order logic theorem proving. The experimental outcomes are remarkably strong for a baseline, achieving a relevance classification accuracy exceeding 0.83, which is significantly better than random chance, and they provide a solid foundation for further exploration in this area. The paper is clearly written, with well-structured arguments, leaving minimal grounds for critique. The related work appears to be comprehensively addressed, though I should mention that I am not a specialist in automated theorem proving.
