This paper introduces a method for simultaneously learning both a model and an inference procedure using recurrent neural networks, specifically in the context of inverse problems.  
The proposed approach is compelling, and the results are quite promising. Additionally, the paper is well-written and clearly presented.  
I would, however, appreciate some discussion on what the network actually learns about natural images in the case of denoising. For instance, what do the learned filters look like? Is the network particularly sensitive to specific image structures, such as edges? Furthermore, how is the state in the recurrent unit utilized? When are the gates active or inactive, and what governs their behavior?  
Despite these questions, I believe this is a solid piece of work that deserves acceptance.
