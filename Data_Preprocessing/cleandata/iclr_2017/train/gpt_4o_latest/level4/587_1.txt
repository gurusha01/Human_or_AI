One of the central ideas presented in this paper is substituting pooling layers with stride-2 convolutions and subsequently retraining the model. The authors integrate this approach into a new layer and label it as a novel type of layer. This characterization is highly misleading and contributes unnecessary confusion to the field. Moreover, the use of strided convolutions as a replacement for pooling is not a novel concept (e.g.
