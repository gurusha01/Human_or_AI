This paper introduces a heuristic aimed at mitigating the recurrence of large negative rewards by encapsulating such experiences into a "danger model." The manuscript is well-crafted and even incorporates some notably vivid and evocative language [*].
The proposed heuristic is tested in two simplified toy domains. However, a more robust evaluation would likely involve using a widely recognized benchmark, such as Atari. The Atari suite seems particularly suitable, as its games inherently feature numerous catastrophic events (e.g., sudden failures or "deaths").
[*] Memorable excerpts from the paper, as appreciated by this reviewer:
"Imagine a self-driving car that had to periodically hit a few pedestrians in order to remember that it's undesirable."
"The child can learn to adjust its behaviour without actually having to stab someone."
"... the catastrophe lurking just past the optimal shave."
