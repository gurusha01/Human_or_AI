Paraphrased Review:
This paper makes a valuable contribution to advancing tractable image modeling. Specifically, the proposed improvements to autoregressive models address the challenge of slow test-time performance, and the more efficient architectures introduced here are likely to mitigate this issue.
However, my primary concern lies in the insufficient discussion of related work. Mixture models have been extensively utilized in autoregressive image modeling, including for multivariate conditional densities and for increasing receptive field size through downsampling, though implemented differently. Relevant prior works include Domke (2008), Hosseini et al. (2010), Theis et al. (2012), Uria et al. (2013), and Theis et al. (2015). Additionally, it is worth noting that the logistic distribution is a specific instance of the Gaussian scale mixture (West, 1978).
The key distinction in this paper appears to be the integration of the density to handle integer-valued data. While this is undoubtedly a promising and appropriate direction, the authors claim—without providing evidence—that earlier models using continuous distributions faced issues due to the lack of this integration. The authors should elaborate on this claim, include supporting references, or ideally, provide experimental results showing the performance of PixelCNN++ without integration (e.g., by adding uniform noise to make the variables continuous).
Given the high dimensionality of the data, 60,000 images is a relatively small dataset. While the use of regularization is understandable for specialized datasets—and this serves as a good demonstration of dropout's utility—why not leverage the "80 Million Tiny Images" dataset, which is a superset of CIFAR-10, for experiments on natural images? Semi-supervised learning should be straightforward in this context, as the model's likelihood is tractable, and this larger dataset could also be applied in the class-conditional case.
Finally, it would be valuable to report the test-time speeds of the different models, particularly for image generation tasks.
