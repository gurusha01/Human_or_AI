In this work, the authors propose a referential game involving two agents. Both agents are presented with two images. The first agent, referred to as the sender, receives a binary target variable (t) and is tasked with sending a symbol (message) to the second agent, referred to as the receiver, enabling the latter to recover the target. A reward is given to both agents if the receiver successfully predicts the target. The paper introduces a framework where the agents are parameterized as neural networks, leveraging pretrained image representations as feature vectors, and are trained using the REINFORCE algorithm. Within this setup, the authors demonstrate that the agents converge to optimal policies and that the symbolic communication learned by the agents (i.e., the message sent from the sender to the receiver) encodes meaningful concepts. Furthermore, the paper includes experiments on a variant of the game grounded in different image classes, where the agents appear to learn even more meaningful concepts. Lastly, the authors propose a multi-game setup in which the sender alternates between playing the referential game and performing a supervised learning task (image classification). As expected, when the symbolic communication is anchored to the supervised learning task, the resulting representations exhibit even more meaningful concepts.
Exploring shared representations for communication in a multi-agent framework is an intriguing research direction. This problem is significantly more challenging than standard supervised learning or single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, which justifies the authors' choice to begin with a relatively simple task. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed approach of first learning communication between agents and subsequently grounding this communication in human language is novel. As the authors suggest, this could serve as an alternative paradigm to traditional sequence-to-sequence models, which often emphasize the statistical properties of language over its functional aspects. I believe the proposed task and framework, along with the analysis and visualization of the learned symbolic communication, represent a valuable contribution that can serve as a foundation for future research. For these reasons, I recommend accepting the paper.
Additional comments:
- How is the target variable (t) incorporated into the sender network? Please clarify this in the paper.
- The use of percentage (%) values in Table 1 and Table 2 appears inconsistent. In Table 1, percentages are expressed in the range [0, 100], whereas in Table 2, they seem to be in the range [0, 1]. Please standardize this. Additionally, in Table 1, the column "obs-chance purity" seems to contain extremely small values. Could this be a mistake?
