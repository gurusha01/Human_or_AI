This paper presents a parallel approach to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. Both works share the core idea of incorporating an autoencoder into the discriminator to enhance the stability and performance of GANs. Unlike Denoising Feature Matching, however, EBGAN employs an encoder-decoder architecture instead of focusing solely on denoising and replaces the original loss function with hinge loss.
The theoretical contributions are solid, and the empirical results, particularly for high-resolution images, stand out as a unique achievement among recent advancements in GANs.
I recommend including Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching as related work.
