SYNOPSIS:  
The paper presents an efficient approximation to the softmax function aimed at accelerating its computation on GPUs. The authors exploit the unbalanced distribution of words and specific empirical GPU matrix multiplication timings to develop an algorithm that optimally clusters the vocabulary. Their empirical results demonstrate notable speedups over competing methods, while maintaining accuracy close to that of the full softmax.
THOUGHTS:  
Given that the primary objective of this work is to accelerate training, I wonder why the authors only compare their method to the flat 2-level hierarchical softmax (HSM), which offers an O(âˆšV) speedup at best, and not to the deeper binary-tree HSM, which achieves an O(log V) speedup at best.
Overall, the paper is well-written, clear, and easy to follow, aside from a few minor notation issues raised by other reviewers. It provides an intriguing addition to the language modeling toolkit. The proposed method builds on prior work aimed at optimizing vocabulary clustering to balance the tradeoff between speed and accuracy, which is a common challenge with hierarchical approaches. The key contribution here appears to be that the clustering objective successfully achieves its intended goal of improving speed, while also unexpectedly preserving accuracy. Although the authors do not discuss potential reasons for this latter observation, I suspect it is due to the flat region in the timing graph (Figure 1), which allows the head group \( Vh \) to encompass a substantial fraction of the most frequent words in the vocabulary without incurring additional cost. This reduces the approximation error (i.e., regions where \( P\text{approx}(\text{next} | \text{previous}) \) lacks support compared to \( P_\text{real} \)), thereby mitigating the impact on perplexity relative to the full softmax.
That said, since the proposed method is closely related to the speed-optimal approach introduced by Zweig et al. (2013) (albeit without explicit GPU-specific optimizations), I believe a direct comparison with that method is necessary. I understand such a comparison is in progress, and if the reported speed and accuracy gains remain consistent, I would be inclined to revise my rating to a 7.
