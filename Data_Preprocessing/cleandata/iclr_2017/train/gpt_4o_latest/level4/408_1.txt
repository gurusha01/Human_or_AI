Pros:  
- The training criterion is intriguing and well-conceived.  
Cons:  
- The work lacks baselines grounded in established ASR techniques.  
Comments:  
- The dataset size is relatively limited.  
- Including ROC curves for detection and additional metrics, such as EER, could enhance the evaluation beyond just AP.  
- A more thorough analysis of the results is needed, such as comparing the precision for words encountered during training with the detection performance for out-of-vocabulary words.  
- Scatter plots illustrating the relationship between embeddings and orthographic distances would provide valuable insights.
