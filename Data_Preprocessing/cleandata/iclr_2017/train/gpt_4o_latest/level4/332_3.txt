This paper follows a fairly standard approach by employing deep metric learning within a Siamese architecture. However, its exploration of connections to human perception, particularly the concept of persistence, is quite intriguing. While I am not an expert in human vision, the overall comparison and, more specifically, the induced hierarchical groupings appear to be aspects that could capture the interest of this community. The experimental setup is adequate, but I found it disappointing that the evaluation relies entirely on synthetic data. Incorporating even a minimally viable real-world dataset, such as ALOI, would have strengthened the work.
