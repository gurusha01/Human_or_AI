This paper reports experimental results using an EdgeBoxes + Fast R-CNN detector for pedestrian localization. The approach employs an AlexNet (CaffeNet) backbone architecture, modified to incorporate batch normalization. Results are demonstrated on the INRIA and ETH datasets.
Pros  
- The paper is well-written and straightforward to follow.
Cons  
- The contributions of the paper are too minor to justify publication.  
- The experimental evaluation lacks coverage of key datasets, such as the Caltech pedestrian dataset and ideally the KITTI pedestrian dataset as well.  
- The paper fails to cite or discuss recent work from ECCV 2016 [a], which offers superior results and a more comprehensive experimental evaluation.  
My rating primarily reflects the limited significance of the contributions. The first claimed contribution is the use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection. Unless this choice leads to a particularly surprising or impactful experimental result, it is too incremental to be considered a meaningful contribution. Furthermore, if this choice is indeed critical, the paper should substantiate it by demonstrating that other proposal methods (beyond Selective Search and EdgeBoxes, as there are many alternatives) perform worse in terms of metrics such as speed, accuracy, or memory usage.  
The second claimed contribution is the incorporation of batch normalization (BN) into the network architecture. While it is true that BN has not been extensively explored in Fast R-CNN, the paper's narrow focus on pedestrian detection limits the generalizability of this contribution. A more compelling approach would be to evaluate BN + Fast R-CNN on broader object detection tasks, such as those in PASCAL VOC or COCO, where well-established Fast R-CNN baselines exist. Restricting the study to pedestrian detection provides limited insight into the broader implications of using BN in this context.  
Additionally, there are potential technical concerns that are not addressed. BN is typically avoided in Fast R-CNN because the effective batch size seen by most layers of the network is usually only one or two images, which is likely insufficient for the naive application of BN. This issue warrants discussion and justification in the paper.
