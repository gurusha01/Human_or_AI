This paper is clearly written and effectively presented. The proposed method leverages a denoising autoencoder to learn an implicit probability distribution, which contributes to reducing the complexity of trainingâ€”a commendable approach. In my opinion, the joint training with an autoencoder offers additional auxiliary gradient information that enhances the generator's performance. Utilizing auxiliary information could serve as a potential strategy to improve GANs.
Additional comment:  
I recommend including a more detailed discussion on EBGAN in the next version.
