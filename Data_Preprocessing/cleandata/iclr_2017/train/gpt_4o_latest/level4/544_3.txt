This paper develops a physics simulator using Theano and leverages it to train a neural network policy by backpropagating gradients through the simulation. The approach is innovative and is motivated by its potential to enable policy learning for robotics applications.
My two primary concerns with the paper are as follows:  
1. While the method is motivated by robotics policy learning, its applicability to robotics hinges on the ability to transfer the learned policy to the real world. Policy transfer from simulation to the real world remains an open research challenge, particularly when using simulators that lack realism.  
2. The key novelty and advantage of this approach over other model-based methods is the differentiability of the simulator. However, the paper only provides an empirical comparison with a model-free approach (CMA-ES). To properly validate the method, it should be compared against other model-based approaches that do not rely on analytic derivatives of the model.
To provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of the method, the paper should also include a quantitative comparison of the proposed simulator's computational speed against that of standard simulation platforms.
Given the novelty and promise of the idea, I believe the paper meets the acceptance threshold. However, it would benefit significantly from addressing the aforementioned comparisons.
Finally, the paper's writing could be improved, as it is somewhat informal and imprecise in several places. Here are some examples:  
- "we model the use of a neural network as a general controller for a robot" could be more concisely expressed as "we model the robot controller using a neural network" or "the robot controller is modeled using a neural network."  
- "In previous research, finding a gradient…" is a run-on sentence.  
- "We basically jam this entire equation into" is informal and imprecise.  
- "deep learning neural network" should omit the word "learning."  
- "one big RNN, where we unfold over time" should be revised to "…RNN, which we unfold over time" or "…RNN, unfolded over time."  
Additionally, the writing would benefit from being more concise and ensuring the paper fits within the 8-page limit.
