This study introduces the use of gradient visualizations to enhance the understanding of feature (i.e., pixel) importance in visual classification tasks. While the presented visualizations are intriguing, the methodology appears somewhat ad hoc. The authors do not provide a clear rationale for why visualizing standard gradients fails to correlate with the importance of features relevant to the target visual category, leading them to adopt the interior gradient approach.
A specific question arises regarding standard gradients at features that constitute the spatial support of the visual class. Do the gradients of features associated with confident predictions remain low, whereas those linked to high uncertainty exhibit stronger gradients?
Regarding the interior gradients, it is not evident how the scaling parameter \(\alpha\) influences feature importance or how it connects to attention mechanisms.
Lastly, does the proposed model incorporate batch normalization?
