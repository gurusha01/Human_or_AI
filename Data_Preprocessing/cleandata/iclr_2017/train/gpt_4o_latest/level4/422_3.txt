The paper explores the application of the well-established SVGB in a sequential setting, as has been done in several prior works. However, the authors introduce explicit state space constraints akin to those in Linear Gaussian Models: a Markovian latent space and conditional independence of observed variables given the latent variables. In this case, the model is non-linear. These assumptions are thoughtfully justified by the aim of deriving meaningful latent variables.
The experiments are engaging, but I remain somewhat unconvinced by the regression results presented in Figure 3. Specifically, it is unclear why one could not extract the angle and velocity from the state using a function more expressive than a linear one. Additionally, the omission of the model from (Watter et al., 2015) warrants explanation.
Upon revisiting the paper, I find the rationale for combining the coordinates into a 3x3 checkerboard, as described in Figure 5a, unclear. 
Overall, the paper is well-motivated, and the proposed model demonstrates sufficient novelty. However, the bouncing ball experiment is less compelling, particularly in prediction tasks, given that the problem is fully determined by the initial velocity and position.
