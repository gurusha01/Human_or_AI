The paper introduces an amortised MAP estimation approach for super-resolution (SR) problems. By training a neural network to project onto an affine subspace of SR solutions that remain consistent with the low-resolution (LR) method, the approach facilitates the discovery of valid solutions using various techniques, including GANs, noise-assisted, and density-assisted optimization.  
The results are effectively demonstrated across multiple datasets.  
Overall, I appreciate the paper; however, I believe the writing could benefit from significant refinement, and the presentation should be made more coherent. At times, the content was difficult to follow, and given the complexity of the subject, improving clarity would be highly beneficial. Additionally, I would like to see a deeper analysis of the resulting networksâ€”what types of features do they learn?
