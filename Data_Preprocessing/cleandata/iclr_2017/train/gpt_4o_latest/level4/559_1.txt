The paper builds upon the matching networks introduced by Vinyals et al. in NIPS2016. Rather than utilizing all examples in the support set during testing, the proposed approach represents each class using the mean of its learned embeddings. The training process and experimental setup closely resemble those of the original matching networks. However, I am not entirely convinced of the advantages this method offers over the original matching networks. In the 1-shot scenario, the two methods appear equivalent, as a single example in the class means the embedding itself serves as the mean. In the 5-shot scenario, the original matching networks compute a weighted average of all examples, which incurs at most 5x computational cost. The experimental results for prototypical networks show only marginal improvements over matching networks. While I find the extension to be simple, straightforward, and novel, I remain unconvinced of its clear advantages.
