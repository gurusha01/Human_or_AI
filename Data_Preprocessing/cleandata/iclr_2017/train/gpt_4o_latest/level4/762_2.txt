I appreciate the concept that this paper seeks to investigate. However, I have identified several concerns regarding the analysis:
- To better assess the quality of the results, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods (e.g., by averaging d × d pixel patches and applying a denoising autoencoder). If these methods significantly outperform the proposed model, it would suggest that the model is not fully leveraging all the information available in the input image.
- SCT-R and FOV-R are designed to evaluate how much information can be reconstructed using only the Fovea versus the Fovea combined with low-resolution periphery. However, there is an additional distinction between these two conditions: as described in the paper, SCT-R involves setting part of the image to zero, whereas in FOV-R, this part is entirely removed. With a shallow architecture (e.g., one or two hidden layers), this difference could plausibly affect the results.
- On page 4, the paper compares the performance of FOV-R (1% error) with DS-D (1.5%) and attributes the improvement to the autoencoder extracting peripheral information from the Fovea. While this may be true, part of the reduced error likely stems from the Fovea being (presumably) perfectly reconstructed. To directly address the question of "how much additional information about the periphery can be extracted from the Fovea," the authors should consider calculating the error exclusively in the periphery—i.e., the region of the image where DS-D and FOV-R received identical input. This would isolate the contribution of the Fovea to the reduced error.
Additional concerns:
- The images in Figure 2 (a) and (b) for the rows labeled "factor 2," "factor 4," and "factor 8" appear excessively blurry, suggesting some form of interpolation is being applied (albeit slightly different from bilinear interpolation). This makes it challenging to evaluate the information content in these images. It would be far more informative to display them using "nearest" interpolation.
- The caption for Figure 3 is too vague. Consider adding more detail, perhaps similar to what is provided in footnote 2.
- Figures often appear too early in the paper, creating significant gaps between the text and the corresponding figures. This disrupts the flow and readability of the paper.
