Previous studies utilize a data-derived adjacency matrix (A) to identify neighbors, which serve as the basis for graph convolution. The authors propose extending the neighbor set by including nodes reachable within i â‰¤ k steps in the graph. This introduces an additional tunable parameter, k, which requires justification compared to the established k = 1 approach. In one of their experiments (Merk), the results indicate that k = 1 performed better. However, they do not specify the exact value of k used, only mentioning that it was large enough to yield p = 5 nodes as neighbors. In the second experiment (MNIST), they conducted their analysis using k = 1, consistent with the approach proposed by prior work (Coates & Ng, 2011). A more compelling evaluation would involve directly comparing k = 1 to k > 1 and demonstrating that the latter provides sufficient improvement to warrant the introduction of an additional hyperparameter.
