The paper introduces a method for learning shared neural representations of temporal abstractions in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) using actor-critic techniques. This approach is demonstrated on two tasks: a gridworld environment with objects and a simplified Minecraft scenario. The concept of leveraging symbolic task descriptions to learn corresponding "implementations" is intriguing, and the empirical results are encouraging. However, there are two significant limitations in the current version of this work. 
First, the ideas underpinning this paper—such as symbolic specifications, actor-critic methods, and shared representations—have been explored extensively in prior research. While the paper includes a discussion of related work, it remains unclear what is novel about this contribution. The main innovation of this work, beyond offering a new implementation of established ideas within a deep learning framework, needs to be explicitly articulated and emphasized. 
Second, the proposed approach heavily depends on curriculum learning, as evidenced by the experiments. Although the authors claim that specifying tasks using simplified symbolic language is straightforward, designing an effective curriculum could be quite complex, particularly for more challenging tasks. The examples provided are relatively small in scale, and the paper does not address how curricula might be constructed for larger, more complex problems. Given the approach's sensitivity to the curriculum, this limitation reduces its broader applicability. Furthermore, it is unclear whether supervision could be automated rather than relying on prior domain knowledge.
Minor comments:
- The experimental setup is not described in sufficient detail within the paper. While sharing GitHub code is commendable, the paper itself should justify the choices made in the task design (e.g., were these decisions optimized, or were they the first configurations that worked?). Without such explanations, the experiments, even with the provided code, are not fully reproducible.
- The description of the method is closely intertwined with specific algorithmic choices, making it difficult to generalize. The authors could consider abstracting their approach to a more formalized framework, which might also clarify its relationship to prior work.
