The paper establishes several connections between image representations in state-of-the-art object recognition networks and findings from human visual psychophysics:
1) It demonstrates that the mean L1 distance in the feature space of specific CNN layers can predict human noise-detection thresholds in natural images.  
2) It shows that for three distinct 2-AFC tasks, where one condition is hard and the other is easy for humans, the mutual information between decision labels and quantized CNN activations tends to be higher in the condition that is easier for humans.  
3) It replicates the general bandpass nature of contrast/frequency detection sensitivity observed in humans.  
While these findings are intriguing, they appear somewhat anecdotal, and some seem relatively straightforward (e.g., the findings in 2). To make the claims more compelling, it is essential to investigate which specific aspects of the CNN contribute to the reported results. A potential approach to address this would be to incorporate robust baseline models for comparison. As previously mentioned, one such baseline could be a reasonable low-level vision model. Another promising direction would involve comparing the results across different training stages of the same network.  
This approach could help disentangle which parts of the findings can be attributed to simple low-level image processing mechanisms, which are due to the general architecture of deep networks, and which stem from the advanced computational capabilities (e.g., object recognition performance) of CNNs.  
In summary, while establishing correspondences between state-of-the-art CNNs and human vision is a promising avenue, it is critical to demonstrate that the observed correspondences are non-trivial and arise from meaningful aspects of the CNN. This was not adequately addressed in the paper, limiting its contribution. As a result, it remains unclear whether the findings reveal a unique relationship between high-performing CNNs and the human visual system.  
UPDATE:  
Thank you for the thorough revision and for incorporating several of the suggested baselines. The inclusion of these baselines has added depth to the analysis. While the results from the baseline models often introduce additional questions and complicate the interpretation, this reflects the inherent complexity of the topic and enhances the overall value of the work.  
One additional suggestion: The experiments with the snapshots of CaffeNet indicate that the direct relationship between CNN performance and the prediction accuracy of biological vision, as established in Yamins et al. 2014 and Cadieu et al. 2014, does not necessarily hold in your experiments. I believe this discrepancy warrants discussion in the paper.  
Overall, the revised paper now represents a solid contribution to the study of connections between state-of-the-art CNNs and human psychophysics. I am now inclined to recommend its acceptance.  
I raise my rating for this paper to 7.
