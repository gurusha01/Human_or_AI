The paper introduces a method for simultaneously predicting motion and classifying activities from sequences, with two distinct applications: the motion of fruit flies and online handwriting recognition.
The approach employs a classical encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by skip connections that facilitate direct communication between the encoder and decoder at corresponding abstraction levels. Motion is treated as a classification task by discretizing it, and the model is trained using a combination of classification loss and motion prediction loss. The latter loss is intended to be utilized in a semi-supervised setting for data segments lacking action labels.
While the concept of leveraging predictions to train feature representations for discrimination is not novel, the paper incorporates a few intriguing ideas, some of which are partially inspired by work in other domains.
My primary concern lies with the experimental evaluation. The experimental section includes numerous figures that qualitatively illustrate the model's learning outcomes. However, quantitative evaluation is relatively sparse.
- For the fruit fly application, the authors compare classification performance against a previously published method by the first author.
- Again, in the fruit fly application, the performance improvement in motion prediction shown in Figure 5c appears modest compared to the baseline. It is unclear whether this improvement is statistically significant.
- I did not observe any evaluation results for the handwriting recognition application. Was this aspect of the work not assessed?
Figure 5a is challenging to interpret and lacks clarity. Additionally, the term "BesNet" is introduced here without any prior explanation.
Figure 4 seems to convey multiple, distinct narratives. I recommend dividing it into at least two separate figures for better clarity.
The statement "Animal behavior is nondeterministic" feels like an overgeneralization, as it depends on the frame of reference. I suggest rephrasing it to indicate that we lack access to the underlying cognitive processes, which makes the behavior appear nondeterministic given the information currently available.
Finally, I have a question: given that the behavior model is nondeterministic, would a GAN be a more natural choice for the predictive component of this task?
