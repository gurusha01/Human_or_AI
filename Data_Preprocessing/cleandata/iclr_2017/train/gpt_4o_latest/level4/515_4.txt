The paper presents a tensor factorization approach, known as Tensor Train (TT), for modeling feature interactions in supervised classification tasks. Tensor Train represents tensors of arbitrary dimensions using low-rank matrix products, with the rank serving as a parameter to control the approximation's complexity. The authors conduct experiments on various datasets for binary classification problems.
The primary contribution of the paper lies in showcasing how the TT framework, originally developed by one of the authors, can be adapted to model feature interactions. An additional contribution is the introduction of a gradient-based algorithm that leverages the geometrical structure of the factorization. These concepts appear to be novel within the field of machine learning. The algorithm itself exhibits reasonable computational complexity for inference and seems adaptable to large-scale problems, although the experiments presented do not explore such scenarios.
The experimental section, however, is underdeveloped and could benefit from significant improvements. Key details about the datasets, such as their characteristics, are missing. Performance metrics across the datasets are not consistently reported. While each dataset is used to highlight specific aspects of the model, the inclusion of classification performance and comparisons with baseline methods across all experiments would strengthen the evaluation. For the two UCI datasets, the authors provide optimization performance on the training set, but similar results on the test sets are needed to assess the algorithm's generalization capabilities. The comparison with other methods (Section 8.4) is limited to synthetic data, which, while designed to emphasize feature interactions, do not reflect a broad range of real-world scenarios. This limitation also applies to the analysis of Dropout. The comparison on the Movielens dataset is insufficiently detailed, and all experiments are restricted to small-scale problems.
In summary, the paper offers original contributions that have the potential to merit publication. However, the experimental evaluation is incomplete and lacks conclusive evidence. A more comprehensive comparison with competing methods, such as Factorization Machines, would further enhance the paper's impact.
