This paper proposes integrating LSTMs, trained on a large MIDI dataset, with a handcrafted reward function designed to fine-tune the model in a musically meaningful manner. The concept of leveraging handcrafted rewards in this way is innovative and holds promise for practical applications, particularly in scenarios where musicians might prefer to define a set of rules rather than directly crafting melodies.
While some of the design choices appear somewhat ad-hoc and simplistic from a music-theoretical standpoint, the results do seem to represent an improvement over the note RNN baseline. However, it remains unclear how representative these results are or whether they were selectively chosen. I am skeptical about the scalability of this approach to more complex reward functions that would be required for composing fully-fledged music. Perhaps LSTMs are not the most suitable model for this task, especially if they struggle to generate pleasing melodies despite being trained on a relatively large dataset. Are there no alternative differentiable models that might perform better? For instance, could dilated convolution-based approaches be explored?
One aspect I find problematic is the characterization of the short melodies as "compositions," as they fall far short of meaningful music and lack polyphony. It would be beneficial if papers like this were developed with input or feedback from individuals with formal musical training, who could provide a more critical perspective on such details.
On the positive side, I appreciate the authors' effort to analyze and interpret their results; for example, Table 1 is quite insightful. However, Figure 3 would have been more effective if it included real melody excerpts using the same sound synthesis or sample setup. Additionally, the paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the method's limitations.
In conclusion, I find the paper and its central idea appealing, and I can see how reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning approaches like this could be valuable for musicians. While the novelty may be somewhat limited, the paper provides a useful guide for achieving practical results in this domain.
