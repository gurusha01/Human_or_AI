1. The QA model lacks novelty and appears to be highly similar to existing models.  
2. The IQA model is difficult to understand. If human interaction is required during the training process, it raises concerns about practicality, as it seems unrealistic to involve humans in every training iteration. On the other hand, if the interactive questions are predefined, the approach cannot truly be considered interactive, as it would not adapt to the model's current output state.
