This paper introduces a network design called Gated Residual Networks, which incorporates gating mechanisms into shortcut connections using a scalar to control the gate. The authors assert that this design enhances the training of Residual Networks.
The authors demonstrate competitive performance on CIFAR-10 compared to state-of-the-art models, using only Wide ResNets. However, the Wide Gated ResNet requires significantly more parameters than DenseNet (and other ResNet variants) to achieve marginal improvements over DenseNet. Crucially, while the authors claim to achieve the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the updated DenseNet-BC (Huang et al., 2016b) achieves superior results (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters). Even with 15.3M parameters—far fewer than the 36.5M used by the proposed method—DenseNet-BC still outperforms the proposed approach. Furthermore, state-of-the-art ResNet variants report results on ImageNet, and the empirical evaluation here would benefit from similar ImageNet results to substantiate the claimed improvements.
The proposed method draws on concepts from Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks with a clear and intuitive motivation. However, the novelty is limited, and the empirical results fail to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of this incremental approach.
- Regarding the statement "assume that the squared parameter-wise distance between ... surrogate to the paths length," could the authors elaborate further? Why is this assumption valid? 
- Why are the mean and variance substituted with initialization mean and variance in the derivation of Equations 15 and 16?
- Concerning "A comparison of the Total Squared Distance to Identity...," where is the actual comparison presented?
- Why are there no results for Highway Neural Networks in Table 5?
- In Table 5, why does He et al. (2015b) report a value of 6.61, which does not align with the 6.43 reported in their paper?
- Regarding the statement, "Our results don't surpass the state-of-the-art, which was expected considering the hardware limitations. However, taking into account the improvement observed when augmenting a smaller Wide ResNet, we believe that the technique proposed can be used to surpass the state-of-the-art," how can the authors claim potential improvements over baselines in the final comparison without concrete evidence? While this may serve as a sanity check during empirical work, it does not substantiate the claim.
- Baselines include results on ImageNet. To enable a satisfactory comparison, are there any ImageNet results available for the proposed method? If not, this omission limits the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
