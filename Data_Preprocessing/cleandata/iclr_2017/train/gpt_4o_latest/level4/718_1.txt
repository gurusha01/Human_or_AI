The authors propose a multiagent system as a generalization of neural networks. This system is designed to operate more efficiently with less restrictive network structures by performing only the necessary computations within the graph. However, I do not see a significant distinction between the proposed system and the existing framework of artificial neural networks. While current neural network architectures often rely heavily on matrix-matrix multiplications, they are not inherently constrained to such designs. In essence, the proposed multiagent system could be interpreted as a neural network with more complex layer or connectivity structures, where each neuron is treated as a layer. The claimed computational efficiency is demonstrated only in the context of sparsely connected denoising autoencoders within the multiagent system framework. However, the baseline comparison should instead be made against fully connected neural networks that utilize matrix-matrix multiplication.
