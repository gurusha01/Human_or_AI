The paper presents a modification to the CNN-based texture synthesis approach of Gatys et al., incorporating the matching of correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations between feature responses at the same spatial positions within the feature maps. 
The authors assert that this modification:  
a) enhances texture synthesis for textures with long-range regular structures, which are not well-preserved using the Gatys et al. method,  
b) improves performance on texture inpainting tasks relative to the Gatys et al. method,  
c) yields better results in season transfer when integrated with the style transfer method of Gatys et al., and  
d) enables the preservation of symmetry properties around the flipping axis by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps.  
I concur with claim a). However, the synthesized textures still exhibit certain artifacts, such as greyish regions, indicating that the problem remains only partially addressed. Moreover, the proposed approach is computationally expensive, further slowing down an already time-intensive texture synthesis process. For instance, in comparison, the concurrent work by Liu et al. (
