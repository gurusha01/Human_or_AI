Review - Description:  
This paper investigates whether shallow networks with an equivalent number of parameters can match the performance of deep convolutional networks without compromising accuracy. The study is conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset, where shallow student networks are trained using L2 regression on the logit outputs of deep convolutional teacher networks. The findings indicate that achieving comparable accuracy within the same parameter budget is only feasible when multiple convolutional layers are employed.  
Strong Points:  
- The experiments are meticulously conducted with careful hyperparameter tuning.  
- The paper presents intriguing findings that partially challenge the conclusions of prior work in this domain (Ba and Caruana, 2014).  
- The writing is clear, concise, and easy to follow.  
Weak Points:  
- CIFAR-10, with its 10 classes, remains a relatively simple dataset. It would be valuable to evaluate the approach on a more complex dataset, such as ImageNet, to determine whether the findings hold for tasks with a larger number of classes.  
Originality:  
- While this is primarily an experimental study, the research question is compelling and merits exploration. The results are robust and contribute novel insights to the field.  
Quality:  
- The experimental methodology is rigorous and well-executed.  
Clarity:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated.  
Significance:  
- The results challenge certain conclusions from earlier studies, making this work an important contribution that warrants publication and further discussion.  
Overall:  
This is a well-executed experimental study with noteworthy findings. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are robust.
