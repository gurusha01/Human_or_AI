The authors present a novel memory model that achieves memory access in O(log n) time.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, and the concepts are presented with clarity.
- The proposed model is innovative, and I am not aware of any existing models that are similar.
- The issue of memory access time for longer sequences is well-motivated, and the paper clearly demonstrates how the proposed model addresses this challenge.
Weaknesses:
- While the motivation for achieving O(log n) access time is to enable the model's application to very long sequences, it is unclear whether the model will generalize effectively to such sequences. Although the low computation time is evident from the model's design, its practical scalability remains uncertain.
- The model has not been evaluated on any real-world tasks.
I recommend including experiments to demonstrate the model's performance on long sequences and real-world tasks. Without such evidence, the practical utility of the model remains ambiguous.
