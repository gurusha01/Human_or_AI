The paper explores an alternative approach to ternary quantization of weights.
Strengths:
1. The paper demonstrates performance improvements compared to existing methods.
2. The concept of learning the quantization process, rather than relying on pre-defined, human-designed algorithms, is innovative and aligns well with contemporary trends in machine learning.
Weaknesses:
1. The contribution of the paper is highly incremental.
2. The target audience for the paper is quite narrow. It assumes that readers are already familiar with prior work on ternary quantization. As such, it serves more as an update on recent developments in the field rather than a standalone contribution. The explanation of the main algorithm is extremely brief, making it accessible primarily to those who have prior knowledge of this specialized area, but less so to the broader deep learning community.
3. The work lacks a compelling motivation. The presented approach appears to be an engineering refinement, which could be valuable if it were demonstrated to have practical utility in real-world applications. However, the paper does not convincingly establish the necessity of this refinement. Are there specific practical use cases that demand this level of improvement? The justification that it is "related to mobile, therefore it is cool" seems insufficient.
Overall, this paper represents a minor advancement in a niche area of research. Without a stronger practical motivation for pursuing this particular line of work or a clearer demonstration of its broader impact, I do not believe it is a suitable fit for ICLR, which caters to a diverse and wide-ranging audience.
Additionally, it appears that the code has not been made publicly available.
