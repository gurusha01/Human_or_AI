The paper is well-written and presents an intriguing constructionâ€”I genuinely enjoyed reading it.
However, I found the formalism somewhat challenging to follow without concrete examples. Specifically, it was not immediately clear what the individual components in Figure 1A represented. For instance, what constitutes the controller, a control, the optimizer, and what exactly is being optimized in particular scenarios? Including algorithm boxes could have been beneficial, especially in the context of your experiments. Additionally, providing examples of existing models that align with your conceptual framework might enhance clarity.
In their work on Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms, Snoek, Larochelle, and Adams suggest optimizing based on expected improvement per second to account for both computational cost and performance trade-offs. It could be interesting to explore how this approach fits within your framework.
The experimental results were presented clearly and effectively demonstrated the utility of the metacontroller. I would be interested in seeing the outcomes of incorporating a larger set of metaexperts.
