The paper is well-written, and the proposed idea is novel.  
However, several crucial details required for reproducing the results (e.g., CNN layer sizes, learning rates) are absent.  
The description of the introspection network's training process could also be more thorough.  
Additionally, employing a model more aligned with the current state-of-the-art for the ImageNet experiments would have strengthened the credibility of the results.  
Given the originality of the idea, I recommend the paper. My rating would improve if a revised version resolves the highlighted concerns.
