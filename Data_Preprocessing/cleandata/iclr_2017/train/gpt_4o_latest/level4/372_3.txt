The paper introduces a novel memory module designed to complement existing neural network architectures.
Strengths:
* The manuscript is well-written and presents an original concept.
* The proposed memory module is effective and demonstrates notable performance improvements.
* The approach is evaluated on several large-scale tasks.
Weaknesses:
* The work lacks comparisons with other memory modules, such as associative LSTMs and similar approaches.
