The paper tackles a significant problem, specifically improving diversity in responses. It is commendable that the authors present results across multiple tasks, demonstrating the method's applicability to various problems.
However, I identify two key weaknesses in the current work:
1) The improvements observed across nearly all tasks appear to be relatively minor and do not fully align with the overarching claims made in the paper.
2) The proposed approach comes across as somewhat ad hoc, leaving it unclear whether this is a method that could or should gain widespread adoption. That said, while the core idea of the proposed solution is intriguing, it feels somewhat underdeveloped at this stage.
