In this paper, the authors propose multiple strategies for selecting a small subset of target vocabulary for each source sentence, leading to notable improvements in processing speed. The results are compelling, and I believe this work provides practical benefits for general seq2seq models applied to language tasks. However, the contribution in terms of novelty is limited, as the authors primarily build upon the work of (Mi et al., 2016) by introducing additional vocabulary selection strategies and conducting more comprehensive experiments. This paper would be more appropriately suited for an NLP-focused venue.
