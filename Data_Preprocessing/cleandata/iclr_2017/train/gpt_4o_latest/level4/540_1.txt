This paper investigates the problem of knowledge transfer from a smaller-capacity network to a larger one. It builds on prior work, specifically Net2Net (ICLR 2015) and NetMorph (ICML 2016).
Comments:
1. This paper addresses a macroscopic problem, where the morphing process is constructed from multiple atomic operations. While these atomic operations were introduced in Net2Net and NetMorph, there has been no prior study on the general modularized process from a principled perspective. Therefore, this paper poses a novel and interesting question.
2. The proposed solution, which involves composing multiple atomic transformations, appears to be reasonable and well-motivated.
3. In the "Related Work" section, it would be better to replace the term "network morphism" with "knowledge transfer," particularly in the subsection title. Most of the related works are commonly referred to as knowledge transfer, and this change would help better align the paper with existing literature.
4. The authors present experiments on variants of ResNet. While the results demonstrate that initializing from ResNet achieves a lower error rate compared to training from scratch, the source of this improvement is not entirely clear.
5. One significant advantage of knowledge transfer methods like Net2Net and NetMorph is their ability to accelerate training and facilitate model exploration. However, the paper does not provide experiments to demonstrate this advantage, possibly due to the loose initialization of BatchNorm. This omission represents a major limitation of the work.
6. Although the proposed method is theoretically capable of performing complex transformations, such as converting an entire ResNet from a single convolutional layer, the experiments are limited to simple module transformations. These simpler transformations could arguably be achieved using atomic operations alone. It would be more compelling to include results for more complex transformations, even if they are less effective, to showcase the broader potential of the method.
Summary:  
This paper tackles a novel problem of knowledge transfer at a macroscopic level. The proposed method is potentially of interest to the ICLR community. However, the experimental evaluation needs improvement (see comment 5) to make the results more convincing and practically relevant. I strongly encourage the authors to address these issues in future revisions.
