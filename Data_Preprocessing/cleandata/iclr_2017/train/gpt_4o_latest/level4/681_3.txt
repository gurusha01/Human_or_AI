Overview:  
This paper presents a promising approach; however, it requires comparisons with additional baselines and a more precise explanation and description, particularly from a signal processing perspective.
Pros:  
- Introduction of a novel descriptor  
- Fast implementation  
Cons:  
a) Insufficient rigor  
b) Excessive length relative to the content  
c) Lack of clarity regarding the computational efficiency of the algorithm  
d) Absence of comparison with the most relevant baseline: the scattering transform  
Below, I elaborate on each of the cons:
a) Section 1:  
The authors justify the use of the scattering transform by highlighting its ability to contract the space while relying on geometric features.  
- The statement, "The nonlinearity used in the scattering network is the complex modulus which is piecewise linear," is unclear. While a real modulus is indeed piecewise linear, a complex modulus, when interpreted in \(\mathbb{C}\) as \(\mathbb{R}^2\), exhibits a bell-shaped curve. Could the authors clarify this point?  
- The symbol \(\Omega\) is introduced without definition or explanation.  
- The claim, "Higher order nonlinearity refers to \(|x|^2\) instead of \(|x|\) as it is usually done in the scattering network," lacks a precise reference. Could the authors provide a specific citation, including the page and paper, to support this assertion?  
Section 2:  
- The motivation for the proposed nonlinearity is unclear. This nonlinearity could significantly increase the variance of the architecture, as it depends on higher moments (up to the fourth moment). A fair evaluation would involve numerically computing the normalized variance (e.g., variance divided by the average \(\ell^2\)-norm) as a sanity check.  
- Additionally, the authors should prove that the energy of the proposed architecture decreases. Without such proof, it is not valid to claim similarity to the scattering transform, which is grounded in precise mathematical foundations. These results are essential, given the differences in the proposed setting.  
- The argument regarding permutation invariance is not convincing, as permutation is not a relevant form of variability in this context.  
- The term "sparsity" is inconsistently defined throughout the paper. At times, it refers to the number of zero values, while at other times, it refers to the \(\ell^1\)-norm. Mathematically, even a value as small as \(10^{-1000}\) is nonzero. The authors should clarify their definition of sparsity.  
- Regarding Figure 4, did the authors compute the graph using the bird dataset? For better clarity, it might be more appropriate to use a ratio instead of absolute values.  
- Finally, the wavelet defined in the paper is not a Morlet wavelet. Could the authors address this discrepancy?  
b) Excessive length:  
The paper is overly long given the amount of content presented. The authors should consider condensing the text to improve readability and focus on the most critical contributions.  
c) Computational efficiency:  
The computational gain of the proposed algorithm is not clearly demonstrated. The authors should provide quantitative evidence to substantiate claims of improved efficiency.  
d) Missing baseline comparison:  
The paper does not compare the proposed method with its most obvious baseline: the scattering transform. Such a comparison is essential to contextualize the contributions and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.
