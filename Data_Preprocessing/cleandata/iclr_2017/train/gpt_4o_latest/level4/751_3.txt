This paper tackles a significant and timely topic with a creative approach. However, I identify three key shortcomings (and one promising idea).
1) The paper provides insufficient context regarding prior work in the field (specifically shallow RL), including studies on "robust RL." For instance, the work of Shie Mannor could serve as a useful starting point to situate this research within the existing literature.
2) The general problem setup is not well-defined. Is it reasonable to retroactively label certain actions as "catastrophic" if the agent is not informed of this criterion during training? Training the system to optimize one metric (reward maximization) but evaluating it on a different metric creates a misleading evaluation framework. It's also possible that the baseline algorithm might outperform the proposed method on the original training metric. To address this, I would like to see plots for "average reward" added to Figure 3. Additionally, what would the baseline learn if it were penalized with large negative rewards for entering these otherwise hidden "danger states"?
3) The proposed solution appears somewhat ad hoc, introducing new domain-specific hyperparameters (kr, klambda, and lambda), a second deep network, and two additional replay memories. Regarding the results, I am uncertain about their reliability, given that cart-pole has historically been fully solved by numerous methods. Is DQN an outlier in this context, or is the convolutional network used here an unsuitable function approximator? Furthermore, which specific "state-of-the-art" variant of DQN is being employed in this study?
The promising idea I encourage the authors to explore further is D_d, the set of rare but dangerous states that should be preserved in some form. This concept could serve as a valuable ingredient for continual learning, addressing a gap in most conventional methods. It also highlights a key distinction between RL and supervised learning, where such states are typically discarded as outliers.
Given my earlier comments and the authors' prompt response ("we implemented expected SARSA"), I had anticipated that the paper would have been updated with the new results by now. Nonetheless, I remain open to discussing these points further and revising my evaluation based on an updated version of the manuscript.
Minor comment: The bibliography is poorly formatted, with missing years, conference venues, and incomplete or misspelled author names (e.g., "Sergey et al. Levine"). Additionally, it is preferable to cite the official conference publications rather than arXiv versions where applicable.
