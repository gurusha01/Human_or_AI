This paper tackles the problem of argument mining, which involves identifying argument types and predicting relationships between arguments. The authors introduce a pointer network architecture to model argument relations and propose modifications to the pointer network to enable joint training for both type prediction and link prediction tasks. While the model appears reasonable, I am uncertain whether ICLR is the most appropriate venue for this work.
My primary concern with the paper lies in the novelty of the proposed model. Pointer networks have been previously introduced, and while the multi-task learning approach presented here is interesting, the authors have only evaluated it on a single task. This raises the question of whether the submission might be better suited for an NLP-focused conference rather than ICLR.
The authors claim that the pointer network is less restrictive compared to certain existing tree-prediction methods. However, the datasets used in the experiments appear to consist solely of single trees or forests. It is worth noting that stack-based methods can handle forest prediction by introducing a virtual root node to each example, as is commonly done in dependency parsing tasks. As a result, the current experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the pointer network approach, which is unfortunate.
My second concern pertains to the choice of the target task. Given the goal of analyzing structures between sentences, is argument mining truly the most suitable dataset? For instance, the authors could validate their model on other tasks that involve tree structures, such as dependency parsing. Regarding NLP applications, the assumption that argument component (AC) boundaries are pre-defined seems overly restrictive and could limit the practical applicability of the proposed model.
Overall, from a machine learning perspective, the baseline methods used for comparison appear to be strong for the argument mining task but may not be sufficiently robust for general tree/forest prediction tasks, as there are other established methods for such tasks. From an NLP perspective, the reliance on predefined AC boundaries is a significant limitation. Consequently, I am inclined to believe that ICLR may not be the most suitable venue for this submission.
