The authors introduce a method that utilizes the statistics of softmax outputs to estimate both the probability of error and the likelihood of a test sample being out-of-domain. They compare the effectiveness of the proposed approach against directly using the softmax output probabilities, without considering their statistics, as a confidence measure.
It would be beneficial if the authors could provide further clarification on the rationale for disregarding the logit of the blank symbol.
It would also be valuable to evaluate the proposed methods in more challenging and confusable scenarios, such as cases where out-of-domain examples closely resemble in-domain examples. For instance, in the context of speech recognition, this could involve testing an ASR system trained on one language with speech from a different language. In such cases, the acoustic properties of speech signals from two distinct languages might exhibit greater similarity compared to the differences between noisy and clean speech signals within the same language.
The explanation of the auxiliary decoder setup in Section 4 could be enhanced by including additional details.
