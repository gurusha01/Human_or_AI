This paper introduces RaSoR, a method designed to efficiently represent and score all possible spans in an extractive QA task. Although the test set results on SQuAD have not yet been disclosed, it appears unlikely that they will achieve state-of-the-art performance. Nonetheless, the proposed approach of enumerating all possible spans has the potential to enhance various architectures. The paper is exceptionally well-written, and the analysis and ablation studies in the final sections are largely compelling (particularly Figure 2, which aligns with intuitive expectations). Given its potential to positively influence other researchers working on SQuAD, I recommend accepting the paper.
