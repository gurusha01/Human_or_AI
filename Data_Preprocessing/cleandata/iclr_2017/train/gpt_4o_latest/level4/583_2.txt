First, the drawbacks:
The paper is challenging to read. While the grammar is technically correct, there are several issues:
- The first four pages are heavily theoretical and hard to follow without concrete examples. Incorporating a consistent example throughout the theoretical discussion would significantly improve clarity.
- The organization of the exposition is problematic. I frequently had to jump ahead to figures or backtrack to earlier sections for key details that seemed to be presented out of sequence. A potential solution could be to structure the paper in the same logical flow as a well-prepared oral presentation of the work.
Additionally, the experimental section is too brief, leaving me uncertain about whether the omitted details are critical. Including these details in a supplementary section would help address these concerns.
Now, the strengths:
The paper excels at synthesizing prior work on novelty generation and introducing a unified framework for evaluating both existing and future models. This is achieved by adapting established generative model evaluation metrics for assessing novelty. While the experiments are relatively simple, they still advance beyond prior work in this domain (to the best of this reviewer's knowledge).
In conclusion, I recommend accepting the paper but strongly suggest revising certain sections to enhance readability. Like many papers on novelty, it will likely attract significant attention from a niche audience but may struggle to engage a broader readership. To address this, the theoretical content should be made more intuitive, and the experiments and results should be presented in a more accessible manner.
