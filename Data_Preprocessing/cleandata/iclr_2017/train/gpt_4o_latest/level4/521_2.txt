Pros:  
- Presentation of an elegant filter bank design along with its implementation.  
- Strong numerical results.  
- Enhancement of the representation through backpropagation, with evidence showing it accelerates learning.  
Cons:  
- The algorithms in Section 3.1 are unnecessary and detract from the paper's clarity. However, providing source code would be a valuable addition.  
- The connection to the scattering transform is not sufficiently clear.  
- In certain instances (as noted in some of my comments), the writing could benefit from further refinement.  
On a personal note, I believe the issues raised in the negative points can be addressed with relative ease.
