This paper introduces a pedestrian detection approach utilizing the Fast RCNN framework enhanced with batch normalization, where EdgeBoxes is employed to generate pedestrian proposals in place of the selective search mechanism used in the original Fast RCNN method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the INRIA and ETH datasets.
Pros:
- The method achieves commendable performance (though it does not surpass state-of-the-art results).
Cons:
- Limited novelty, as Fast RCNN and its derivatives (e.g., Faster RCNN)...
