The revised version of the paper shows improvement compared to the original arXiv submission from June. Although the results remain unchanged, the text now presents them in a more balanced manner without excessive overstatement. It might also be worth considering the removal of terms such as "mantra," among others.  
I maintain that the critique I provided in my comment on 3 Dec 2016 regarding the "randomly generated task" remains valid, and I find your response unconvincing.
