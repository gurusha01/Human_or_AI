This paper provides a well-defined hierarchical taxonomy of transfer learning techniques tailored to sequence tagging tasks. It effectively contextualizes and consolidates prior research on particular cases within this taxonomy. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that previously unexamined areas of the taxonomy can perform on par with or even surpass the state of the art on important benchmark datasets.
While it would be valuable to further investigate aspects such as the trade-offs incurred when transitioning from more restrictive to less restrictive transfer learning strategies, I find this paper compelling and suitable for acceptance in its current form.
