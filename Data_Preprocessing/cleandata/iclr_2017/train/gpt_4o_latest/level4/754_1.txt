This paper introduces enhanced neural language models tailored for capturing selected long-term dependencies, specifically to improve the prediction of the next identifier in dynamic programming languages like Python. The proposed advancements are achieved through:
1) Substituting the fixed-window attention mechanism with a pointer network, where the memory is restricted to the context representations of the preceding K identifiers, effectively summarizing the entire history.  
2) Integrating a conventional LSTM-based neural language model with this sparse pointer network via a controller that dynamically combines the predictions of both components. The combination weights are determined based on the input, hidden state, and context representations at each time step.
This approach eliminates the need for a large attention window to predict the next identifier, which is often required to capture long-term dependencies in programming languages. The effectiveness of the model is partially validated through experiments on a Python codebase, which is another contribution of this work.
However, the paper lacks some critical details that would strengthen its contributions. Specifically, it does not explore how the performance of the sparse pointer network varies with different values of K, nor does it provide a comparison of computational efficiency (in terms of both training and inference) against LSTMs with attention mechanisms of varying window sizes. Additionally, ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of (1) and (2) are missing. Despite these shortcomings, the paper may still be of interest to the ICLR community and merits consideration for acceptance.
