The authors aim to derive analytical equations governing physical systems based on observational data, which is a significant and valuable objective. The ability to distill concise and interpretable rules that describe the behavior of physical systems is indeed crucial. However, the approach employed by the authors relies on simplistic and outdated methods that are unlikely to scale to more complex problems, and the work does not provide any novel insights or advancements to the field.
The core contribution of the paper (as well as the content of the first four pages of the submission) can be distilled into a single sentence:  
"Train a small network with activation functions comprising products of cosine, sinusoid, and input terms, ensuring sparsity in the weights via L1 regularization."  
The resulting sparse network weights, combined with the fixed structure, are then interpreted as the derived equation.
The methodology draws heavily on techniques from the 1990s (for example, the use of the abbreviation ANN on page 3, which has largely fallen out of use) and does not leverage modern advancements in the field, which have progressed significantly since then. I recommend that the authors engage with recent literature and continue refining their approach to address this important problem.
