The paper assesses recent advancements in competitive ILSVRC CNN architectures with a focus on resource utilization. It is evident that significant effort has been invested in the evaluations. The findings are clearly presented, and the topic is undoubtedly relevant.
That said, many of the results are unlikely to surprise practitioners who regularly work with CNNs. Even if some findings do stand out, their practical utility remains unclear. It is difficult to discern what actionable insights can be drawn from these results when addressing new problems with computational constraints or in production environments. In my view, this stems primarily from the paper's lack of discussion on realistic scenarios.
Key concerns:
1) The evaluation does not provide much insight for practical scenarios, which often involve fine-tuning pre-trained networks, as ILSVRC typically serves as a starting point. For example, VGG excels in fine-tuning tasks but is challenging to train from scratch. Additionally, VGG is well-suited for compression, making it potentially a strong choice when these now-standard practices are considered. Addressing such questions would significantly enhance the paper's practical relevance.
2) Compressed networks exhibit a much higher accuracy-to-parameter ratio, making it crucial to evaluate how well models can be compressed or, at the very least, to compare the results against some of the most widely recognized and publicly available compressed networks.
3) The paper lacks an analysis of the network topologies and the identification of bottlenecks. Including such an analysis would add considerable value.
Minor concern:
1) What was the rationale behind the authors' decision to apply batch normalization to NiN and AlexNet?
