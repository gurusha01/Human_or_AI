A differentiable physics engine is undoubtedly a valuable tool to have.
The primary advantage highlighted for the proposed software is its speed; however, no comparisons are provided with other physics engines. While the authors describe the engine's speed using somewhat unconventional units (e.g., "model seconds per day"), the reader is left without a clear sense of whether this performance is fast or slow. For instance, Todorov's engine (my preferred simulator) calculates a dynamics step and its derivatives with respect to both states and controls (via finite differences) in under 1ms for a full humanoid model (his implementation is accessible here: mujoco.org/book/programming.htmlsaDerivative). Based on this, I suspect Todorov's engine might actually outperform the one presented in this paper, though this cannot be confirmed without direct comparison.
Given that the proposed engine is restricted to handling only basic collisions (sphere/sphere and sphere/plane), constructing the example models in several widely-used engines (e.g., ODE, Bullet, and MuJoCo) would be straightforward. A performance comparison across these engines would provide essential context. Without such a comparison, I find the paper to be incomplete.
