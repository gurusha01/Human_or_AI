This paper proposes a polynomial linear model tailored for supervised classification tasks. The approach leverages a combination of the Tensor Train (TT) tensor decomposition technique and a variant of stochastic Riemannian optimization. A set of empirical experiments is conducted, showcasing the competitive performance of the proposed model when compared to suitable baselines.
From a theoretical perspective, I find the approach both intriguing and elegant. The core framework of this work relies on the TT decomposition and the geometric properties of the manifold of tensors with fixed TT-rank, which are well-established in prior literature. The novelty of this paper lies in integrating these components to construct an efficient polynomial linear model. Consequently, I expected the paper to focus primarily on evaluating the efficacy of this integration and demonstrating its advantages over natural alternatives. For instance, as another reviewer pointed out, it would have been valuable to see a comparison with Factorization Machines (FMs) optimized over the manifold of positive definite matrices. Instead, the paper dedicates a disproportionate amount of effort to revisiting prior work.
The empirical evaluation, in my opinion, leaves room for significant improvement. I am particularly intrigued by the notable performance gains achieved through initialization with the standard logistic regression solution. A deeper analysis of this phenomenon would have been helpful, especially to determine whether similar gains could be replicated with other models. Regarding the synthetic dataset, an important missing baseline is a standard feed-forward neural network, which could provide insights into the complexity of the interactions and the modeling difficulty of the dataset. I also concur with the other reviewer on several additional suggestions for enhancing the experimental section.
A few minor typographical errors include: 'Bernoulli distrbution', 'reproduce the experiemnts', and 'generilize better'.
In summary, I remain undecided about this paper. While the central idea is promising, the analysis does not sufficiently emphasize the aspects of the model that make it both novel and compelling.
