This paper introduces a k-shot learning framework that leverages existing pre-trained networks by grouping filters with similar activation patterns. These grouped filters are trained collectively to mitigate overfitting issues when only a limited number of training samples are available.
While the concept presented in the paper is intriguing and the results are promising, the current version requires significant improvements before it can be considered for publication:
Performance:  
The proposed method should be benchmarked against other state-of-the-art k-shot learning approaches, such as Matching Networks (Vinyals et al., 2016). The paper does not provide a clear comparison to demonstrate how this method performs relative to these established techniques.
Missing Explanation:  
The experimental setup for k-shot learning is insufficiently detailed and requires further elaboration.
Measure:  
Using accuracy differences to compare the baseline and the proposed method is not ideal. Reporting raw accuracy values would provide a more straightforward and meaningful comparison.
Presentation Issues:  
The paper contains numerous grammatical errors and improperly formatted citations, such as:  
- "M. et al. (2011)"  
- "ImageNet (Alex et al. (2012))"  
- "Judy et al. (2013)" (this reference is repeated three times in the bibliography).  
These issues need to be addressed to improve the overall clarity and professionalism of the manuscript.
