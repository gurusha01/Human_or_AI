This paper introduces three enhancements to scattering networks: (1) a non-linearity enabling Fourier-domain computation, (2) compactly supported representations in the Fourier domain, and (3) the inclusion of additional variance features.
The technical contributions appear promising, as 1 and 2 could lead to improved computational efficiency, while 3 has the potential to enhance accuracy. However, the presentation and evaluation of these contributions are inadequate. With clearer writing and more comprehensive evaluation, I would have been inclined to recommend acceptance, as the underlying ideas are valuable.
A major issue with the paper is the excessive length and complexity of many sentences, which often obscure the content. For instance, the last paragraph of Section 1 exemplifies this issue, though the problem is pervasive throughout the manuscript.
Similarly, many equations are unnecessarily complex. For example, Eq. 5 could be simplified to just two lines:
X_0 = x  
Xl = |X{l-1} * Psi_l|  
where the |.| operator denotes element-wise computation. Most of the hyperparameter dependencies, indices, and repetitive iterations are superfluous. This critique applies broadly to Equations 5 through 13.
The argument based on cardinality in Eq. 14 does not convincingly demonstrate that variance is more informative. One could just as easily argue that the cardinality of S concatenated with any arbitrary quantity is greater than or equal to the cardinality of S. A stronger argument grounded in machine learning theory would be more appropriate.
The authors should aim to make their claims less exaggerated and provide stronger evidence to support them. For example, assertions about discovering invariants for any input (Abstract) and fundamental structures (last paragraph of Section 1.2.1) lack mathematical justification. How can we ensure that semantically relevant representations are being isolated? While machine learning methods offer at least some theoretical guarantees, the feature construction in this work appears more heuristic. Although this does not detract from the core idea, this aspect requires deeper investigation and substantiation.
