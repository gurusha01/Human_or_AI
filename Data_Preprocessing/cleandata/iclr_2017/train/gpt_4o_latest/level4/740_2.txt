UPDATED REVIEW (Paraphrased):
I reviewed the arXiv version of the paper, which is significantly longer and appears to present the material in a more rigorous manner. Notably, Figure 3 in the arXiv version provides greater insight. However, since my task is to evaluate the submitted version, my overall assessment remains unchanged. This work does not represent a minor incremental contribution, but compressing it into a conference submission of this length requires a more focused approach. I recommend that the authors identify the core message they wish to convey and concentrate on that. As stated in the submission, "...ICLR submission focus on the ParMAC algorithm...," I suggest prioritizing this focus—moving all extensions and theoretical remarks to the appendix or removing them altogether—and instead dedicating an additional page to a detailed explanation of the algorithm. Furthermore, it is essential to clearly articulate the relationship between the arXiv paper and the submission, explicitly noting that the latter is a condensed version of the former.
ORIGINAL REVIEW (Paraphrased):
The submission introduces ParMAC, a distributed variant of the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates (MAC).
Related Work: In the section discussing convex ERM and related methods, I recommend citing general communication-efficient frameworks such as COCOA (Ma et al.) and AIDE (Reddi et al.), as these works are more closely aligned with the practical objectives of this paper. In contrast, several of the cited papers appear less relevant.
Section 2: The explanation of MAC in this section is relatively clear. However, the discussion on MAC and EM does not seem particularly useful.
Section 3: This section is much less clear. The notation is difficult to follow, especially in the discussion of speedups, where symbols are introduced in different parts of the text without sufficient context. A brief summary or notation overview in the introduction might help. In the second paragraph, the text assumes the reader understands how data and other elements are distributed, but this is only clarified later. The term "submodel" is also unclear; a more precise example referencing equations (1) and (2) would be helpful. Based on my understanding, there are P independent sets of submodels that traverse the machines in a circular manner. However, it is unclear how these submodels are initialized (are they identical?), and more importantly, what constitutes a single output of the algorithm (e.g., averaging, which does not seem to fit). Since these points are not addressed, I am left guessing, which I see as a major issue.
I find the later sections on extensions, speedup models, convergence, and topologies unsatisfactory. It is unclear whether these contributions are novel, as the authors refer to other works for details. If they are novel, the explanations are insufficient—particularly in the speedup section, which includes undefined quantities like T(P) (or at least I could not locate their definitions). If they are not novel, the explanations do not provide additional clarity beyond what could be achieved with a much shorter summary and references to prior work. For example, the claim that the original convergence guarantees can be recovered seems significant, but the authors only point to other work without elaboration. Similarly, in the discussion on topologies, the claim that the method performs "true SGD" is vague and unexplained, and other statements in this section also lack justification or clarity.
Experimental Section: The experiments suggest that the method is promising for binary autoencoders, but it is unclear how these results generalize to other models. Additionally, ParMAC is only compared to itself, with a focus on scaling properties, rather than being benchmarked against alternative methods.
Conclusion: The conclusions include statements that are either too strong or misleading based on the presented evidence. For instance, the claim that "we analysed its parallel speedup and convergence" seems unsubstantiated. Similarly, the assertion that "The convergence properties of MAC remain essentially unaltered in ParMAC" is unsupported, regardless of the intended meaning of "essentially unchanged."
Summary: While the method appears relevant for a specific model class (binary autoencoders), the clarity of the presentation is insufficient. I would not be able to reproduce the algorithm used in the experiments based on the current description. Additionally, the paper includes several claims that are questionable or inadequately supported.
