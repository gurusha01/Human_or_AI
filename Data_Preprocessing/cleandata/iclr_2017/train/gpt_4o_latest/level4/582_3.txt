The paper introduces a method for integrating arbitrary content types, such as images and text, into recommender systems. While various features have been used previously to enhance recommender systems, the novelty here lies in presenting a general-purpose framework capable of combining arbitrary feature types.
On the positive side, the ambition to integrate diverse and heterogeneous feature types into recommender systems is commendable and relatively novel. Although prior research has explored incorporating multiple feature types to improve recommender systems, successfully combining such diverse features remains a challenging task.
On the negative side, there are certain aspects of the paper that feel somewhat ad-hoc. Specifically:
-- The system involves several components being "glued together" to form the final model. Different components are trained separately and subsequently combined through an additional learning stage. While this approach is entirely valid (and arguably the most straightforward and practical), it shifts the contribution more toward "system building" rather than "end-to-end learning," which is a stronger focus of this conference.
-- Building on the above point, this raises questions about the system's ability to generalize to truly arbitrary feature types, such as audio or video. Incorporating such features would likely require significant implementation effort, rather than being a plug-and-play system where additional features could be seamlessly integrated.
The pre-review comments address some of these concerns, though certain responses are less convincing. For instance, it would have been preferable to maintain consistent baselines across tables, rather than omitting some with the justification that "the case had already been made elsewhere."
That said, I appreciate the effort to incorporate multiple feature types using real-world recommender system datasets. However, I am uncertain about the strength of the baselines, as they seem more akin to ablation studies than direct comparisons with state-of-the-art recommender systems.
