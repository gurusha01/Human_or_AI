This paper is somewhat challenging to follow. The explanation of the proposed algorithm could be significantly improved by incorporating pseudo-code to illustrate the computational flow or a diagram to clearly depict the update process. In its current form, I am uncertain if I fully grasp all aspects of the methodology. Additionally, I would have appreciated a precise explanation of the labels in Fig. 1 (e.g., "SGD task-wise, 1 comm"â€”did you intend to refer to layer-wise updates?).
There are two major concerns regarding the evaluation: first, the absence of comparisons with baseline asynchronous methods, such as those employing a parameter server. Second, using AlexNet as a benchmark is not particularly insightful. AlexNet differs substantially from modern state-of-the-art image recognition models, particularly in its significantly fewer layers, which is especially pertinent to the discussion in Section 6.3. Furthermore, AlexNet's reliance on numerous fully-connected layers skews the compute-to-communication ratios in ways that are not representative of most contemporary architectures.
