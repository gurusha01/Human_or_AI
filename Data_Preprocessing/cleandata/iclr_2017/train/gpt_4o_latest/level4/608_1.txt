Review - Summary:  
This paper investigates the pros and cons of employing the sine activation function in neural networks.  
The authors begin by illustrating that even for simple tasks, the use of sine activations can lead to loss functions that are challenging to optimize.  
Next, they evaluate networks with various activation functions on the MNIST dataset and find that the periodic nature of the sine activation is not essential for effectively learning the task.  
Finally, they examine several algorithmic tasks where the periodicity of the sine function proves to be advantageous.  
Pros:  
The analytical derivations of the loss surface were engaging and provided valuable insights, while the balanced discussion of both the strengths and weaknesses of the sine activation function was highly informative.  
Cons:  
The work appears to be more of an initial exploration into the potential utility of sine activations, requiring additional evidence to draw significant conclusions. For instance, the MNIST results suggest that a truncated sine function performs just as well, and while the observation that tanh may leverage its saturated regions more is intriguing, the two functions seem largely interchangeable. Additionally, the findings from the toy algorithmic tasks are difficult to generalize or interpret definitively.
