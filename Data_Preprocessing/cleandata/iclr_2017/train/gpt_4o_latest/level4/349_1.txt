This paper presents an integration of a memory network with reinforcement learning. While the experimental data is straightforward, the proposed model is both intriguing and relatively novel. However, there are several questions regarding the model:
1. How does the model generalize to scenarios involving multiple variables within a single sentence?
2. In cases where the answer lies outside the vocabulary, how does the model address this issue?
3. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more detailed analysis of the curriculum learning component, as it plays a critical role in training the RL model.
4. During training, for each iteration, how were the data samples selectedâ€”randomly or progressively, starting from simpler one-depth examples to more complex multi-depth ones?
