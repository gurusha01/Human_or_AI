The idea of training natural language systems by engaging multiple agents in an interactive referential communication game is quite appealing. As noted by the authors, while there has been some (albeit seemingly limited) prior research on employing multi-agent games to foster communication, this approach certainly appears to be a promising avenue for exploration. Furthermore, the strategy of alternating between these games and supervised learning, as demonstrated in the experiment outlined in Section 5 and proposed in Section 6, seems particularly productive.
Regarding "clarity," it appears that certain network connections in Fig. 1 have been omitted, presumably for simplification. However, given the highly customized architecture and the somewhat challenging-to-follow explanation in Section 3, the simplified diagram only adds to the confusion. The figure likely requires refinement, but at a minimum (and especially if I am misinterpreting it), a caption should be included to assist readers in understanding the diagram.
In general, the framework presented in Section 2 is excellent and appears to be effective and versatile in several respects. The results are reasonable, and I anticipate that this work will inspire some intriguing future extensions.
Caveat: While I am fairly confident in my understanding of the paper (as reflected in the confidence score below), I do not feel sufficiently well-versed in the most closely related literature to accurately evaluate the positioning of this work within that broader context.
