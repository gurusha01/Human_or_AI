In this paper, the authors propose the use of a distinct introspection neural network to directly predict the future values of weights based on their historical progression. The introspection network is trained using parameter trajectories obtained from training a separate set of meta-learning models with a standard optimizer, such as SGD.
Pros:  
+ The paper is generally well-organized and easy to follow.  
+ The proposed meta-learning approach is novel and represents a departure from traditional "learning to learn" methodologies.  
Cons:  
- The experimental evaluation would be more robust if it included additional neural network architectures, such as fully connected and recurrent neural networks, where the parameter space geometry differs significantly from that of CNNs.  
- The architectural details for the experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets are not adequately explained.  
- The paper does not specify the mini-batch size used in the experiments.  
- A comparison with alternative baseline optimizers, such as Adam, would strengthen the work. Alternatively, the authors should clarify how hyperparameters, such as learning rate and momentum, were selected for the baseline SGD optimizer.  
Overall:  
The lack of detailed experimental information in the current version of the paper makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the proposed method.
