This paper introduces a dynamic coattention network designed for the question answering task involving lengthy contextual documents. The proposed model effectively captures co-dependent representations of both the question and the document, while a dynamic decoder iteratively identifies potential answer spans to determine the final answer.
Overall, the paper is well-written. While the model is somewhat complex (comprising a coattention encoder, an iterative dynamic pointer decoder, and a highway maxout network), the underlying intuitions and model details are explained clearly. Additionally, the model demonstrates strong performance on the SQuAD dataset. I recommend this paper for acceptance.
