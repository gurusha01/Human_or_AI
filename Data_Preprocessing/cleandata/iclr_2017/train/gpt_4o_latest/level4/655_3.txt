This paper proposes the use of the BPA criterion for classifier ensembles.
My primary concern with the paper is that it attempts to combine several distinct concepts, which makes some straightforward ideas harder to grasp. For instance:
(1) The term "Distributed" in this paper essentially refers to classifier ensembles and is unrelated to distributed training or distributed computation mechanisms. While it is true that individual classifiers could be trained in a distributed manner, this is not the focus of the paper.
(2) The paper employs "Transfer learning" in a narrow sense, specifically referring to fine-tuning the final layer of a pre-trained classifier.
Beyond the conceptual blending in the paper, I have the following additional comments:
(1) I am uncertain how the BPA criterion addresses class imbalance more effectively than simple re-weighting. Essentially, the BPA criterion assigns equal weights to all classes, irrespective of the number of training samples per class. This issue can be easily addressed in conventional training by incorporating a class-specific weight term for each data point, where the weight is the inverse of the number of samples in the corresponding class.
(2) Algorithm 2 is not presented accurately, as it appears to suggest that test data is used during training, which is incorrect. Only the training and validation datasets should be utilized. Additionally, the paper's usage of "train/validation" and "test" is confusing. Why are "train/validation" always grouped together? How are they properly distinguished?
(3) If my understanding is correct, the paper proposes computing the BPA criterion in a batch-wise manner, meaning BPA can only be calculated after processing the entire train/validation dataset. This approach conflicts with the stochastic gradient descent typically employed in deep network training. How does BPA handle this discrepancy? Furthermore, the paper lacks an experimental analysis of computation cost and timing, which I believe is necessary.
Overall, I find the paper lacks clarity in its presentation, and several key definitions remain ambiguous.
