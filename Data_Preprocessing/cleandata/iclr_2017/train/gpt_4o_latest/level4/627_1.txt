This paper introduces a multimodal neural machine translation approach, building on prior work with variational methods while attempting to incorporate image-based grounding of semantics. Exploring ways to enhance translation using visual information appears to be a reasonable approach when such data is accessible.
However, as noted by a previous reviewer, the method employed for model selection in the paper is not entirely appropriate. This significantly diminishes the significance of the performance improvements reported by the authors. Furthermore, as acknowledged by the authors in their response to questions, it remains unclear whether the model effectively learns to capture meaningful image semantics. Consequently, it is regrettably difficult to determine whether this paper makes a substantive contribution to the research direction that initially motivated it.
