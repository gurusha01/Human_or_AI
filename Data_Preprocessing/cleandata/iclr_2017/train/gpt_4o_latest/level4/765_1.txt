This paper proposes the addition of a reward-predicting head to an existing neural network architecture for video frame prediction. The authors demonstrate that their model can effectively predict both rewards and subsequent frames in Atari game-playing scenarios.
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and straightforward to follow.
- The proposed model is clearly explained.
Weaknesses:
- The model presents only incremental improvements over the baseline. While the authors clarify that their goal is to establish a pre-condition, which they successfully achieve, this results in the paper having a rather narrow scope.
Overall, this work feels like the foundation for a strong, comprehensive paper or a solid short paper. Expanding on the future directions outlined by the authors could lead to a significant contribution. However, in its current form, the paper offers limited novelty.
