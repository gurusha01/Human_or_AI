The authors present a transfer learning methodology applied across various NLP tasks, where the tasks seem to follow a progression in complexity, ranging from simpler syntactic tasks to more challenging semantic ones.
Novelty: The authors' approach to transfer learning involves integrating models for each task in a manner that aligns with the established hierarchy of task complexity in NLP. In this sense, the proposed framework resembles a cascaded architecture more than a conventional transfer learning setup. There is some prior work in this domain (e.g., the first two results from a Google search:
