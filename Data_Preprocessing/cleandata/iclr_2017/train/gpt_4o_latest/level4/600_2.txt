This paper introduces a group sparse auto-encoder for feature extraction. The authors subsequently integrate the group sparse auto-encoders with CNNs to enhance question sentence representations for QA tasks.
Pros:  
- The concept of a group-sparse auto-encoder appears novel.  
- Comprehensive experiments conducted on QA tasks.  
Cons:  
- The proposed idea feels somewhat incremental.  
- The writing requires improvement.  
- The paper lacks ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
Additionally, I remain unconvinced by the authors' response regarding the baseline. Conducting separate training stages for CNN+SGL as a comparison is acceptable. The goal is to validate and analyze why the proposed SGA is preferable over alternatives like group lassoâ€”for instance, whether joint training leads to improvements or the proposed group-sparse regularization outperforms the \( l_{21} \) norm. However, the current experiments fail to provide such insights.
