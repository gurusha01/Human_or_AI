The problem addressed in this work is well-motivated, the proposed approach is both insightful and intuitive, and the results effectively demonstrate the validity of the method (though the range of applications could be broader). I appreciate that the authors leverage POS and NER as intermediate signals to inform the decision-making process. Additionally, they benchmark their model against a sufficiently diverse set of baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The authors' responses to my questions were convincing, and I believe the results provide adequate evidence to support the efficacy of the inductive bias incorporated through the fine-grained gating model.
