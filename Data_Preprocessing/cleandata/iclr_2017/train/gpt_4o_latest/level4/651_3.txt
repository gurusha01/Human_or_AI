Methods such as adaptive dropout similarly utilize a binary mask that depends on the input to a neuron, closely resembling the proposed technique. The revised draft still does not clearly articulate how the proposed method functionally diverges from adaptive dropout. Additionally, the experimental evaluation remains limited, as it lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches.
