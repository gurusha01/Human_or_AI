The paper introduces a method for sequence generation by applying a known approach to features extracted using another pre-existing method. The work is heavily focused on the selected technologies but lacks sufficient coverage of the broader literature on sequence generation. In particular, the rich body of research on motion prediction across various applications could provide valuable context. Recent models for sequence prediction from primed inputs, such as those used for skeleton data, demonstrate the ability to learn complex motion patterns without requiring pre-processing.
A significant concern lies in the evaluation of the proposed method. There is no quantitative evaluation provided, nor is there any comparison with alternative approaches.
It remains unclear whether the intermediate representation (developed by Plamondon et al.) is genuinely beneficial in the context of a fully trained sequence generation model. It is worth investigating whether the model could independently learn the necessary transformations. This aspect warrants further evaluation.
Details:
The paper contains several typos and instances of word omissions, which should be addressed through a careful rereading of the manuscript.
At the beginning of Section 3, the application of the proposed method remains ambiguous. Is it intended for predicting dynamic parameters? If so, for what purpose? Section 3 should provide a clearer and more compelling motivation for the work.
Regarding the following paragraph:
"While such methods are superior for handwriting analysis and biometric purposes, we opt for a less precise method (Berio & Leymarie, 2015) that is less sensitive to sampling quality and is aimed at generating virtual target sequences that remain perceptually similar to the original trace."
The method referenced here has not been adequately explained. A scientific paper should be self-contained and provide sufficient details for readers to understand the approach.
The authors state that the "V2V-model is conditioned on (...)," but the explanation lacks sufficient detail.
In general, the paper would benefit from greater effort to ensure it is self-contained and comprehensively explains the methods and concepts used.
The IAM dataset is an offline dataset consisting of images. How were the stroke sequences generated from this dataset? Additionally, recent models for sequence prediction from primed inputs, such as those used for skeleton data, are capable of learning complex motion patterns without pre-processing. Did the authors review the state-of-the-art in this area? Shouldn't these models be applicable to the problem at hand?
