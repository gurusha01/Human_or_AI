This paper introduces minor yet significant adjustments that can be applied to differentiable programs to enhance their learnability. These adjustments, as demonstrated, notably improve the convergence of optimization processes associated with learning programs via gradient descent. However, the range of programs that can be effectively learned remains limited and is unlikely to have immediate practical utility.
