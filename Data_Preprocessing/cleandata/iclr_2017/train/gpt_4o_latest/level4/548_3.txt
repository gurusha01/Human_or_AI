The research focus of this paper is highly compelling.  
Nonetheless, the empirical results fall short of compensating for the shortcomings of the proposed method (refer to Section 6).  
"Throughout this paper, the selection of hyper-parameters was kept rather simple," yet the momentum term for CPN is set to 0.95 instead of 0.9, as used in most or all of the optimizers to which CPN is compared. I suspect that any observed positive effect of CPN is primarily attributable to its momentum term.
