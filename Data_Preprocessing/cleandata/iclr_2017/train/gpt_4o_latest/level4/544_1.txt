I would be very enthusiastic about having access to this tool and incorporating it into my research. It is an excellent contribution.
That said, the paper is lacking in detail. Specifically, I believe it would be extremely challenging for others to reimplement the research due to the insufficient level of detail provided. Replicability is a cornerstone of scientific progress, and other works proposing software (e.g., the TensorFlow, Theano, and Edward papers) are typically accompanied by open-source code. Unfortunately, this paper does not include such resources, leaving the overall contribution incomplete.
I am also not entirely convinced that ICLR is the most suitable venue for this work. Robotics-focused conferences such as IROS or ICRA might find it more aligned with their interests. Nonetheless, I encourage the authors to engage with those communities to maximize the impact of their work.
