This paper addresses the challenge of decoding diverse solutions from neural sequence models. The authors introduce an additional term to the log-likelihood of standard neural sequence models, which promotes diversity in the generated solutions. To tackle the inference problem, the paper employs a modified beam search algorithm.
On the positive side, there is limited prior work on generating diverse outputs in RNN/LSTM models, making this paper one of the few contributions in this area. Furthermore, the paper is well-written and easy to understand.
However, the novelty of the work appears to be modest. There is substantial prior research on encouraging diversity in probabilistic graphical models, where additional terms are often incorporated into the objective function to achieve this goal. From that perspective, the approach proposed here does not differ significantly from earlier work. While it is true that most prior studies focus on probabilistic graphical models, and this paper applies the concept to RNN/LSTM models, the fact that RNN/LSTM models can be interpreted as probabilistic models makes the novelty relatively minor.
The proposed diverse beam search method is fairly straightforward. It partitions the beam search space into groups but does not account for diversity within each group, likely to reduce computational complexity. This approach seems like a simple heuristic. In contrast, prior work on diverse solutions in probabilistic graphical models often involves developing more sophisticated algorithmic techniques, particularly to ensure efficiency. By comparison, the solution presented in this paper appears less innovative for a conference paper.
The experimental results demonstrate improvements over previous methods (Li & Jurafsky, 2015, 2016). However, the rigor of these comparisons is somewhat uncertain, as they rely on the authors' own implementation of the baseline methods (Li & Jurafsky, 2015, 2016).

Update: With the authors making their code publicly available (and assuming it remains accessible), some of my concerns regarding the rigor of the experiments have been mitigated. Consequently, I am raising my rating to 6.
