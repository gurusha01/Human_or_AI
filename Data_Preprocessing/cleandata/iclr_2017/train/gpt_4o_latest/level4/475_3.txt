This paper presents an intriguing approach to addressing reparameterization in VAEs when dealing with discrete variables. The core idea involves introducing a smoothing transformation that is shared between the generative and recognition models, resulting in beneficial cancellations. 
Another notable contribution is the use of an RBM as the prior model \( P(z) \), coupled with autoregressive connections in both the generative and recognition models. However, the overall framework becomes somewhat intricate and entangled, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact source of the reported strong performance. It would have been helpful to see experiments that isolate and evaluate these contributions individually.
While the framework's complexity might pose challenges, this could be mitigated if user-friendly software is provided, enabling a plug-and-play experience. 
In summary, the paper is dense with innovative ideas and would make a valuable addition to the conference.
