This paper employs HDP-HMM to address challenging bioacoustics segmentation tasks, such as segmenting humpback whale sounds and bird vocalizations. While the technique itself is not novel, its application as a data-driven approach to bioacoustics segmentation presents significant challenges and has the potential to yield meaningful scientific insights, making it a valuable contribution to the bioacoustics domain. However, my primary concern with this work is the lack of a fair comparison with simpler methods, such as BIC and AIC. Including such comparisons would strengthen the paper. In particular, as the authors have noted, the computational cost of HDP-HMM is a major drawback, and simpler methods might address this issue more efficiently.
