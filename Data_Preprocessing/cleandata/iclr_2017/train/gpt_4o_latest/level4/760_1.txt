The paper introduces a method for learning interpretable hierarchical template representations from provided data. The authors demonstrate their approach using binary images.
The work proposes a novel framework for deriving interpretable hierarchical template representations through a set of standard operations. It further establishes how these operations collectively correspond to a boolean matrix factorization task. Leveraging this insight, the authors develop a message-passing technique, which is shown to yield accurate results for problems of this nature.
Summary:  
———  
The paper introduces a novel approach for extracting hierarchical template representations, which has not been explored in this specific form before. However, the experimental results are limited to small-scale data, and extending the proposed method to more complex, natural images appears non-trivial to me.
Quality: Some of the techniques could benefit from more detailed explanations to enhance the reader's intuition.  
Clarity: Certain derivations and underlying intuitions require further elaboration for better comprehension.  
Originality: The proposed idea is interesting but currently constrained to binary data.  
Significance: Given the limited experimental scope, it is challenging to assess the broader significance of the work.

1. My primary concern pertains to the experimental evaluation. While the proposed approach is promising, its applicability seems restricted to binary images at this stage. Could the authors provide further comments on this limitation?  
2. The authors may wish to reference existing techniques for extracting image representations, such as approaches based on grammars.
