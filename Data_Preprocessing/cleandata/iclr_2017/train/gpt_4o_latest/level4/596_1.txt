In this paper, the authors introduce an implicit ResoNet model designed for knowledge base completion. The model conducts inference implicitly through the use of a search controller and shared memory. The proposed method achieves promising results on the FB15k benchmark dataset.
Pros:
- The proposed method exhibits strong performance on the FB15k dataset.
- The concept of employing shared memory for knowledge base completion is novel and intriguing.
- The approach is generalizable and has the potential to be applied to a variety of tasks.
Cons:
- The paper lacks qualitative analysis of the results, making it difficult to understand why the proposed method is effective for the knowledge base completion task.
- The introduction section could be improved. In particular, the authors should provide stronger motivation for the use of "shared memory" in the introduction and clarify how it differs from existing methods that rely on "unshared memory" for knowledge base completion. Additionally, the role of the search controller is not well-explained in the introduction, as the concept of "search" in the context of knowledge base completion remains unclear. The ideas of shared memory and the search controller only became clear to me after reading Section 2.
