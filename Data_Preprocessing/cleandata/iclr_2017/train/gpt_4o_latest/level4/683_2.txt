The authors state that achieving SOTA results is not their primary objective. However, the observation that an ensemble of ResNets underperforms compared to certain single-network results suggests that additional experimentation, ideally on larger datasets, is warranted. Furthermore, the literature review would benefit from referencing existing works, such as Wide ResNets.
