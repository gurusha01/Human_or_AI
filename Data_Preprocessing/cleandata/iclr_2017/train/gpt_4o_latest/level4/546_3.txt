Thank you for providing an engaging and thought-provoking paper.
To the best of my knowledge, there are very few studies that have explored transfer learning in the absence of target domain data (referred to by the authors as "extrapolation"). This paper effectively demonstrates that understanding the underlying system dynamics is essential in such scenarios. The experimental results convincingly highlight the promising potential of the proposed EQL model. Additionally, I find EQL particularly intriguing from the standpoint of interpretability, which is a critical aspect of data analysis in scientific domains.
Questions and comments:
1. Multiplication units: According to the universal approximation theorem, multiplication can also be approximated by a standard neural network. While I agree with the authors' distinction between interpolation and extrapolation, I am still unclear about why the multiplication unit is indispensable in this context. Could it be because this representation tends to generalize better when the training data does not adequately represent future scenarios?
2. Fitting an EQL vs. fitting a polynomial: It appears that the number of layers in the EQL model may correspond, in some sense, to the degree of a polynomial. If we assume that the underlying dynamics to be learned can be expressed as a polynomial, how does fitting a polynomial (using model selection techniques to determine the degree) differ from fitting an EQL (using model selection techniques to determine the number of layers)? Furthermore, your experiments suggest that the choice of basis functions, tailored to the specific underlying dynamics, is critical for performance. Doesn't this imply that some prior knowledge of the equation's form is necessary?
3. Error bounds: Ben-David et al. (2010) provided error bounds for hypotheses trained on source data and tested on target data. Could your EQL model achieve tighter error bounds in such settings?
4. Comparison to uncertainty-based methods: How does your method compare to approaches that model extrapolation data while incorporating uncertainty? Could you elaborate on this aspect?
