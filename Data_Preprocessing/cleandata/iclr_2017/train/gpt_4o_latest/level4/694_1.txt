The authors propose a well-designed and carefully implemented system for lipreading. The key innovation lies in the end-to-end nature of the system, with the inclusion of sentence-level prediction setting it apart from prior work. The neural network architecture integrates convolutional and recurrent layers, employs a CTC sequence loss for training, and utilizes beam search decoding with a language model to achieve optimal results. The system's performance is assessed on the GRID dataset, accompanied by saliency map visualizations and confusion matrix analysis.
In general, the work is of high quality, clearly articulated, and supported by thorough explanations. The final results and accompanying analysis are commendable. However, one concern is that the novelty primarily stems from the application domain rather than the methods themselves. Additionally, the absence of word-level comparisons makes it challenging to disentangle the contributions of sentence-level information from those of the model architecture and decoding choices. Lastly, the GRID dataset's constrained grammar and reliance on an n-gram dictionary limit the scope of the findings. While the system is evidently well-engineered and delivers impressive results, its broader implications remain somewhat unclear.
