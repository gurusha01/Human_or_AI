The paper presents a set of recommendations for designing differentiable programming languages, drawing insights from factors that have contributed to the success of gradient descent in experimental settings.
I should note that I am not an expert in program induction. While I recognize the value in the paper's goal of facilitating program learning, I did not find the work particularly engaging. One concern is that the entire framework is built on Terpret, which is not yet publicly available. Additionally, the discussion leans heavily toward programming language design, with comparatively less emphasis on the learning aspects. This makes me think the paper might resonate better with an audience at a programming language conference. Furthermore, a comparison with alternative approaches that do not involve code generation would strengthen the motivation for the proposed setup, in my opinion.
Pros:  
The study is useful, well-executed, and novel.  
Cons:  
Limited focus on learning-specific contributions, with more emphasis on domain-specific constraints. May not be an ideal fit for ICLR.
