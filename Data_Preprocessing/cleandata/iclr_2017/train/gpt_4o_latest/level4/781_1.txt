The paper explores the challenge of learning compact binary data representations. However, I find the setting difficult to comprehend, and the writing does little to clarify it. For instance, the problem is not explained in a straightforward manner, and I am unfamiliar with this area of research. Despite reading the authors' responses to reviewers' questions and revisiting the paper, I still struggle to fully grasp the setting, which prevents me from properly assessing the contributions of this work. Additionally, the related work section is missing, with the discussion of prior literature dispersed throughout the paper in a somewhat disorganized manner. The paper lacks derivations, and many statements are presented without proper references, such as those in the fourth paragraph of Section 3. Based on these issues, I believe the paper requires substantial revisions before it can be considered for publication.
