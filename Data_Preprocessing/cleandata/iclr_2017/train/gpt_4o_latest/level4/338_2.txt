The paper presents an alternative perspective on hierarchical feature representations in deep neural networks. The proposed viewpoint of refining representations is well-justified and aligns with the demonstrated success of modern architectures such as ResNets.
Strengths:
- Provides strong motivation for the efficacy of ResNets and Highway networks.
- Offers thorough and convincing analysis and evaluation.
Weaknesses:
- The implications of this finding on the interpretation of batch-normalization are only briefly discussed, despite appearing to be significant.
- The explanation of findings from Zeiler & Fergus (2014) through the lens of the UIE viewpoint is absent.
Comments:
- There is a missing word in line 223: "that it is valid."
