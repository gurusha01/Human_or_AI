This paper introduces a variant of the semi-supervised VAE model that unifies the objectives for supervised and unsupervised VAEs. This modification enhances the flexibility of software implementations by allowing easier specification of which variables are supervised and which are unsupervised.
The proposed approach adds a few additional terms compared to the original semi-supervised VAE formulation by Kingma et al., 2014. However, based on the experimental results, these additional terms appear to have minimal impact, as the performance differences between the proposed method and the original formulation are not substantial (Figure 5). Consequently, the primary advantage of the new formulation seems to lie in the added flexibility and convenience for software engineering purposes.
While this flexibility and convenience are valuable, it would strengthen the paper to include examples of scenarios where the proposed method can be applied effectively, particularly in cases where previous methods would face significant challenges.
The title and presentation of the paper create expectations for more substantial contributions than what is currently provided. For instance, I anticipated seeing structured hidden variable models for the posterior (as suggested on page 4, top) or a genuinely "structured interpretation" of the generative model (as implied by the title). Unfortunately, these aspects are not addressed, and the main contribution—a variant of the semi-supervised VAE model—feels somewhat disconnected from these expectations.
Additionally, the plug-in estimation method for discrete variables is only valid when the function h(x, y) is continuous with respect to y. If h(x, y) is discontinuous in y (e.g., if h takes one form when y=1 and another when y=2), the approach of substituting Expectation[y] for y becomes invalid. Thus, the "plug-in" estimation approach has notable limitations that should be acknowledged.
