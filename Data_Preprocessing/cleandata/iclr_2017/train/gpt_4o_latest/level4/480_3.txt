This paper introduces a recurrent architecture designed to simultaneously predict the motion and action states of agents.  
The manuscript is well-written, clearly presented, and supported by robust experimental results.  
The authors demonstrate that incorporating motion prediction into the network leads to improved classification of action states, enabling more accurate predictions with reduced training data.  
Additionally, they illustrate that the network's learned representations are interpretable and organized hierarchically.  
Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a critical discussion on the interaction between motion and behavior that is necessary to fully realize the advantages of the proposed model.  
- Furthermore, there is no exploration of how this approach could be extended to more complex scenarios, such as those involving "animals," visual input, or more generalized "behaviors."  
This critique stems from the fact that the title and abstract suggest a broad applicability to general behavior modeling, whereas the experiments are limited to two specific and relatively simple cases.  
Without further evidence, the original claim appears somewhat overstated. Using terms like "insects" or "fruit flies" would be more precise than "animals."
