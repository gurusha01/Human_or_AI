Strengths  
-- Presents an intriguing approach to designing a compact CNN architecture tailored for embedded applications.  
-- Offers a well-balanced investigation of both the macroarchitecture and microarchitecture of CNNs, incorporating fire modules effectively.  
-- Demonstrates x50 reduction in memory usage compared to AlexNet while maintaining comparable accuracy.  
-- Provides robust experimental results.  
Weaknesses  
-- It would be beneficial to evaluate SqueezeNet across a broader range of tasks.  
-- Lacks in-depth insights and comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to SqueezeNet's performance. For instance, how do ResNet and GoogleNet influence or relate to the proposed architecture? Additionally, an earlier study (Analysis of correlation structure for a neural predictive model with application to speech recognition, Neural Networks, 1994) highlighted that a "bypass" architecture, combining linear and nonlinear prediction terms, enhances long-term dependency in neural networks through rigorous perturbation analysis. Could this work be framed more rigorously within a theoretical context?
