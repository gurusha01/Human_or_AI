This paper introduces a piecewise constant parameterization for neural variational models, aiming to explore the multi-modality of latent variables and develop more robust neural models.  
The experiments conducted on neural variational document models and variational hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder models suggest that incorporating the piecewise constant distribution improves perplexity in document modeling and appears to enhance performance in dialogue modeling.  
While the concept of employing a piecewise constant prior for latent variables is intriguing, the paper is poorly written (despite being 14 pages long), and the experimental design falls short of substantiating many of the claims made.  
Detailed comments are as follows:  
--The authors discuss the limitations of VAEs with a standard Gaussian prior in the final paragraphs of Sections 3.1 and 5.1, suggesting that a multimodal prior could address optimization challenges. However, the paper lacks compelling evidence to demonstrate that the multimodality of the prior effectively overcomes these bottlenecks.  
--In the final paragraph of Section 6.1, the authors claim that the decoder parameter matrix is directly influenced by the latent variables. However, the connection to the decoder involves a combination of piecewise constant and Gaussian latent variables. Regardless of the experimental findings, this only demonstrates z=
