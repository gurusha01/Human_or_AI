This paper explores the use of convolutional neural network (convnet)-based object detection methods for identifying weather events in 3D climate data, while also investigating the impact of incorporating an unsupervised autoencoder-style objective term.
Strengths:
- To the best of my knowledge, applying object detection techniques to the problem of extreme weather event detection is novel.
- The paper is clearly written, providing a thorough explanation of the methodology and a comprehensive review of related work.
- The proposed approach leverages 3D convolutions and unsupervised learning, both of which are relatively underexplored in object detection literature. These components are validated and demonstrated to yield at least modest performance gains compared to a 2D and/or fully supervised approach.
Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements achieved by the 3D convolutional architecture and unsupervised learning are somewhat modest, with the 3D+semi-supervised model achieving 52.92% mAP compared to 51.42% mAP for the 2D+supervised baseline.
- It is unexpected that the 3D+supervised and 2D+semi-supervised models perform worse than the 2D+supervised baseline. One would anticipate that each individual enhancement would provide incremental improvements, given that their combination yields the best results. This discrepancy may indicate an insufficient hyperparameter search for these configurations. The authors do acknowledge this issue and offer potential explanations in Section 4.3.
- As noted by other reviewers, the use of a 0.1 IoU threshold for true positives is quite lenient compared to the standard 0.5 threshold. However, if the visualized results in Figure 3 are representative, the 0.1 overlap criterion might be reasonable for this domain, as the detector appears to localize events well enough to assist human reviewers in analyzing climate images for extreme events. Nevertheless, it would be valuable to include results at higher overlap thresholds for comparison.
Minor Comments:
- Equation 6 likely intends to represent the squared L2 norm (i.e., the sum of squared differences) rather than the L2 norm itself.
- In Table 4, the semi-supervised models should presumably have more parameters than their supervised counterparts due to the inclusion of decoder layers.
Summary:
This paper is well-written and introduces interesting, underutilized techniques to a relatively novel application domain. While the results are not particularly groundbreaking, the model is appropriately ablated, and its benefits are demonstrated. For the final version, it would be helpful to include results at higher IoU thresholds to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
