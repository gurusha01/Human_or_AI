The paper proposes a novel framework, Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), for solving inverse problems by directly learning a mapping from observations to reconstructed signals using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This approach abandons the traditional separation between modeling and inference, arguing that this dichotomy becomes irrelevant after training. The authors demonstrate that RIMs can outperform state-of-the-art methods on image reconstruction tasks such as denoising and super-resolution, while maintaining desirable convergence properties. The framework is positioned as a bridge between classical inverse problem-solving and deep learning, offering a scalable, modular, and efficient alternative to traditional methods.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance include: (1) the paper introduces a well-motivated and innovative approach to solving inverse problems, addressing a significant limitation in existing methods by jointly learning model and inference components. (2) The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs across multiple tasks, showing superior performance over baselines and state-of-the-art methods. The work is scientifically rigorous, with clear experimental design and detailed comparisons.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Significance and Novelty: The paper tackles the fundamental challenge of modularity in inverse problems, presenting a paradigm shift by integrating model and inference learning. This is a meaningful contribution to both the inverse problems and deep learning communities.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse tasks (denoising, super-resolution) and datasets. The results consistently show that RIMs outperform baselines, including traditional and deep learning-based methods, in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, including detailed derivations of the RIM framework and its connections to existing methods like LISTA and gradient-based optimization.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Motivation: While the paper argues against separating modeling and inference, it could further clarify why this separation is inherently problematic in practice. Including specific examples where traditional methods fail due to this separation would strengthen the motivation.
2. Ablation Studies: The paper includes some ablation studies (e.g., comparing RIM to GDN and FFN), but additional experiments isolating the impact of specific components (e.g., the state variable in RNNs) would provide deeper insights into the framework's effectiveness.
3. Broader Applicability: Although the paper mentions potential applications in fields like medical imaging, it would benefit from a discussion or preliminary experiments on non-linear inverse problems to demonstrate the generality of the RIM framework.
4. Computational Efficiency: While the paper highlights scalability, a more detailed analysis of computational costs (e.g., training time, inference speed) compared to baselines would be valuable for practitioners.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of RIMs scale with larger datasets or higher-dimensional problems? Are there any limitations in terms of computational resources or memory?
2. Can the RIM framework handle non-linear inverse problems effectively, and if so, how does it compare to state-of-the-art methods in such settings?
3. How sensitive is the performance of RIMs to the choice of RNN architecture (e.g., GRU vs. LSTM) or hyperparameters like the number of iterations during training?
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is recommended for acceptance, with minor revisions to address the suggested improvements and questions.
