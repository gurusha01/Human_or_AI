Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper revisits the challenges of distributed training for deep learning models, specifically addressing the trade-offs between asynchronous and synchronous stochastic optimization. The authors propose a novel approach: synchronous stochastic optimization with backup workers, which mitigates the straggler problem associated with synchronous training while avoiding the gradient staleness inherent in asynchronous methods. The paper makes several contributions, including empirical evidence of gradient staleness in asynchronous training, analysis of straggler effects in synchronous training, and experimental validation of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster convergence and better test accuracy compared to asynchronous methods, particularly on large-scale models like Inception and PixelCNN.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, addresses a significant problem in distributed training, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. The proposed method is novel, practical, and has the potential to impact real-world distributed training systems. The combination of theoretical insights and rigorous experimental validation makes this paper a valuable contribution to the field.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Problem: The paper clearly identifies the limitations of both asynchronous and synchronous methods, grounding its motivation in empirical observations and theoretical insights. The focus on mitigating stragglers without introducing gradient staleness is a compelling and practical contribution.
2. Strong Empirical Validation: The experiments are comprehensive, spanning multiple models (Inception, PixelCNN) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10). The results consistently show that the proposed method outperforms asynchronous optimization in terms of both convergence speed and final test accuracy.
3. Novelty and Practicality: The use of backup workers to address the straggler problem is a simple yet effective idea. The method is well-suited for large-scale distributed systems and integrates seamlessly with existing frameworks like TensorFlow.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Theoretical Analysis: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a more detailed theoretical analysis of the trade-offs between straggler mitigation and gradient variance. For example, a formal derivation of the optimal number of backup workers (b) under different system conditions would strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Comparison with Related Work: The related work section is thorough, but the experimental comparisons could include more baselines, such as "softsync" or other hybrid approaches. This would provide a clearer picture of where the proposed method stands relative to existing solutions.
3. Scalability Analysis: The paper demonstrates scalability up to 212 workers, but it would be helpful to discuss how the method would perform at even larger scales (e.g., thousands of workers). Are there diminishing returns as the number of backup workers increases?
4. Communication Overhead: The paper briefly mentions communication overhead but does not quantify it. A detailed analysis of how backup workers impact communication costs would provide a more holistic evaluation of the method.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of the number of backup workers (b)? Is there a systematic way to determine the optimal value of b for a given system?
2. Did you observe any scenarios where the proposed method underperformed compared to asynchronous optimization? If so, what were the contributing factors?
3. Could the method be extended to other types of distributed optimization algorithms beyond stochastic gradient descent (e.g., second-order methods)?
4. How does the proposed method handle dynamic changes in worker performance, such as temporary network slowdowns or hardware failures?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to distributed training and provides a practical solution to a long-standing challenge. With minor improvements and clarifications, it has the potential to become a highly impactful work in the field.
