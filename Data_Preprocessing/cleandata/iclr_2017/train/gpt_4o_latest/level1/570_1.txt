Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces the "Neural Answer Construction Model," which addresses two key challenges in non-factoid question answering (QA) systems: (1) the inability of current methods to handle context-dependent word ambiguities, and (2) the limitation of existing approaches to only select answers from QA site databases rather than generate new ones. The proposed model incorporates semantic biases into word embeddings to better understand context-specific word usage and employs a biLSTM-based architecture with attention mechanisms to construct answers by combining sentences that align with the question's context. The model is evaluated on the "Love Advice" category from the Japanese QA site Oshiete goo, achieving a 20% improvement in answer construction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. The paper also demonstrates the practical applicability of the model, as it has been deployed in a real-world QA service.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel approach to bridging the gap between answer selection and generation for non-factoid QA tasks. The method is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates significant empirical improvements over existing baselines.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Significance and Novelty: The paper addresses a critical gap in non-factoid QA by proposing a model that not only selects but also generates answers tailored to the question's context. This is a significant advancement over existing methods that rely solely on answer selection.
   
2. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a thorough review of related work, clearly identifying the limitations of current methods and situating their contribution within the broader literature. The use of semantic biases in word embeddings and the design of a joint neural network for sentence selection and combination are well-justified and innovative.
3. Empirical Rigor: The evaluation is comprehensive, using both automatic metrics (e.g., Average Precision) and human judgments to validate the model's effectiveness. The results consistently show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in both answer selection and construction tasks.
4. Practical Impact: The deployment of the model in a real-world QA service and its positive reception by users underscore the practical relevance of the work.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Explanation: While the method is described in detail, certain sections, such as the attention mechanism and loss function, are overly dense and could benefit from simplification or additional diagrams to improve readability.
2. Generalizability: The paper focuses exclusively on the "Love Advice" category. It would be helpful to include preliminary results or discussions on how the model performs in other categories or domains to demonstrate its generalizability.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper compares the proposed method to baselines, an ablation study isolating the contributions of the semantic word embeddings, attention mechanism, and joint optimization would strengthen the claims.
4. Error Analysis: A qualitative analysis of failure cases would provide insights into the model's limitations and potential areas for improvement.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model handle questions that fall outside the predefined abstract scenarios for answer construction? Can the method be extended to dynamically adapt to new scenarios?
2. The paper mentions that the model is language-independent. Have you tested it on datasets in other languages, and if so, how does it perform compared to Japanese?
3. How sensitive is the model to the quality of the semantic biases (e.g., category and title tokens)? Would it still perform well if these biases were noisy or incomplete?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of non-factoid QA by proposing a novel and effective method for answer construction. With minor improvements in clarity and additional experiments to demonstrate generalizability, the work has the potential to set a new benchmark in this area.
