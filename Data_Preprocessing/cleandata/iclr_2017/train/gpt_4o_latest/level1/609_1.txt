Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graph-structured data, addressing the challenge of applying CNNs to data lacking a low-dimensional grid structure. The authors introduce a new convolution framework that uses random walks to select relevant nodes for convolution and shares weights across features to ensure parameter efficiency. The method is computationally efficient, with additional preprocessing steps performed only once. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed Graph CNN on two datasets: the Merck Molecular Activity dataset (for regression) and MNIST (for classification). The results show competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods, particularly in scenarios where graph structures vary across observations.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by proposing an efficient and generalizable convolution operation for graph-structured data. The novelty of the approach, its empirical validation on diverse datasets, and its potential to extend CNNs to non-grid data structures justify acceptance. However, the paper could benefit from additional clarity and further exploration of certain aspects, as outlined below.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-motivated problem of extending CNNs to graph-structured data, which is a critical challenge in domains like molecular biology and social networks. The proposed method is innovative, particularly in its use of random walks to define local receptive fields and its ability to handle varying graph structures.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on the Merck Molecular Activity dataset and MNIST demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. The results are competitive with or better than state-of-the-art methods, particularly in regression tasks. The authors also highlight the parameter efficiency of their approach compared to fully connected networks.
3. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is grounded in graph theory and stochastic processes, and the authors provide a detailed explanation of their approach. The use of established benchmarks (e.g., MNIST) and comparisons with existing methods strengthen the validity of the claims.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Presentation: The paper is dense, and some sections (e.g., the mathematical formulation of the convolution operation) could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids. For instance, a diagram illustrating the random walk-based neighbor selection process would help readers unfamiliar with graph theory.
2. Graph Learning: While the authors acknowledge that learning the graph structure is beyond the scope of the paper, this is a critical aspect of applying the method in real-world scenarios. A brief discussion of how existing graph learning methods could integrate with the proposed framework would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
3. Pooling on Graphs: The authors mention that efficient pooling methods for graphs are a direction for future work. Including preliminary ideas or experiments on pooling would strengthen the paper's contribution and provide a more complete framework.
4. Broader Comparisons: While the paper compares its method to spectral approaches and fully connected networks, additional comparisons with other recent graph-based methods (e.g., Graph Neural Networks or Graph Attention Networks) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of neighbors (p) or the power of the transition matrix (k)? Could you provide guidelines for selecting these values in practice?
2. Have you considered applying the method to other graph-structured datasets, such as citation networks or social networks? If so, how does it perform in these domains?
3. Can the proposed convolution framework be extended to incorporate edge features or directed graphs? If not, what modifications would be required?
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up exciting avenues for future research. With some refinements and additional context, it has the potential to significantly impact the application of deep learning to graph-structured data.
