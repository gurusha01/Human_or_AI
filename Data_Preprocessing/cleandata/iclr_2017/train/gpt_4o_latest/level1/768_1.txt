The paper proposes a novel Group Orthogonal Convolutional Neural Network (GoCNN) that leverages auxiliary annotations, such as segmentation masks, as privileged information during training to enhance feature diversity and improve generalization in image classification tasks. By explicitly enforcing orthogonality between feature groups (foreground and background), the model aims to maximize inherent diversity within a single CNN, thereby addressing the redundancy often observed in standard architectures. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of GoCNN through experiments on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets, showing significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to baseline models. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the utility of background information and segmentation annotations in training more robust CNNs.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance are the novelty of the proposed approach and its demonstrated effectiveness. The paper introduces a principled method to explicitly encourage feature diversity within a single CNN, which is a relatively underexplored area. Furthermore, the experimental results are compelling, showing consistent performance improvements across datasets and settings, including scenarios with partial privileged information.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-motivated problem—maximizing feature diversity within a single CNN—by introducing group orthogonality constraints. The use of segmentation annotations as privileged information is innovative and well-placed in the context of existing literature, filling a gap in how auxiliary annotations can be utilized for classification tasks.
2. Scientific Rigor: The proposed method is clearly described, and the mathematical formulation of group-wise model diversity is sound. The experiments are thorough, covering both complete and partial privileged information scenarios, and the results are statistically significant. The visualization of feature maps further supports the claim that GoCNN learns more diverse and discriminative features.
3. Broader Impact: The paper provides positive answers to two important questions in computer vision—whether background information aids object recognition and whether segmentation annotations can assist classification training. These insights are valuable for the broader research community.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, some sections, particularly the mathematical formulations (e.g., Definitions 1 and 2), could benefit from additional explanations or examples to improve accessibility for readers less familiar with the topic.
2. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper primarily compares GoCNN with ResNet and SVM+. Including comparisons with other diversity-promoting methods, such as DeCov or knowledge distillation approaches, would strengthen the evaluation.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper includes some component-wise analysis, a more detailed ablation study on the impact of the group size ratio (foreground vs. background) and the suppression term would provide deeper insights into the design choices.
4. Scalability Discussion: The experiments primarily focus on ResNet-18 and ResNet-152. A discussion on the scalability of GoCNN to other architectures (e.g., vision transformers) would enhance the paper's relevance to a broader audience.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is the performance of GoCNN to the choice of the foreground-to-background group size ratio (3:1)? Would a different ratio affect the results significantly?
2. Can the proposed method be extended to tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or semantic segmentation? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How does the computational overhead of GoCNN during training compare to baseline models, especially for larger datasets and deeper architectures?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision by proposing a novel method to enhance feature diversity using privileged information. With minor improvements in presentation and additional comparisons, the work has the potential to make a strong impact in the community.
