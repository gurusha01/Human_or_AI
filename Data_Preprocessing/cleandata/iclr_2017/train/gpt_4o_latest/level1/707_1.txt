The paper proposes a novel framework for reference-aware language models that explicitly incorporate reference decisions as stochastic latent variables. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach across three diverse tasks: dialogue modeling with database support, recipe generation from ingredient lists, and coreference-aware language modeling. The paper claims that this explicit modeling of references improves the ability of language models to handle rare words and structured information, outperforming deterministic attention-based baselines. Key contributions include the introduction of a general framework for reference-aware modeling, the creation of three task-specific datasets, and comprehensive evaluations that highlight the superiority of the proposed models.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted due to its innovative approach to modeling reference in language tasks and its strong empirical results. The explicit treatment of reference decisions as latent variables is a significant advancement over existing attention-based methods, and the results convincingly demonstrate the benefits of this approach across multiple tasks. Additionally, the creation of new datasets tailored to these tasks is a valuable contribution to the research community.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-motivated gap in the literature by explicitly modeling references, which are crucial for tasks involving structured data or long-term dependencies. The approach is innovative and extends beyond traditional attention mechanisms by introducing stochastic latent variables.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough and demonstrate consistent improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores across all tasks. The use of diverse tasks (dialogue, recipe generation, and coreference) strengthens the generalizability of the proposed framework.
3. Datasets: The authors' effort to create and preprocess datasets for these tasks is commendable, as it provides a foundation for future research in this area.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Model Description: While the technical details are comprehensive, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of the key components, particularly the latent variable modeling and its integration with the RNN and attention mechanisms. Simplified diagrams or pseudocode could help readers unfamiliar with these concepts.
2. Human Evaluation for Dialogue: The authors mention the potential for human evaluation in task-oriented dialogues but do not include it in the current work. Incorporating human evaluation would strengthen the claims about the practical utility of the model.
3. Error Analysis: The paper could include a more detailed error analysis to identify specific cases where the proposed model outperforms or underperforms compared to baselines. This would provide deeper insights into the model's behavior.
4. Reinforcement Learning: The authors suggest reinforcement learning as a future direction but do not explore it in the current work. A brief discussion of its potential impact on the results would be valuable.
Questions for Authors:
1. How sensitive is the model to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly for the latent variable components? Did you observe any stability issues during training?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to handle multimodal data (e.g., text and images) where references might involve visual elements?
3. How does the model perform in real-world settings where database entries or coreference annotations may be noisy or incomplete?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of language modeling by addressing an important problem with a novel and well-evaluated approach. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the work justify its acceptance.
