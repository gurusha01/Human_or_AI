Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper presents a comprehensive study on the factors influencing the effectiveness of image features extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for instance-level image retrieval. The authors identify five key factors—feature aggregation and normalization, output layer selection, image resizing, multi-scale feature representation, and PCA/whitening—and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate their impact. Based on these insights, the paper proposes a new multi-scale image representation method that is compact yet effective. The method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art approaches on four widely-used datasets (Oxford5k, Paris6k, Oxford105k, and UKB). Additionally, the authors introduce a "layer ensemble" technique that combines features from different layers to further boost performance. The work is well-motivated, as it addresses the lack of systematic evaluation of design choices in CNN-based image retrieval, and provides actionable recommendations for practitioners.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted because it makes a significant contribution to the field of instance-level image retrieval by systematically analyzing key factors that affect feature representation. The proposed multi-scale representation method and layer ensemble demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods, and the experimental results are robust and convincing. The work is also well-placed in the literature, building on and extending prior research in a meaningful way.
Supporting Arguments
1. Thorough Evaluation: The paper systematically evaluates five critical factors, providing detailed insights into their impact on retrieval performance. This level of rigor is commendable and fills a gap in the literature.
2. Strong Results: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with significant improvements in mean average precision (mAP) and retrieval accuracy. The results are consistent and scientifically rigorous.
3. Practical Contributions: The recommendations for feature aggregation, layer selection, and PCA/whitening are practical and directly applicable to real-world image retrieval tasks. The multi-scale representation method is computationally efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Experimental Design: While the experiments are thorough, the paper could benefit from clearer descriptions of some experimental setups, particularly in the multi-scale representation section. For example, the rationale behind specific choices for overlapping regions in the pyramid could be elaborated further.
2. Comparison with More Baselines: Although the paper compares its method with several state-of-the-art approaches, including additional baselines (e.g., methods using different CNN architectures like ResNet or Vision Transformers) would strengthen the claims.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper evaluates individual factors, it would be helpful to include ablation studies that show how performance changes when multiple factors are combined or excluded.
4. Generalization to Other Tasks: The paper focuses on instance-level image retrieval. It would be interesting to discuss whether the proposed method generalizes to other tasks, such as object detection or semantic segmentation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform when applied to CNN architectures other than VGG-19, such as ResNet or EfficientNet? Would the insights from the five factors still hold?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the computational cost of their method, especially for large-scale datasets like Oxford105k? How does it compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency?
3. The paper mentions that PCA and whitening matrices should be learned on a similar dataset for optimal performance. Could the authors provide guidance on how to identify a "similar" dataset in practice?
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and provides both theoretical insights and practical advancements. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, it could be even more impactful.
