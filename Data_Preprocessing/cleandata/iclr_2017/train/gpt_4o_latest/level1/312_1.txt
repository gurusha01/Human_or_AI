The paper introduces Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a method that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with reinforcement learning to automatically design neural network architectures. The authors claim that NAS can generate novel architectures for image classification and language modeling tasks that outperform or rival state-of-the-art human-designed architectures. On CIFAR-10, the method achieves a test error rate of 3.65%, slightly better than the best human-designed model, while being 1.05x faster. For language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset, the NAS-designed recurrent cell achieves a test perplexity of 62.4, outperforming the widely-used LSTM cell and other baselines. The paper also demonstrates the transferability of the discovered architectures to other tasks, such as character language modeling and machine translation.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contribution to automating neural architecture design, a challenging and impactful problem in machine learning. The method is novel, well-motivated, and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, demonstrating both empirical rigor and practical relevance.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Tackling and Motivation: The paper addresses the critical problem of automating neural architecture design, which is currently time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. The use of reinforcement learning to optimize architecture search is well-motivated and builds on prior work in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning.
   
2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are compelling. On CIFAR-10, the NAS-designed architecture achieves competitive accuracy while being computationally efficient. On Penn Treebank, the discovered recurrent cell significantly outperforms LSTM and other baselines, with results validated through transfer learning and control experiments.
3. Scientific Contribution: The paper introduces a flexible, scalable framework for architecture search that can handle variable-length architectures. The use of distributed training and skip connections further enhances the method's practicality and robustness.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Search Space Exploration: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of NAS, it would be helpful to provide more insights into the search space. For instance, how sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameter ranges or the addition of new functions (e.g., max, sin)? A deeper analysis of the search dynamics could strengthen the paper.
2. Computational Cost: The method relies on training thousands of child networks, which requires substantial computational resources (e.g., 800 GPUs for CIFAR-10). While distributed training mitigates this, a discussion on the feasibility of NAS for researchers with limited resources would be valuable.
3. Reproducibility: The authors mention plans to release code, but providing more implementation details (e.g., hyperparameter settings, training schedules) in the paper itself would enhance reproducibility.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the method perform when computational resources are constrained (e.g., fewer GPUs or CPUs)? Could the search process be made more efficient without significantly compromising performance?
2. How generalizable is the NAS framework to other domains (e.g., reinforcement learning, time-series forecasting)? Are there any limitations or challenges in extending it to these areas?
3. Can the discovered architectures be further fine-tuned manually to achieve better performance, or does the method already find near-optimal solutions?
Overall, this paper represents a significant step forward in automated machine learning and neural architecture design. Addressing the above suggestions and questions could further strengthen its impact.
