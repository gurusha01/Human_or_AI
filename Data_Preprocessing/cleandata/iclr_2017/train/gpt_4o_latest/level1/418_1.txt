Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel method to stabilize the training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by unrolling the optimization of the discriminator during generator updates. This approach addresses key challenges in GAN training, such as mode collapse and instability, by interpolating between the standard GAN training dynamics and the idealized scenario of using an optimal discriminator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across several datasets, including toy examples (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians), challenging architectures (e.g., recurrent neural networks), and more complex image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10). The paper provides both qualitative and quantitative evidence that unrolling improves mode coverage, reduces mode collapse, and enhances stability. The authors also highlight the computational trade-offs of their approach and suggest potential extensions.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its well-motivated approach, rigorous experimental validation, and significant contribution to improving GAN training. The method addresses a critical problem in GAN research and demonstrates clear improvements over baseline methods.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Significance and Novelty: The instability of GAN training and mode collapse are well-documented challenges in the field. The proposed unrolling technique is novel and provides a principled way to mitigate these issues by incorporating the discriminator's response into the generator's updates.
2. Experimental Rigor: The authors present a comprehensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and architectures. The results consistently show that unrolling improves mode coverage and stability, with clear evidence from metrics such as KL divergence, JS divergence, and pairwise distance distributions.
3. Theoretical Motivation: The paper is well-grounded in theory, with clear derivations of the surrogate loss function and its gradient. The authors also provide a detailed discussion of the trade-offs and limitations of their approach, which strengthens the credibility of their claims.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Computational Overhead: While the authors acknowledge the increased computational cost of unrolling, further discussion on how this cost scales with larger datasets or more complex architectures would be valuable. Are there scenarios where the method becomes impractical?
2. Evaluation Metrics: Although the paper uses several metrics to evaluate diversity and stability, the reliance on heuristic measures (e.g., Inception score) could be complemented with more robust metrics, such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), to strengthen the evaluation.
3. Ablation Studies: The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies to isolate the impact of specific components, such as the number of unrolling steps or the choice of optimizer. For example, how does the performance degrade with fewer unrolling steps?
4. Broader Applicability: The method is primarily tested on image datasets. It would be interesting to see its applicability to other domains, such as text or audio generation, where GANs are also used.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method scale with larger datasets or higher-dimensional data distributions? Are there practical limits to the number of unrolling steps that can be used?
2. Did the authors experiment with unrolling the generator's optimization in addition to the discriminator's? If so, what were the results, and how did they compare to the current approach?
3. Could the authors provide more insights into the trade-off between computational cost and performance improvement? For instance, is there a diminishing return on performance gains as the number of unrolling steps increases?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of GAN research and provides a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in GAN training. With minor revisions and clarifications, the paper will be a strong addition to the conference.
