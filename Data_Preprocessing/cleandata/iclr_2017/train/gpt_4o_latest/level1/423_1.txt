The paper introduces the Generative Multi-Adversarial Network (GMAN), a novel extension of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that incorporates multiple discriminators. The authors claim that GMAN addresses the challenges of GAN training by enabling the use of the original minimax objective without modifications, which is traditionally difficult due to unstable dynamics. GMAN is proposed to accelerate convergence and improve the quality of generated samples by leveraging multiple discriminators that act as either formidable adversaries or forgiving teachers. The paper also introduces the Generative Multi-Adversarial Metric (GMAM) for evaluating GMAN's performance and demonstrates its effectiveness on image generation tasks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance:
1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of multiple discriminators in GANs is a significant and well-motivated extension that addresses known issues in GAN training, such as instability and mode collapse.
2. Empirical Validation: The paper provides rigorous experimental results showing that GMAN achieves faster convergence and higher-quality outputs compared to standard GANs, as measured by the proposed GMAM metric.
Supporting Arguments:
1. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on foundational GAN research and addressing critical challenges such as the difficulty of training with the original minimax objective. It situates its contributions within the context of prior work on adversarial training and GAN extensions.
2. The proposed GMAN framework is theoretically grounded, with detailed explanations of its design choices (e.g., softmax-based discriminators, boosting, and ensemble approaches). The empirical results are compelling, showing consistent improvements across datasets.
3. The introduction of GMAM as a metric for evaluating multi-discriminator frameworks is a valuable addition to the field, addressing the lack of robust evaluation methods for GANs.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity on Diversity of Discriminators: The paper mentions varying dropout rates and network depths to maintain discriminator diversity. However, it would be helpful to provide more quantitative analysis or ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of these variations on performance.
2. Scalability Analysis: While the experiments use up to five discriminators, the paper does not discuss the computational overhead of scaling GMAN to larger ensembles. Including a discussion or experiments on scalability would strengthen the practical applicability of the approach.
3. Comparison with Other GAN Variants: The paper could include comparisons with other recent GAN extensions, such as Wasserstein GANs or StyleGAN, to contextualize GMAN's performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is GMAN to the choice of the softmax parameter λ? Does the performance degrade significantly if λ is not tuned appropriately?
2. Could the authors provide more details on the computational cost of training GMAN compared to standard GANs? Specifically, how does the addition of multiple discriminators affect training time and resource usage?
3. How does GMAN handle datasets with higher complexity (e.g., ImageNet)? Are there any limitations in extending the framework to such datasets?
In summary, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of GAN research by addressing key challenges in training stability and evaluation. While there are areas for further clarification and exploration, the novelty and empirical rigor of the work warrant its acceptance.
