Review of "Intrinsic Fear: Mitigating Catastrophic Failures in Deep Reinforcement Learning"
Summary of Contributions
The paper addresses a critical problem in deep reinforcement learning (DRL): the tendency of agents to periodically revisit catastrophic mistakes due to the limitations of function approximation, a phenomenon the authors term the "Sisyphean curse." The authors propose a novel approach called intrinsic fear, which introduces a supervised danger model to predict states likely to lead to catastrophic outcomes. This danger model penalizes the Q-learning objective, shaping the reward function to steer the agent away from dangerous states. The paper demonstrates the failure of standard deep Q-networks (DQNs) in avoiding catastrophic states across toy environments (Adventure Seeker and Cart-Pole) and presents experimental evidence that intrinsic fear significantly mitigates these issues. Preliminary results on the Atari game Seaquest further suggest the potential applicability of the method in more complex environments. The work is well-motivated by real-world safety concerns, such as self-driving cars and domestic robots, and contributes to the growing literature on safe reinforcement learning.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Importance: The paper tackles a fundamental and underexplored issue in DRLâ€”catastrophic forgetting and oscillating policies in safety-critical applications. The proposed solution, intrinsic fear, is both innovative and practical.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the failure of standard DQNs and the effectiveness of intrinsic fear in mitigating these failures across diverse environments.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Significance: The paper highlights a critical limitation of DRL algorithms in real-world applications where safety is paramount. The authors' framing of the "Sisyphean curse" is compelling and well-supported by empirical evidence.
2. Methodological Soundness: The intrinsic fear approach is well-motivated, leveraging a supervised danger model to penalize dangerous states. The authors provide theoretical justification for why this method does not alter the optimal policy under certain assumptions.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough and include both toy problems and a more complex domain (Seaquest). The results clearly show that intrinsic fear reduces catastrophic events while maintaining or improving overall performance.
4. Positioning in Literature: The paper situates itself well within the fields of safe reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and intrinsic motivation, providing a clear distinction from prior work.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarification of Assumptions: The paper assumes the existence of a catastrophe detector and prior knowledge of a fear radius (kr). While these assumptions are reasonable in some domains, their implications for generalizability should be discussed in greater depth. How sensitive is the method to the choice of kr, and how might it be determined in practice?
2. Scalability to Complex Domains: While the preliminary results on Seaquest are promising, the paper would benefit from additional experiments on more complex, real-world environments to better assess the scalability of intrinsic fear.
3. Comparison with Alternative Methods: The paper briefly mentions memory-based approaches but does not provide a detailed comparison. Including baselines such as risk-sensitive RL or constrained policy optimization would strengthen the empirical evaluation.
4. Formalization of Danger Zones: The authors note the need for a formal definition of danger zones and proximity but leave this as future work. A more precise characterization would enhance the theoretical contribution of the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the intrinsic fear model handle false positives in the danger model? For example, could overly conservative danger predictions hinder exploration and lead to suboptimal policies?
2. What are the computational overheads of training and maintaining the danger model alongside the DQN? How do these scale with the complexity of the state space?
3. Could the method be extended to multi-agent environments or continuous action spaces? If so, what modifications would be required?
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of safe reinforcement learning by addressing a critical limitation of DQNs and proposing a novel, empirically validated solution. While there are areas for further exploration and refinement, the work is a strong candidate for acceptance.
