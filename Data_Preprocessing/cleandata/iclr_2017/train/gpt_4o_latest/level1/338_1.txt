Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper provides a novel perspective on the functioning of Highway and Residual networks, proposing that these architectures perform "unrolled iterative estimation" rather than adhering strictly to the traditional "representation view" of deep learning. The authors argue that successive layers within a stage iteratively refine a single level of representation rather than computing entirely new representations at each layer. They provide a mathematical framework to derive both Highway and Residual networks from this perspective and present empirical evidence supporting their claims. The paper also compares the two architectures in terms of training dynamics, parameter efficiency, and task-specific performance, offering insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. The authors conclude that the iterative estimation view reconciles several findings in the literature, such as resilience to lesioning and the effects of layer reshuffling, while providing a unified framework for understanding these architectures.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a compelling theoretical and empirical contribution by introducing a new perspective on the functioning of deep architectures like Highway and Residual networks. The iterative estimation view is well-motivated, mathematically grounded, and supported by experimental results. It challenges and extends the conventional representation view, offering a fresh lens to interpret the design and behavior of these networks. The clarity of the writing, the rigor of the analysis, and the relevance of the topic to the deep learning community justify its acceptance.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novel Contribution: The iterative estimation view is a significant theoretical advancement that unifies the understanding of Highway and Residual networks. By deriving these architectures from a common framework, the paper provides a deeper insight into their shared principles and differences.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly support the claims made in the paper. For example, the analysis of estimation errors within Residual blocks and the comparison of Highway and Residual networks on tasks like image classification and language modeling are thorough and well-executed.
3. Relevance and Impact: The findings have broad implications for the design and optimization of deep architectures, addressing key challenges such as training stability, parameter efficiency, and task-specific adaptability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Experimental Design: While the experiments are well-conducted, the description of the experimental setup, particularly for the image classification task, could be more detailed. For instance, providing more information about the training hyperparameters and dataset preprocessing would improve reproducibility.
2. Broader Comparison: The paper focuses primarily on Highway and Residual networks. Including comparisons with other architectures, such as DenseNets or Transformers, could strengthen the generalizability of the iterative estimation view.
3. Visualization: The paper would benefit from additional visualizations to illustrate the iterative refinement process within layers. For example, more examples of feature visualizations across stages could make the concept more accessible to readers.
4. Discussion of Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that the iterative estimation view is a starting point for further investigation, a more explicit discussion of its limitations and potential challenges in extending this framework to other architectures would be valuable.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the iterative estimation view apply to architectures that do not use skip connections, such as traditional feedforward networks? Could this perspective be extended to explain their behavior?
2. The experiments suggest that Highway networks can perform comparably to Residual networks under certain conditions. Are there specific tasks or scenarios where one architecture is clearly superior to the other?
3. How sensitive are the experimental results to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the initial bias for the transform gate in Highway networks? Would different initialization strategies affect the conclusions?
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the understanding of deep architectures and is a valuable addition to the field. With minor improvements, it could have an even greater impact.
