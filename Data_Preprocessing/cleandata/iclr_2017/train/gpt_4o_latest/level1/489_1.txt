Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing sentence embeddings by focusing on low-level sentence properties such as length, word content, and word order. The authors introduce auxiliary prediction tasks to evaluate the extent to which these properties are encoded in sentence representations. The methodology is applied to compare Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW), LSTM-based auto-encoders, and skip-thought vectors. Key findings include the surprising effectiveness of CBOW in encoding sentence length and word order, the nuanced trade-offs in LSTM performance with increasing dimensionality, and the reliance of skip-thought vectors on natural language word order. The paper also highlights the limitations of BLEU scores in evaluating encoder quality and provides actionable insights for selecting sentence embedding methods based on task requirements.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and makes a significant contribution to the understanding of sentence embeddings. The proposed framework fills a gap in the literature by offering a fine-grained, task-independent analysis of sentence representations, which complements existing evaluation methods. The findings are both scientifically rigorous and practically relevant, offering insights that could guide future research and applications in natural language processing (NLP).
Supporting Arguments
1. Clear Problem Definition and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical gap in the NLP literatureâ€”understanding the properties encoded in sentence embeddings. The motivation is well-articulated, and the proposed framework is positioned as a complementary approach to existing evaluation methods, such as downstream task performance.
   
2. Methodological Rigor: The auxiliary prediction tasks are well-designed to isolate specific properties of sentence embeddings, and the experimental setup is robust, with a large dataset and multiple embedding methods tested. The use of synthetic datasets to control for natural language effects further strengthens the analysis.
3. Insightful Findings: The results provide actionable insights, such as the unexpected effectiveness of CBOW for certain tasks and the limitations of BLEU scores in evaluating encoder quality. These findings are both surprising and valuable, demonstrating the utility of the proposed framework.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Scope of Properties: While the focus on low-level properties is justified, the paper would benefit from a discussion on how the framework could be extended to higher-level semantic and syntactic properties. This would make the methodology more comprehensive and its applications broader.
2. Comparison with More Models: The analysis is limited to CBOW, LSTM auto-encoders, and skip-thought vectors. Including more recent models, such as Transformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT), would enhance the paper's relevance and impact.
3. Clarity in Presentation: Some sections, particularly those discussing the experimental results, could be more concise. For instance, the detailed breakdown of results across embedding dimensions could be summarized in a table or figure for easier interpretation.
4. Generalizability: The authors acknowledge the limitation that their findings may not generalize beyond the datasets used. Including experiments on additional datasets or languages would strengthen the claims.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed framework perform when applied to higher-level properties, such as semantic similarity or syntactic parsing? Are there plans to extend the methodology in this direction?
2. Have you considered applying the framework to Transformer-based embeddings? If so, how do these models compare to the ones analyzed in the paper?
3. Could the reliance of skip-thought vectors on natural language word order be mitigated by training on permuted datasets? Would this improve their generalizability?
In conclusion, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by providing a novel and insightful framework for analyzing sentence embeddings. While there is room for improvement and expansion, the current work is robust and impactful, warranting acceptance to the conference.
