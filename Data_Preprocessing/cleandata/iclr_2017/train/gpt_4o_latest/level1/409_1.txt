The paper introduces MusicNet, a large-scale, publicly available dataset for classical music research, addressing the lack of sufficient labeled data for supervised learning in music informatics. MusicNet comprises 34 hours of freely licensed recordings with over 1.2 million temporal labels, enabling tasks such as note prediction and feature learning. The authors propose a multi-label classification task for note prediction and evaluate several machine learning models, including spectrogram-based and end-to-end neural networks. Their results demonstrate that end-to-end models can learn frequency-selective filters, outperforming spectrogram features in some cases. The dataset and benchmarks aim to catalyze progress in music research by providing a robust resource for supervised learning.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted primarily because it makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a high-quality, large-scale dataset that fills a critical gap in music informatics. Additionally, the authors provide a well-defined evaluation protocol and benchmark results, making the dataset immediately useful for the community. The scientific rigor in constructing the dataset and evaluating models is evident, and the paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing a long-standing need for labeled music data.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Significance: The lack of large, publicly available datasets for music research has hindered progress in applying modern machine learning techniques. MusicNet addresses this gap, similar to how datasets like ImageNet transformed computer vision.
2. Scientific Rigor: The dataset construction process, including the use of dynamic time warping for alignment and careful parameter tuning, is well-documented. The experiments are thorough, comparing multiple architectures and providing insights into feature learning.
3. Impact Potential: By making MusicNet publicly available, the authors enable reproducibility and provide a foundation for future research in music informatics, including note prediction, feature learning, and beyond.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Dataset Bias: The dataset is skewed towards Beethoven and solo piano recordings. While the authors acknowledge this, future work could explore strategies for balancing the dataset, such as augmenting underrepresented instruments like the flute and oboe.
2. Model Performance Analysis: While the paper shows that end-to-end models outperform spectrogram features, the performance gains are modest. A deeper analysis of why these models perform better and under what conditions would strengthen the paper.
3. Additional Benchmarks: Including results from more advanced architectures, such as transformers or self-supervised learning models, could provide a broader perspective on the dataset's utility.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the dataset handle variations in tempo and dynamics across recordings? Are there any preprocessing steps to normalize these factors?
2. Could you elaborate on the potential limitations of using synthesized MIDI scores for alignment? How might this impact the quality of the labels?
3. Are there plans to expand MusicNet to include other genres or modern instruments, such as electric guitars or synthesizers, to broaden its applicability?
In conclusion, the paper makes a valuable contribution by addressing a critical bottleneck in music research. While there are areas for improvement, the introduction of MusicNet is a significant step forward, and the paper merits acceptance.
