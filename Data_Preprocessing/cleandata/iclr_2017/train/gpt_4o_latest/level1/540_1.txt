Review of the Paper: "Network Morphism at a Higher Level"
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the problem of network morphism, specifically focusing on morphing a convolutional layer into an arbitrary module while preserving the network's function. The authors propose a novel graph-based abstraction to represent modules as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling the morphing process to be formulated as a graph transformation problem. Two atomic morphing operations are introduced, and modules are categorized into simple morphable and complex modules. The authors prove that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer and provide practical algorithms for both simple and complex cases. Extensive experiments on ResNet architectures demonstrate significant performance improvements on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, with minimal computational overhead. The paper makes a strong theoretical and practical contribution to the field of neural network architecture optimization.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and provides both theoretical insights and practical benefits. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contribution: The paper extends the concept of network morphism to the module level, providing a theoretical framework that proves the morphability of any module. This is a significant advancement over prior work, which focused on primitive, layer-level operations.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed approach, achieving substantial performance gains with minimal computational cost.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing limitations of previous work (e.g., Net2Net and NetMorph) that only considered layer-level morphing. The focus on modularized architectures aligns with the trend in modern deep learning models like ResNet and GoogLeNet.
2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical claims are supported by clear mathematical formulations, proofs, and algorithms. The proposed graph-based abstraction is elegant and effectively simplifies the problem.
3. Experimental Results: The experiments are thorough, covering multiple datasets and architectures. The results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance while being computationally efficient. The comparison with learning from scratch further highlights the advantages of the morphing approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Graph Abstraction: While the graph-based abstraction is a key strength, some parts of the explanation (e.g., the compatibility of network morphism equations) could benefit from additional examples or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the mathematical details.
2. Scalability Discussion: The paper could include a discussion on the scalability of the proposed approach to very large networks (e.g., GPT-like architectures) and its potential limitations in such scenarios.
3. Broader Implications: The authors could elaborate on how the proposed method might generalize to non-convolutional architectures, such as transformers or recurrent networks, to broaden the scope of the work.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method handle cases where the target module has significantly more parameters than the original convolutional layer? Are there any constraints on the size or complexity of the target module?
2. Can the proposed graph-based abstraction be extended to architectures with non-convolutional layers, such as attention mechanisms or recurrent layers? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. The experiments focus on ResNet architectures. Have you tested the method on other modularized architectures like EfficientNet or MobileNet? If not, do you anticipate any challenges in applying the method to these models?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of network morphism and neural architecture optimization. With minor clarifications and additional discussions, it will be a valuable addition to the conference.
