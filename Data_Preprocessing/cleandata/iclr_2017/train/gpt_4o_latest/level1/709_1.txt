Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel unsupervised pretraining method to enhance sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning by initializing the encoder and decoder with pretrained language models. This approach is applied to machine translation (English→German) and abstractive summarization tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in generalization and optimization. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on WMT'14 and WMT'15 English→German benchmarks, surpassing both neural and phrase-based machine translation systems by 1.3 BLEU points. For summarization, the method outperforms the supervised baseline. The authors also conduct ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components, such as pretraining the encoder versus the decoder, the importance of monolingual language modeling losses, and the use of residual connections. The paper is well-positioned in the literature, addressing the gap in leveraging unsupervised pretraining for seq2seq tasks, and provides a flexible framework applicable to various domains.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its strong empirical results, rigorous experimentation, and clear contribution to the field of seq2seq learning. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Significant Performance Gains: The method achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation and competitive results in summarization, demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks.
2. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides a thorough evaluation, including ablation studies and human evaluations, which validate the claims and offer insights into the method's strengths.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds on prior work in unsupervised pretraining and seq2seq learning, addressing the challenge of overfitting in low-resource settings. The use of pretrained language models for initialization is both intuitive and impactful, as shown by the results.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The experiments are conducted on large-scale datasets with rigorous benchmarks, and the results are compared against strong baselines. The ablation studies further clarify the contributions of individual components, such as pretraining the softmax layer and using residual connections.
3. Generality of the Method: The proposed approach is flexible and applicable to multiple tasks, as evidenced by its success in both machine translation and summarization.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Summarization Results: While the method matches the baseline in abstractive summarization, it does not outperform it significantly. The authors could explore using bidirectional LSTMs or longer contexts to address this limitation, as done in prior work.
2. Scalability: The computational cost of training large language models on monolingual corpora is high. A discussion on the trade-offs between performance gains and resource requirements would strengthen the paper.
3. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on machine translation and summarization. Extending the method to other seq2seq tasks, such as dialogue generation or question answering, could demonstrate its versatility further.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method perform on low-resource language pairs or domains with limited monolingual data? Could this approach be adapted for such scenarios?
2. In the summarization task, how does the performance compare when using pretrained embeddings like word2vec or GloVe instead of full language model pretraining?
3. Can the proposed method be combined with other semi-supervised techniques, such as backtranslation, to achieve additional gains in machine translation?
Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to seq2seq learning and is a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the suggestions and questions above could further enhance its impact.
