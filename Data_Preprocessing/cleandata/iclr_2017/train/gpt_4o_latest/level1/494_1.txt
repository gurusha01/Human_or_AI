The paper introduces a novel dataset based on Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs to facilitate the application of machine learning techniques in theorem proving. It claims to contribute by providing a publicly available dataset, proposing machine learning tasks relevant to theorem proving, and benchmarking baseline models for proof step classification. The dataset is extensive, containing over 2 million training examples, and is designed to address challenges in interactive theorem proving (ITP), such as proof step classification and premise selection. The authors also evaluate simple machine learning models, demonstrating the feasibility of using machine learning for theorem proving tasks and identifying areas for future improvement.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated and makes a significant contribution to the intersection of machine learning and theorem proving. The introduction of a specialized dataset and the benchmarking of baseline models provide a solid foundation for future research in this domain. The work is timely, given the growing interest in applying machine learning to formal reasoning tasks, and aligns with recent advancements in deep learning. However, the paper could benefit from addressing certain limitations in its current approach, as outlined below.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Relevance and Novelty: The paper tackles a well-defined and important problemâ€”bridging the gap between machine learning and theorem proving. The creation of a dataset specifically designed for HOL proofs is a novel contribution that fills a gap in the literature.
2. Scientific Rigor: The dataset is carefully constructed, and the baseline experiments are methodologically sound. The authors provide detailed descriptions of their models and experimental setup, ensuring reproducibility.
3. Impact Potential: By releasing the dataset and baseline code, the authors enable the research community to build upon their work, potentially accelerating progress in automated theorem proving.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Model Limitations: The baseline models, while informative, are relatively simple and fail to leverage the logical structure of the data. Future iterations could explore more sophisticated architectures, such as graph neural networks or models explicitly designed for reasoning tasks.
2. Generalization Across Systems: The dataset focuses solely on HOL Light. Expanding the dataset to include other theorem provers or foundational logics would enhance its applicability and generalizability.
3. Conditioning on Conjectures: The paper notes that conditioned models do not outperform unconditioned ones. This raises questions about the utility of conjecture information in the current setup. The authors should explore alternative ways to incorporate conjecture context, such as attention mechanisms or multi-task learning.
4. Evaluation Metrics: While accuracy is reported, additional metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) could provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance, particularly for imbalanced or complex tasks.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Can you elaborate on why the conditioned models fail to leverage conjecture information effectively? Are there specific architectural limitations or data preprocessing issues that might explain this?
2. How transferable do you expect the dataset and proposed tasks to be across different theorem proving systems? Have you considered any preliminary experiments with other systems?
3. Have you explored the potential of hybrid approaches that combine classical reasoning techniques with machine learning models, as suggested in your conclusion?
In summary, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field and provides a strong foundation for further research. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty and potential impact of the work justify its acceptance.
