Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions  
This paper investigates the use of Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Max-Product Networks (MPNs) for unsupervised representation learning and structured output prediction. The authors propose a novel interpretation of SPNs as hierarchical feature extractors and MPNs as generative autoencoders capable of decoding learned representations back into the input space. The paper introduces a decoding procedure leveraging Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference and characterizes conditions under which MPNs act as perfect encoder-decoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of SPN/MPN representations against other generative models like RBMs, MADEs, and MANIAC, particularly in multi-label classification tasks. The authors also evaluate the resilience of their decoding schemes to missing data, providing evidence for the robustness and practical utility of their approach.
Decision: Accept  
Key reasons for acceptance:  
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper provides a fresh perspective on SPNs and MPNs, extending their utility from probabilistic modeling to representation learning and structured prediction. The proposed decoding mechanism and its theoretical grounding are significant contributions.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets, metrics, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of SPN/MPN representations.  
Supporting Arguments  
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, building on prior work on SPNs while addressing a gap in their application to representation learning. The hierarchical nature of SPNs is effectively leveraged to extract meaningful features, and the decoding mechanism for MPNs is both innovative and practical.  
2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical claims, such as conditions for perfect encoder-decoder behavior, are clearly stated and supported by empirical evidence. The experiments are thorough, with appropriate baselines and metrics, demonstrating the robustness and utility of the proposed methods.  
3. Practical Relevance: The ability to decode representations without additional training and the resilience to missing data make the approach highly practical for real-world applications like multi-label classification.  
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is dense with information, some sections, particularly the theoretical derivations, could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.  
2. Comparison with Non-Probabilistic Methods: While the paper focuses on probabilistic generative models, it would be helpful to include comparisons with non-probabilistic representation learning methods, such as standard autoencoders or variational autoencoders, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.  
3. Scalability Analysis: The paper could discuss the scalability of SPNs/MPNs in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements, especially for large-scale datasets.  
4. Interpretability of Representations: While the paper highlights the hierarchical and part-based nature of SPN features, further qualitative analysis or visualization of these representations across diverse datasets could strengthen the interpretability claims.  
Questions for the Authors  
1. How does the proposed decoding mechanism perform on continuous data, given that the experiments primarily focus on binary datasets?  
2. Could the authors elaborate on the potential limitations of SPNs/MPNs in terms of scalability or representation capacity for high-dimensional data?  
3. Have the authors considered integrating SPNs/MPNs with other deep learning architectures to leverage their complementary strengths?  
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of representation learning by extending the utility of SPNs and MPNs. The theoretical insights, coupled with robust empirical validation, make it a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the suggested improvements could further enhance the paper's impact and clarity.
