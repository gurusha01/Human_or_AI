The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method, Iterative PoWER, aimed at optimizing policies with a limited number of updates, a critical requirement in production environments such as online advertising and robotics. The authors build on the PoWER algorithm by introducing concave lower bounds to approximate the expected policy reward, enabling efficient optimization while reducing the need for frequent rollouts. A key contribution is the extension of existing EM-based methods to handle negative rewards, allowing the use of control variates to reduce variance. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Iterative PoWER through experiments on the Cartpole benchmark and real-world online advertising data, showing significant performance improvements over the original PoWER algorithm.
Decision: Accept
The paper addresses an important and practical problem in RL—policy optimization with limited updates—offering a well-motivated and theoretically sound solution. The method is rigorously analyzed and empirically validated, with results showing substantial improvements in both synthetic and real-world settings. The paper also contributes to the broader RL literature by extending EM-based methods to handle negative rewards, which has implications beyond the specific algorithm proposed.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Clear Problem Statement and Motivation: The paper identifies a critical gap in RL methods for production environments, where frequent policy updates are infeasible. The motivation is well-grounded in real-world constraints, such as the delay between policy deployments in online advertising and the wear-and-tear considerations in robotics.
2. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their approach, including proofs of concave lower bounds and extensions to handle negative rewards. The iterative framework is a natural and well-justified extension of PoWER.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of Iterative PoWER, particularly in the real-world advertising dataset where the method achieves a 60-fold improvement over PoWER. The use of control variates to reduce variance is a practical and impactful addition.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Variance Challenges: While the paper acknowledges the issue of high variance in later iterations, it does not provide a concrete solution beyond suggesting additional regularizers. Future work could explore practical regularization techniques or adaptive mechanisms to mitigate this issue.
2. Comparison with Baselines: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art RL methods, particularly those designed for off-policy learning or constrained optimization.
3. Clarity in Experiments: The experimental section, while thorough, could be more accessible with clearer visualizations and detailed explanations of parameter settings (e.g., the choice of control variate fractions).
4. Scalability Discussion: While the method is tested on large-scale advertising data, a discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of Iterative PoWER in even larger or more complex environments would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of Iterative PoWER compare to other off-policy RL methods, such as those based on Q-learning or actor-critic frameworks, in similar constrained settings?
2. Could the authors elaborate on the practical implications of using control variates in real-world systems? For example, how sensitive is the method to the choice of control variates?
3. What specific regularizers or techniques do the authors envision to address the high-variance issue in later iterations, and how might these impact the simplicity of the algorithm?
In summary, the paper makes a significant contribution to RL research by addressing a practical and underexplored problem with a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper warrant its acceptance.
