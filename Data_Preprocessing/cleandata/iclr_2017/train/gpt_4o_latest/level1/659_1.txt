Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions:  
This paper introduces a supervised sequence-to-sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism tailored for tasks with monotonic alignments, such as morphological inflection generation. The authors propose a novel approach that combines traditional statistical alignment methods with the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model enforces monotonic alignment through a hard attention mechanism, which simplifies the alignment process and reduces overfitting, particularly in low-resource settings. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, including CELEX, Wiktionary, and SIGMORPHON 2016, outperforming both neural and non-neural baselines. Additionally, the authors provide an insightful analysis of the learned alignments and representations, highlighting the advantages of their approach over soft attention models.
Decision: Accept  
The paper should be accepted because it addresses a well-defined problem in sequence-to-sequence transduction with a clear motivation for using hard attention in monotonic alignment tasks. The proposed model is novel, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates significant empirical improvements over existing methods, particularly in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the analysis of learned representations and alignments adds depth to the understanding of the model's behavior.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The authors provide a strong motivation for using hard attention in tasks with monotonic alignments, arguing that soft attention mechanisms may overfit or be suboptimal for such tasks. The proposed model is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in neural transduction and attention mechanisms while addressing their limitations.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse datasets and comparing the proposed model against multiple baselines. The results consistently show that the hard attention model achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-resource scenarios, where it surpasses both neural and non-neural baselines.  
3. Analysis and Insights: The paper goes beyond reporting results by analyzing the learned alignments and representations. This analysis demonstrates the model's ability to capture monotonic alignments effectively and sheds light on the differences between hard and soft attention mechanisms.  
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is thorough, some sections, particularly the model architecture and training procedure, are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations or diagrams. For example, the description of the control mechanism and the alignment process could be simplified for better readability.  
2. Generalization to Non-Monotonic Tasks: The paper focuses on monotonic alignment tasks, but it would be valuable to discuss the potential limitations of the hard attention mechanism in non-monotonic tasks or propose extensions for such cases.  
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper compares the hard attention model to baselines, it would be helpful to include ablation studies to isolate the contributions of specific components, such as the independently learned alignments or the bi-directional encoder.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How sensitive is the model's performance to the quality of the independently learned alignments? Would noisy alignments significantly degrade performance?  
2. Could the proposed hard attention mechanism be extended or adapted to tasks with non-monotonic alignments, such as machine translation?  
3. How does the computational efficiency of the hard attention model compare to soft attention models, particularly in large-scale datasets?  
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of sequence-to-sequence transduction by introducing a novel hard attention mechanism that is both effective and efficient for monotonic alignment tasks. The strong empirical results and insightful analysis justify its acceptance.
