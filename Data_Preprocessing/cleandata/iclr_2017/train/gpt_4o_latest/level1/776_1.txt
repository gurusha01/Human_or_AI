Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the limitations of existing machine translation (MT) decoding algorithms, which generate translations in a strictly monotonic fashion and cannot revisit earlier decisions. The authors propose an iterative refinement approach inspired by human translation processes, where an initial guess translation is iteratively improved through word substitutions. The model is parameterized as a convolutional neural network with attention mechanisms over both the source sentence and the current translation. The proposed method achieves up to a 0.4 BLEU improvement on WMT15 German-English translation while making fewer than one modification per sentence on average. The approach is novel in that it does not require post-edited text and can work with any initial guess translation, such as outputs from phrase-based or neural MT systems.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel approach to iterative refinement in MT, its solid placement in the literature, and its empirical validation of improvements in BLEU scores. The iterative decoding scheme is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates practical improvements over a strong baseline.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Problem Significance: The paper tackles a well-recognized limitation of current MT systemsâ€”the inability to revisit and correct earlier decoding errors. The iterative refinement approach is an innovative solution, drawing inspiration from human translation processes.
   
2. Methodological Rigor: The proposed models (single and dual attention) are well-designed, leveraging convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms. The dual attention model, in particular, demonstrates a thoughtful integration of both source and guess translations, reducing distributional shifts during training and testing.
3. Empirical Validation: The results are robust, showing consistent BLEU improvements across validation and test sets. The experiments are comprehensive, covering different refinement heuristics, oracle evaluations, and ablation studies to isolate model contributions.
4. Impact and Generalizability: The approach is general and can be applied to various initial guess translations, making it versatile for different MT systems. The low number of substitutions per sentence highlights its efficiency.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Error Analysis: While BLEU improvements are reported, the paper could benefit from a qualitative analysis of the types of errors corrected by the iterative refinement process. This would provide deeper insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
2. Comparison with Neural MT Outputs: The experiments focus on phrase-based MT outputs as the initial guess. Including results with neural MT outputs could strengthen the claim of generalizability and demonstrate the model's performance in more modern MT settings.
3. Confidence Estimation: The paper acknowledges that confidence estimation is a challenging task. Further exploration of more advanced confidence scoring methods could enhance the refinement process and potentially lead to greater BLEU improvements.
4. Computational Efficiency: While the paper mentions that the approach modifies fewer than one word per sentence on average, it would be helpful to include a discussion of the computational overhead introduced by the iterative process compared to traditional decoding methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform when starting with neural MT outputs as the initial guess? Are there any challenges in adapting the approach to such settings?
2. Could the iterative refinement process introduce fluency issues in cases where substitutions are made without sufficient context? If so, how might this be mitigated?
3. Did you observe any specific patterns in the types of errors corrected by the model (e.g., lexical choice, word order, grammatical errors)?
4. How does the model handle cases where the initial guess translation is of very poor quality? Does the refinement process still lead to meaningful improvements?
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of MT by introducing a novel iterative refinement framework. The approach is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and demonstrates practical improvements, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.
