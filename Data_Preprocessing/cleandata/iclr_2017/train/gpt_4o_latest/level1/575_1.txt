Review of the Paper: Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), a novel formulation of CCA that integrates seamlessly into multi-view neural networks as a differentiable layer. Unlike Deep CCA, which optimizes for maximally correlated projections as a final objective, this approach allows gradient flow through the computation of the CCA projection matrices. This enables direct optimization for task-specific objectives, such as cosine distance for cross-modality retrieval. The authors validate their method on two public datasets (Flickr30k and IAPR TC-12), demonstrating superior performance over Deep CCA and freely-learned projections in cross-modality retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the paper provides theoretical insights into the gradients of CCA and practical considerations for stochastic optimization, making it a potentially valuable building block for multi-modality tasks.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, rigorously evaluated, and addresses a meaningful gap in the literature. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Practical Value: The differentiable CCA formulation extends the applicability of CCA by enabling task-specific optimization, which is a significant improvement over existing methods like Deep CCA.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments on cross-modality retrieval tasks convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with clear performance gains over baselines.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-grounded in prior work, including classical CCA, Deep CCA, and related methods. The motivation to enable gradient flow through CCA and optimize for task-specific objectives is compelling and addresses a clear limitation of Deep CCA.
2. Methodological Rigor: The derivation of gradients for the CCA projection matrices is mathematically sound and well-explained. The authors also explore practical considerations like batch size and covariance matrix estimation, which enhance the robustness of their approach.
3. Experimental Results: The results on Flickr30k and IAPR TC-12 datasets are thorough, with multiple evaluation metrics (Recall@k, Median Rank, MAP) and ablation studies. The proposed method consistently outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically sound, certain sections (e.g., gradient derivations in Section 3.1) are dense and could benefit from additional visual aids or simplified explanations to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Broader Evaluation: The experiments focus on cross-modality retrieval, but the paper claims that Differentiable CCA could be a general-purpose building block for multi-modality tasks. Additional experiments on other tasks (e.g., multi-modal classification or representation learning) would strengthen this claim.
3. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper compares primarily with Deep CCA and freely-learned projections. Including results from other state-of-the-art methods for cross-modality retrieval (e.g., methods using attention mechanisms or transformers) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. Computational Efficiency: While the paper discusses the computational aspects of gradient derivations, it would be helpful to include a quantitative analysis of training time and memory requirements compared to Deep CCA.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of Differentiable CCA scale with increasing dimensionality of the projection space (e.g., k > 128)? Does it maintain its advantage over Deep CCA in high-dimensional settings?
2. Could the proposed method be extended to handle more than two modalities (e.g., image, text, and audio)? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of regularization parameters (e.g., the scaling factor r for covariance matrices)?
4. Have you considered integrating Differentiable CCA with modern architectures like transformers for multi-modal tasks? If so, how would this affect performance and computational cost?
In conclusion, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of multi-modality learning by introducing a novel and practical extension of CCA. With minor improvements in clarity and broader evaluation, it has the potential to become a foundational method for multi-view neural networks.
