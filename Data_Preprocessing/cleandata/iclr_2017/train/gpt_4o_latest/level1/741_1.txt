Review of the Paper
This paper investigates the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn game-related concepts under weak supervision using the simple game of tic-tac-toe as a case study. The authors explore three key questions: whether CNNs can understand game concepts, whether cross-modal supervision is applicable to higher-level semantics like game rules, and whether class activation mapping (CAM) can activate in non-salient regions. The paper claims that the CNN successfully learns game concepts such as the chessboard grid, winning rules, and player turns without explicit supervision. It further demonstrates that CAM can activate in texture-free regions, highlighting the CNN's ability to gather contextual information. The authors provide extensive experimental results and propose quantitative evaluation metrics to support their claims. The paper also emphasizes the robustness of its findings by testing variations in chessboard and piece appearances.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, addresses an important and underexplored problem, and provides compelling evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are: (1) the novelty of applying weak supervision to learn game concepts, which bridges reinforcement learning and representation learning; and (2) the rigorous experimental design, which includes multiple variations and quantitative evaluations to validate the results.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper tackles a unique problem—learning game concepts under weak supervision—which has not been explored in prior literature. The authors position their work well within the context of reinforcement learning, cross-modal supervision, and visualization techniques, making a strong case for the relevance of their study.
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough and systematically designed. The use of CAM to interpret the learned representations is insightful, and the quantitative metrics (representation accuracy and consistency) provide a robust evaluation of the results. The findings are consistent across different experimental settings, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.
3. Significance of Results: The results provide evidence that CNNs can learn higher-level game semantics, extending the applicability of cross-modal supervision to new domains. The demonstration of CAM activating in non-salient regions is particularly interesting and contributes to our understanding of CNN behavior.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify the Scope of Generalization: While the results are promising, it is unclear how well the proposed approach generalizes to more complex games or real-world scenarios. The authors could discuss potential limitations and future directions for scaling this method.
2. Comparison with Baselines: The paper would benefit from a comparison with alternative methods or baselines, such as traditional reinforcement learning approaches or other visualization techniques, to contextualize the performance of the proposed method.
3. Explain the Role of Weak Supervision: The paper could elaborate more on why weak supervision is critical in this context and how it compares to other forms of supervision in terms of efficiency and scalability.
4. Visualization Improvements: While the CAM results are informative, additional visualizations (e.g., intermediate feature maps or attention heatmaps) could provide deeper insights into how the network processes the input.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed approach scale to more complex games with larger state spaces or more intricate rules? Would the same methodology apply, or would modifications be required?
2. Could you provide more details on the computational cost of training the network and generating CAM visualizations? How feasible is this approach for real-time applications?
3. How sensitive is the method to variations in the dataset, such as noise in the input images or incomplete state representations?
4. Have you considered testing the approach on other simple games (e.g., Connect Four or Checkers) to further validate the generality of your findings?
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field and opens up exciting avenues for future research.
