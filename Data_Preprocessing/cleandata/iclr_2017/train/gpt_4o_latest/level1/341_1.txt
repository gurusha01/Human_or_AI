The paper addresses the problem of third-person imitation learning in reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent learns to perform tasks by observing demonstrations from a different viewpoint (third-person) without explicit state-action correspondences. The authors propose an unsupervised algorithm that leverages domain confusion and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to extract domain-agnostic features, enabling the agent to imitate expert behavior across different environments. They validate their approach through experiments in three simulated environments (pointmass, reacher, and inverted pendulum) and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to baselines.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons:
1. Novel Contribution: The paper tackles a significant and underexplored problem in RL—third-person imitation learning—by extending existing first-person imitation learning methods to a more practical and challenging setting. The use of domain confusion and multi-time step input is a creative and well-motivated solution.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, including comparisons with reasonable baselines and sensitivity analyses of hyperparameters.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, building on prior work in imitation learning, GANs, and domain adaptation. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of first-person imitation learning and justify the need for third-person approaches.
2. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is sound, with a clear formulation of the optimization problem and a detailed explanation of the algorithm. The experiments are thorough, addressing key questions such as sensitivity to hyperparameters, camera angle changes, and comparisons with baselines.
3. Impact Potential: The proposed method has practical implications for robotics and other domains where first-person demonstrations are difficult to obtain, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Problem Definition: While the paper provides a formal definition of third-person imitation learning, it would benefit from a more intuitive explanation or illustrative example early on to help readers unfamiliar with the concept.
2. Scalability and Generalization: The experiments are conducted in relatively simple environments. Future work should explore more complex and realistic tasks to assess the scalability of the approach.
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper evaluates the impact of domain confusion and multi-time step input, additional ablation studies on architectural choices (e.g., feature extractor design) could provide deeper insights into the method's performance.
4. Comparison with Additional Baselines: Including comparisons with other domain adaptation techniques or alternative feature extraction methods could strengthen the empirical evaluation.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method handle environments with significantly different dynamics (e.g., different physics engines or action spaces)?
2. Did you observe any failure cases where domain confusion led to the loss of task-relevant information? If so, how were these mitigated?
3. Could the approach be extended to handle multi-task or hierarchical imitation learning scenarios?
In summary, the paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to third-person imitation learning, with promising results and clear potential for future impact. While there are areas for improvement, the contribution is significant and warrants acceptance.
