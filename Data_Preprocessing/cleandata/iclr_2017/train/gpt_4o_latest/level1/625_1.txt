Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the critical challenge of zero-shot task generalization in reinforcement learning (RL), specifically in the context of executing sequences of high-level natural language instructions. The authors propose a novel hierarchical deep RL architecture comprising a meta controller and a subtask controller. The meta controller interprets instructions and communicates subtasks to the subtask controller, which executes them. To enhance generalization, the paper introduces two key innovations: (1) an analogy-making regularizer that learns subtask embeddings by capturing correspondences between similar subtasks, and (2) a differentiable neural architecture in the meta controller that learns temporal abstractions for stability under delayed rewards. The proposed architecture is evaluated in both a 2D grid world and a 3D visual environment, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen and longer instruction sequences. The results highlight the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure, analogy-making, and temporal abstractions in achieving zero-shot generalization.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of RL by addressing a challenging and underexplored problem of zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. The proposed hierarchical architecture is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and empirically validated. The results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the approach over baseline methods, particularly in generalizing to unseen instructions and longer sequences. The paper also provides detailed ablation studies and analyses, which strengthen the validity of its claims.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clear Problem Definition and Motivation: The paper identifies an important gap in RL research—generalization to unseen tasks and longer instruction sequences—and provides a well-justified motivation for tackling this problem. The hierarchical architecture is grounded in prior work on hierarchical RL and extends it meaningfully to address zero-shot generalization.
   
2. Innovative Approach: The introduction of analogy-making regularization and temporal abstractions is novel and well-executed. These techniques are shown to be critical for improving generalization, as evidenced by the ablation studies.
3. Strong Empirical Results: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both 2D and 3D environments. The hierarchical architecture consistently outperforms the flat controller baseline, particularly on unseen and longer instructions. The qualitative analysis of the agent's behavior further supports the claims.
4. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides detailed descriptions of the architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. The inclusion of curriculum learning and the comparison of hard vs. soft architectures demonstrate the authors' thoroughness in addressing potential challenges.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Presentation: The paper is dense and contains a significant amount of technical detail, which can be overwhelming. A clearer separation between the main contributions and supporting technical details (e.g., relegating more content to the appendix) would improve readability.
2. Broader Evaluation: While the proposed architecture performs well in the presented environments, it would be valuable to evaluate it on additional, more complex domains (e.g., real-world robotics or more diverse natural language instructions) to demonstrate broader applicability.
3. Comparison with More Baselines: The paper compares the hierarchical architecture primarily with a flat controller. Including comparisons with other state-of-the-art hierarchical RL methods or zero-shot learning approaches would strengthen the empirical results.
4. Explainability of Analogy-Making: While the analogy-making regularizer is effective, its interpretability could be improved. For example, visualizing the learned subtask embeddings or providing more intuitive examples of the analogies learned by the model would enhance understanding.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the architecture handle ambiguities or inconsistencies in natural language instructions? Could the approach be extended to handle more complex linguistic constructs (e.g., conditional or loop instructions)?
2. How sensitive is the performance to the hyperparameters of the analogy-making regularizer and temporal abstraction mechanisms? Are there guidelines for tuning these parameters in new environments?
3. Could the proposed architecture be trained in an end-to-end manner, rather than pre-training the subtask controller separately? If not, what are the main challenges preventing this?
Conclusion
This paper makes a strong contribution to RL research by addressing a critical challenge in zero-shot generalization. The proposed hierarchical architecture, combined with analogy-making and temporal abstractions, is novel, well-motivated, and empirically validated. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the paper outweigh its limitations, and it represents a valuable addition to the field. Recommendation: Accept.
