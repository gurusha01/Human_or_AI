Review of the Submitted Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper investigates the computational similarities between human visual perception and deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale image recognition tasks. It claims that perceptual sensitivity to image changes, segmentation, crowding, and shape interactions have correlates in DNN computations, with mid-computation layers aligning with perceptual saliency and end-computation layers aligning with higher-order perceptual phenomena. The authors provide empirical evidence for these claims using psychophysical experiments and DNN metrics, such as mutual information and L1 distance, across several architectures. The study contributes to the theoretical view that general-purpose visual learning may lead to architecture-independent convergence of computations. The findings have implications for brain modeling, psychophysics, and engineering applications like perceptual loss metrics.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and provides novel insights into the intersection of biological and artificial vision systems. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Significance: The paper explores a compelling hypothesis about the convergence of biological and artificial visual computations, supported by robust empirical evidence.
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, leveraging controlled psychophysical stimuli and multiple DNN architectures to ensure generalizability and reliability of results.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses an important and timely question in the field of AI and neuroscience: whether the computations of biological and artificial vision systems converge due to similar learning objectives. This is a well-posed and relevant problem, given the increasing use of DNNs in modeling biological vision.
2. Positioning in Literature: The paper is well-situated in the existing literature, building on prior work that links DNN representations to neural and perceptual data. It extends these findings by systematically quantifying computational similarities across multiple perceptual phenomena.
3. Empirical Support: The results are robust, showing strong correlations between DNN metrics and human perceptual data. The use of multiple architectures (e.g., AlexNet, ResNet, VGG) and baseline models strengthens the validity of the conclusions. The paper also identifies limitations, such as discrepancies in 3D perception and symmetry, which adds nuance to the findings.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong, the following points could enhance its clarity and impact:
1. Explainability of Results: The paper could provide more intuitive explanations for why specific DNN layers align with certain perceptual phenomena (e.g., why mid-computation layers correlate with saliency).
2. Broader Implications: The discussion could elaborate on how these findings might influence the design of future DNN architectures or inform theories of biological vision.
3. Architectural Variability: While multiple DNN architectures were tested, the paper could explore whether architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip connections) systematically affect the observed correlations.
4. Recurrent Processing: The paper briefly mentions the role of recurrence in biological vision but does not explore how recurrent DNNs might compare to feedforward models in capturing perceptual phenomena.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you account for the observed discrepancies in 3D perception and symmetry? Could these be addressed by fine-tuning DNNs on specific perceptual tasks?
2. Did you observe any significant differences in the results across the tested DNN architectures? If so, what might explain these differences?
3. How might the inclusion of recurrent or attention-based mechanisms in DNNs impact the alignment with biological perception?
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of computational parallels between biological and artificial vision systems. With minor clarifications and extensions, it has the potential to further advance the field.
