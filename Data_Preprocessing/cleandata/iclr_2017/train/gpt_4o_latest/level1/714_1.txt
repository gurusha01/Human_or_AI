Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised state representation learning for robotics by leveraging "robotic priors" within a Siamese network architecture. The authors propose a deep convolutional neural network trained to produce a low-dimensional representation of a robot's environment from raw images. By incorporating physically grounded priors—temporal coherence, proportionality, repeatability, and causality—the network learns task-relevant representations without supervision. The experimental results demonstrate a high correlation (97.7%) between the learned representation and the ground truth for a simulated Baxter robot's head position. The paper highlights the robustness of the proposed method to noise and luminosity variations, as well as its potential for transfer learning. This work builds on prior research on robotic priors and state representation learning, extending it with a deep learning-based architecture and demonstrating improved performance over simpler models.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its well-motivated approach, significant experimental results, and clear contributions to the field of unsupervised state representation learning. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The integration of robotic priors with a deep convolutional network and Siamese architecture is innovative and extends prior work in a meaningful way.
2. Experimental Rigor: The results convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness, robustness to noise, and potential for transfer learning, addressing both theoretical and practical concerns.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance: The paper addresses an important problem in robotics—learning task-relevant state representations from raw sensory data in an unsupervised manner. This is a critical step toward enabling robots to interact with complex environments without extensive manual supervision.
2. Well-Motivated Approach: The use of robotic priors is well-grounded in the literature, and the choice of a Siamese network architecture is justified by the need to impose constraints on learned representations. The paper effectively builds on prior work by Jonschkowski & Brock (2015) and extends it with a deep learning framework.
3. Experimental Validation: The experiments are thorough, with clear metrics (correlation with ground truth) and comparisons to a baseline one-layer network. The robustness to noise and the ability to learn transferable features further strengthen the claims.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Real-World Applicability: While the simulation results are promising, the paper would benefit from experiments on real-world data to validate the method's generalizability. The authors acknowledge this limitation but should provide a clearer roadmap for addressing it in future work.
2. Higher-Dimensional Representations: The paper focuses on a one-dimensional state representation. Extending the approach to higher-dimensional representations (e.g., 3D object positions) and evaluating their utility in reinforcement learning tasks would make the work more impactful.
3. Evaluation Metrics: The reliance on correlation with ground truth as the primary evaluation metric is a limitation, especially for tasks where ground truth is unavailable. Incorporating reinforcement learning-based evaluations, as suggested by the authors, would strengthen the results.
4. Clarity in Methodology: While the paper provides detailed equations for the priors, the explanation of how the priors interact during training could be made clearer, particularly for readers unfamiliar with Siamese networks.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method scale to more complex environments with higher-dimensional state representations? Have you considered applying it to tasks beyond head position control?
2. What challenges do you anticipate when transitioning from simulated to real-world data, and how do you plan to address them?
3. Could you elaborate on the trade-offs observed between minimizing different priors during training? How does this affect the learned representation's quality?
In conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to unsupervised state representation learning in robotics, and its acceptance would benefit the community. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its impact.
