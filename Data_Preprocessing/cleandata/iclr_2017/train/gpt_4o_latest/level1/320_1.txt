Review of the Paper
The paper addresses the problem of visual servoing in robotics, specifically focusing on target following. It proposes a novel approach that combines learned visual features, predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning to develop a visual servoing mechanism. The authors aim to create a system that can quickly adapt to new targets using minimal training data, leveraging pre-trained deep features (e.g., VGG features) and a bilinear predictive model. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in sample efficiency and robustness compared to conventional methods, including those based on image pixels, hand-designed keypoints, and standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, introduces a novel approach to visual servoing, and provides substantial empirical evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:  
1. Novelty and Contribution: The integration of pre-trained deep features, bilinear predictive models, and reinforcement learning for visual servoing is innovative and addresses the limitations of traditional methods, such as reliance on hand-designed features and extensive data requirements.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating the proposed method's robustness to occlusions, visual variations, and distractors. The sample efficiency improvement (over two orders of magnitude) compared to model-free reinforcement learning is particularly compelling.  
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance and Motivation: The paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing a longstanding challenge in robotics. By leveraging pre-trained features and bilinear dynamics, the authors effectively reduce the need for extensive task-specific engineering, which is a significant contribution to the field.  
2. Methodological Soundness: The use of fitted Q-iteration for learning feature weights is well-justified and computationally efficient. The authors provide a clear explanation of their approach, including the use of multiscale features and the bilinear dynamics model.  
3. Experimental Validation: The results on the synthetic car-following benchmark are compelling. The proposed method outperforms classical image-based visual servoing (IBVS), position-based visual servoing (PBVS), and end-to-end deep learning approaches in terms of both performance and computational efficiency. The generalization to novel targets further strengthens the case for the method's applicability.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity on Generalization: While the method generalizes well to novel cars in the synthetic benchmark, it would be helpful to discuss potential limitations in real-world scenarios. For instance, how would the method handle real-world noise, sensor inaccuracies, or more complex environments?  
2. Comparison with Real-World Data: The experiments are conducted in a simulated environment. Including results on real-world datasets or physical robots would significantly strengthen the paper's impact.  
3. Ablation Studies: While the paper compares different feature representations and weighting methods, additional ablation studies on the bilinear dynamics model (e.g., locally connected vs. fully connected) could provide deeper insights into its contribution.  
4. Computational Efficiency: The paper mentions that the method runs at 16Hz, with most computation time spent on feature extraction. Discussing potential optimizations (e.g., using lightweight networks) would be valuable for real-time applications.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method perform in real-world scenarios with noisy or incomplete observations? Have you considered testing the approach on physical robots?  
2. Could the proposed method be extended to tasks beyond target following, such as object manipulation or multi-agent coordination?  
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of pre-trained features (e.g., VGG vs. other architectures)?  
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of visual servoing and robotics. Addressing the above suggestions could further enhance its impact and applicability.
