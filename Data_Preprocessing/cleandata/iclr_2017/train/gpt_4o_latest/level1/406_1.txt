Review of the Paper: "EPOpt Algorithm for Robust Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces the Ensemble Policy Optimization (EPOpt) algorithm, which addresses the challenges of sample complexity and safety in reinforcement learning (RL) for real-world tasks. The authors propose a novel approach that trains policies on an ensemble of simulated source domains using adversarial training, aiming to improve robustness and generalization to target domains, including those with unmodeled effects. Additionally, the paper incorporates a Bayesian model adaptation step to iteratively refine the source domain distribution using limited data from the target domain. The method is evaluated on challenging MuJoCo benchmarks (hopper and half-cheetah), demonstrating improved robustness and transferability compared to standard policy search methods. The paper also provides theoretical insights into the CVaR-based optimization objective and presents extensive empirical results to validate the claims.
Decision: Accept
Key reasons for acceptance:
1. Novelty and Practical Relevance: The proposed EPOpt algorithm effectively combines ensemble training, adversarial optimization, and Bayesian adaptation to address critical challenges in RL, such as robustness to model discrepancies and efficient domain adaptation.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that EPOpt outperforms baseline methods in robustness, generalization, and sample efficiency, particularly in scenarios with unmodeled effects or significant domain discrepancies.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, bridging gaps between robust control, Bayesian RL, and transfer learning. The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing methods (e.g., high sample complexity of model-free RL and brittleness of policies trained on single models) and position EPOpt as a principled solution.
2. Scientific Rigor: The CVaR-based adversarial training formulation is theoretically sound and aligns with robust control principles. The experiments are thorough, covering diverse scenarios such as robustness to unmodeled effects, adaptation to target domains, and comparisons with standard policy search methods.
3. Practical Impact: The ability to train robust policies with limited target domain data has significant implications for real-world applications, such as robotics, where safety and sample efficiency are paramount.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Computational Complexity: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EPOpt, it would benefit from a more detailed analysis of computational costs, particularly for the Bayesian adaptation step. How does the method scale with the number of parameters in the source domain distribution?
2. Broader Benchmarks: The experiments focus on MuJoCo tasks, which, while challenging, are limited in scope. Evaluating EPOpt on additional domains, such as real-world robotics or vision-based tasks, would strengthen the paper's claims of generalizability.
3. Ablation Studies: Although the paper includes some analysis of the impact of the CVaR parameter (Îµ), further ablation studies on the importance of adversarial training, ensemble size, and Bayesian adaptation would provide deeper insights into the algorithm's performance.
4. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is dense, and some sections (e.g., the derivation of the CVaR objective and the Bayesian update) could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of EPOpt to the choice of the initial source domain distribution? In cases where prior knowledge is limited, how can practitioners ensure that the initial distribution is broad enough to capture the target domain?
2. Can the Bayesian adaptation step handle dynamic target domains where the parameters evolve over time (e.g., due to wear and tear in physical systems)? If so, how does this affect the convergence of the algorithm?
3. What are the limitations of EPOpt in terms of scalability to high-dimensional state and action spaces, or tasks with sparse rewards? Are there any plans to extend the method to handle these challenges?
Conclusion
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of RL by addressing robustness and generalization in a principled and practical manner. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and strong empirical results make this work a valuable addition to the conference. I recommend acceptance.
