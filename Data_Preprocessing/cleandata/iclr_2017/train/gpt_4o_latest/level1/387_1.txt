The paper proposes a novel modification to the texture synthesis approach introduced by Gatys et al. (2015a), enabling the incorporation of long-range spatial structure into image generation. By introducing transformed Gram matrices that capture spatial co-occurrences of features, the authors address the limitations of existing methods in generating regular textures and preserving global symmetry. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through applications in structured texture generation, inpainting, and season transfer, showing improvements over prior methods in capturing long-range correlations and symmetry constraints.
Decision: Accept.  
The key reasons for this decision are: (1) The paper addresses a well-defined and significant problem in texture synthesis—capturing long-range spatial structure—which has been a limitation in prior work. (2) The proposed method is both conceptually simple and well-motivated, leveraging insights from prior literature while extending them in a meaningful way. The results convincingly demonstrate the utility of the approach across multiple applications, supported by rigorous experiments and visual evidence.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Problem Significance and Contribution: The paper identifies a clear gap in existing texture synthesis methods and provides a compelling solution. The introduction of spatially transformed Gram matrices is a natural extension of the original method by Gatys et al., and the results effectively showcase the value of this innovation.  
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering a range of textures and tasks (e.g., inpainting, season transfer). The visual results are compelling, particularly in demonstrating the method's ability to handle structured textures and symmetry. The comparisons with Gatys et al. are fair and highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.  
3. Broader Impact: The method's applicability to multiple tasks (e.g., inpainting, style transfer) suggests its potential for broader use in image synthesis and editing applications.  
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Computational Efficiency: The paper notes that the inclusion of cross-correlation terms increases generation time by approximately 80%. While this is acknowledged, further discussion on potential optimizations or trade-offs would strengthen the paper.  
2. Parameter Selection: The choice of δ values for spatial translations is described as challenging and texture-dependent. Providing a more systematic approach or guidelines for selecting these parameters could improve reproducibility and usability.  
3. Broader Comparisons: While the paper compares its method to Gatys et al., additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods (e.g., patch-based techniques) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How sensitive is the method to the choice of δ values? Could an adaptive or data-driven approach be used to select these values automatically?  
2. Have you explored the scalability of the method to larger image sizes or more complex textures?  
3. Could the proposed approach be extended to handle other types of global structure, such as perspective or depth cues?  
Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of texture synthesis and image generation. While there are areas for further refinement, the novelty, rigor, and demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed approach justify its acceptance.
