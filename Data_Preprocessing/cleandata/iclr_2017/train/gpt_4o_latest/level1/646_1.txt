The paper introduces a novel Context-aware Attention Network (CAN) for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), which combines a two-level attention mechanism (word-level and sentence-level) with an interactive mechanism to handle incomplete information in QA tasks. The model leverages Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) as encoders and decoders, and introduces a context-aware attention mechanism to improve semantic representation. A key contribution is the model's ability to determine when it can answer a question directly and when additional user input is needed, making it self-adaptive. The authors also propose a new dataset, ibAbI, to evaluate IQA tasks and demonstrate that CAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QA models on both traditional and interactive datasets.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, addresses a relevant and challenging problem in QA, and presents a clear advancement over existing methods. The proposed model is novel, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates strong empirical results, particularly in handling incomplete information through interaction. These contributions make it a valuable addition to the field of QA.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper identifies key limitations in existing QA models, such as their inability to handle context-dependent word meanings and incomplete information. The introduction of a two-level attention mechanism and an interactive component is a novel and well-motivated solution to these challenges.
2. Empirical Results: The experimental results are robust and demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models (e.g., DMN+, MemN2N) on both traditional QA and IQA tasks. The 40% improvement on IQA datasets is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the model's ability to handle ambiguous or incomplete scenarios effectively.
3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics. The experiments are well-designed, and the qualitative analysis of attention weights further validates the model's interpretability and effectiveness.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Interactive Mechanism: While the interactive mechanism is a key contribution, its implementation could be explained more intuitively. For instance, examples of how the model generates supplementary questions and incorporates user feedback could be expanded for better understanding.
2. Comparison with More Baselines: Although the paper compares CAN with strong baselines like DMN+ and MemN2N, additional comparisons with recent transformer-based QA models could strengthen the evaluation.
3. Generalization to Other Domains: The paper focuses on textual QA datasets (bAbI and ibAbI). It would be valuable to discuss how the model could generalize to other domains, such as visual QA or multi-modal QA tasks.
4. Ablation Studies: While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the two-level attention mechanism and interactive component, ablation studies isolating their contributions would provide deeper insights into their individual impact.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the model handle scenarios where user feedback is ambiguous or contradictory? Are there mechanisms to validate or refine user input?
2. Could the proposed ibAbI dataset be extended to include more complex reasoning tasks or multi-turn dialogues? If so, what challenges might arise?
3. How does the model's performance scale with larger datasets or more complex QA tasks, such as those involving multiple entities or temporal reasoning?
In conclusion, the paper presents a well-executed and impactful contribution to the field of QA, addressing a critical gap in handling incomplete information through interaction. With minor clarifications and additional comparisons, this work has the potential to set a new benchmark for IQA research.
