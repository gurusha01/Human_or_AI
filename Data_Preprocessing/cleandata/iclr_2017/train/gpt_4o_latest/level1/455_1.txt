Review of "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks (EBGAN)"
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces the Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (EBGAN), which reinterprets the discriminator in GANs as an energy function rather than a probabilistic classifier. This novel perspective allows for greater flexibility in discriminator architecture and loss functions. A key instantiation of this framework uses an auto-encoder as the discriminator, where the reconstruction error serves as the energy function. The authors claim that this approach improves training stability compared to traditional GANs and demonstrate its ability to generate high-resolution images without requiring multi-scale architectures. The paper also provides theoretical guarantees, including a proof that the generator converges to the data distribution under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, LSUN, CelebA, and ImageNet datasets showcase the model's performance, including its application to semi-supervised learning. The introduction of a "repelling regularizer" further enhances sample diversity.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted for its novel reinterpretation of GANs, theoretical rigor, and comprehensive experimental validation. The energy-based perspective is a significant conceptual contribution that bridges GANs and energy-based models, opening new avenues for research. The demonstrated stability improvements and scalability to high-resolution image generation are compelling practical contributions.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The energy-based reinterpretation of GANs is well-motivated and fills a gap in the literature by unifying two prominent unsupervised learning paradigms: GANs and energy-based models. The use of auto-encoders as discriminators is conceptually appealing and experimentally validated.
   
2. Theoretical Rigor: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, including proofs of convergence and optimality under the proposed framework. This adds credibility to the claims and distinguishes the work from purely empirical studies.
3. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets and tasks, including high-resolution image generation and semi-supervised learning. The results consistently demonstrate the advantages of EBGANs over traditional GANs in terms of training stability and sample quality.
4. Practical Contributions: The introduction of the repelling regularizer and the margin-decay strategy are practical innovations that address common issues in GAN training, such as mode collapse and instability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity on Theoretical Assumptions: While the theoretical analysis is robust, the assumptions (e.g., infinite capacity of the generator and discriminator) may not hold in practical settings. The authors could discuss how these assumptions affect real-world applicability.
2. Comparison with Other Stabilization Techniques: The paper could include a more detailed comparison with other GAN stabilization methods, such as Wasserstein GANs or spectral normalization, to better contextualize the improvements.
3. Ablation Studies: While the experiments are comprehensive, ablation studies isolating the impact of the auto-encoder architecture, margin-decay strategy, and repelling regularizer would strengthen the claims.
4. Evaluation Metrics: The paper primarily uses inception scores and qualitative visualizations. Incorporating additional metrics, such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), would provide a more robust evaluation of sample quality.
5. Scalability to Larger Datasets: While the results on ImageNet are promising, the paper could discuss the computational challenges and scalability of EBGANs when applied to even larger datasets or more complex tasks.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the model to the choice of the margin parameter \(m\)? Could you provide more guidance on how to set or tune this parameter in practice?
2. The paper claims that EBGANs exhibit more stable training than traditional GANs. Could you provide quantitative evidence, such as convergence rates or loss curves, to support this claim?
3. Have you explored using other architectures for the discriminator beyond auto-encoders? If so, how do they compare in terms of performance and stability?
4. How does the computational cost of EBGANs compare to traditional GANs, especially for high-resolution image generation?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of generative modeling by introducing a novel energy-based perspective on GANs. With minor improvements in clarity and additional comparisons, this work has the potential to become a foundational reference in the field.
