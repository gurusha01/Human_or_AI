Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach for pruning convolutional kernels in neural networks to enhance inference efficiency, particularly in transfer learning scenarios. The authors propose a Taylor expansion-based criterion for pruning, which approximates the change in the cost function when parameters are removed. The method interleaves greedy pruning with fine-tuning, maintaining generalization while being computationally efficient. The paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed criterion over existing methods, such as weight norm or activation-based pruning, across multiple tasks, including fine-grained classification (Birds-200 and Flowers-102), gesture recognition, and large-scale ImageNet classification. Notably, the method achieves significant reductions in FLOPs (up to 12.6×) with minimal accuracy loss. The authors also provide a thorough comparison with other pruning techniques, such as Optimal Brain Damage (OBD), and validate their claims with rigorous empirical evaluations.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presents a clear and novel contribution, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Practicality: The Taylor expansion-based pruning criterion is both innovative and computationally efficient, addressing a critical bottleneck in deploying deep networks on resource-constrained devices.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: The method is rigorously tested across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating its generalizability and effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Motivation and Literature Placement: The paper clearly identifies the inefficiency of large pretrained networks in transfer learning tasks and positions its contribution well within the existing pruning literature. The comparison with OBD and other criteria is thorough and highlights the advantages of the proposed method.
2. Scientific Rigor: The use of Spearman's rank correlation to compare pruning criteria with an oracle is a thoughtful and scientifically rigorous approach. The experiments are detailed, and the results consistently show the superiority of the Taylor criterion.
3. Practical Impact: The demonstrated FLOPs reduction and real-world speedups on hardware make the method highly practical for deployment, a critical aspect for industry applications.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Computational Overhead: While the paper emphasizes the computational efficiency of the Taylor criterion, a more detailed comparison of runtime overheads (e.g., pruning time vs. fine-tuning time) across methods would strengthen the claims.
2. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses primarily on convolutional layers. It would be helpful to discuss the applicability of the method to other architectures, such as transformers or fully connected layers.
3. Impact of Hyperparameters: The choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of fine-tuning iterations between pruning steps, appears to influence results significantly. A sensitivity analysis or guidelines for selecting these parameters would enhance reproducibility.
4. Combination of Criteria: The paper briefly explores combining the Taylor criterion with activation-based criteria but finds negligible gains. Further exploration of hybrid approaches or adaptive weighting schemes might yield insights.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform when pruning networks trained on tasks other than vision, such as NLP or reinforcement learning?
2. The paper mentions that the Taylor criterion relies on first-order gradient information. Could this approach be extended to leverage second-order information for potentially better performance, or would this negate its computational efficiency?
3. Could the authors provide more details on the FLOPs regularization parameter (λ) and its impact on pruning outcomes?
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of model compression and pruning, with a well-motivated approach and strong empirical validation. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its impact and clarity.
