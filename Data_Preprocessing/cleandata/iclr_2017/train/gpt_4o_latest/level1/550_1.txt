Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a modification to the objective function of Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs) to explicitly enforce denoising during the encoding phase, addressing a key limitation of the original DAE objective. The authors introduce an additional term in the objective function that minimizes the distance between the encodings of corrupted and uncorrupted inputs, thereby promoting robustness in the encoding phase. The paper provides theoretical justification for the modified objective, including its relationship to mutual information and conditional entropy. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, particularly in over-complete scenarios where the original DAE objective may fail to regularize the encoding space adequately. The work is well-motivated, and the proposed modification is simple yet impactful, with potential implications for improving unsupervised representation learning.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution by addressing a known limitation of DAEs with a theoretically sound and empirically validated solution. The simplicity of the proposed modification and its demonstrated effectiveness make it a valuable addition to the literature on auto-encoders and unsupervised learning. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Impact: The proposed modification is both novel and practical, with the potential to enhance the robustness of DAEs in various applications.
2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical analysis is thorough, and the empirical results convincingly support the claims made in the paper.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Problem: The paper identifies a clear limitation in the original DAE objective, specifically the lack of explicit robustness in the encoding phase. The proposed solution is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work on DAEs, contractive auto-encoders, and sparsity-based methods.
2. Theoretical Soundness: The authors provide a strong theoretical foundation for the modified objective, linking it to mutual information and conditional entropy. The analysis is rigorous and offers valuable insights into the behavior of the modified DAE.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on synthetic datasets and MNIST are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results clearly show that the modified DAE achieves better regularization and robustness in the encoding phase compared to the original DAE.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Presentation: While the theoretical analysis is thorough, some sections (e.g., the derivation of the upper bound on conditional entropy) are dense and could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Broader Evaluation: The experiments focus primarily on synthetic datasets and MNIST. Including results on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) would strengthen the empirical validation and demonstrate the scalability of the approach.
3. Ablation Studies: The paper briefly mentions the impact of the trade-off parameter λ but does not provide a detailed analysis of its influence on performance. A more comprehensive ablation study would help clarify the role of this parameter and guide its selection in practice.
4. Comparison with Other Methods: While the paper discusses related work, the experimental section could include a direct comparison with other robustness-promoting methods, such as contractive auto-encoders or adversarial training.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of the modified DAE to the choice of the trade-off parameter λ? Could you provide guidance on how to select this parameter in practice?
2. Have you considered extending the proposed approach to stacked or deep DAEs? If so, how does the modified objective scale with depth?
3. Could the proposed method be adapted for use in other types of auto-encoders, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs) or adversarial auto-encoders?
In conclusion, the paper addresses an important limitation of DAEs with a simple yet effective modification to the objective function. While there are areas for improvement, the contributions are significant, and the work is likely to have a meaningful impact on the field.
