Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning approach to learn tree-structured neural networks for sentence representation, optimizing tree structures for downstream tasks rather than relying on predefined syntactic trees. The authors argue that task-specific tree structures can outperform both sequential and linguistically motivated recursive models. The paper demonstrates this claim through experiments on four tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, natural language inference, and sentence generation. Results show that the learned latent tree structures outperform fixed tree structures and sequential models across all tasks. Additionally, the paper provides an insightful analysis of the induced trees, highlighting their partial alignment with linguistic intuitions while also showcasing task-specific deviations. The work bridges the gap between unsupervised grammar induction and task-specific representation learning, offering a simpler alternative to traditional grammar induction methods.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field by introducing a reinforcement learning framework for discovering task-specific tree structures, which is both novel and impactful. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over baselines, and the qualitative analysis of the learned trees provides valuable insights into the model's behavior. The work is well-motivated, methodologically sound, and addresses an important problem in natural language processing.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses a critical gap in the literature by moving beyond predefined syntactic structures to task-specific tree learning. The use of reinforcement learning for this purpose is innovative and well-justified.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple tasks and baselines. The results consistently show that the proposed latent syntax model outperforms both sequential and supervised tree-based models.
3. Analysis of Induced Trees: The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the learned tree structures is a strength of the paper. It demonstrates that the model can discover linguistically meaningful structures while optimizing for task performance.
4. Impact: The proposed approach has the potential to influence future work in both unsupervised grammar induction and task-specific representation learning, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Training Efficiency: A major limitation of the approach is its high computational cost, with training times significantly longer than models with predefined structures. The authors should explore techniques to reduce training time, such as batch processing or more efficient policy gradient methods.
2. Comparison with Stronger Baselines: While the paper compares against a range of baselines, it would be helpful to include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art models, particularly those using transformer architectures.
3. Explainability of Learned Trees: While the analysis of induced trees is insightful, the paper could benefit from a more systematic evaluation of how these structures align with linguistic theories or human intuitions.
4. Scalability: The experiments are limited to 100-dimensional embeddings due to computational constraints. It would be useful to discuss how the approach might scale to larger models and datasets.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the model to the choice of reward function in reinforcement learning? Would alternative reward functions (e.g., incorporating linguistic priors) improve performance or interpretability?
2. Did the authors experiment with larger embedding dimensions or more complex downstream tasks? If so, how did the model perform?
3. Can the learned tree structures be transferred across tasks, or are they strictly task-specific? This could provide insights into the generalizability of the approach.
In conclusion, the paper is a strong contribution to the field and should be accepted, with minor revisions to address computational efficiency and scalability.
