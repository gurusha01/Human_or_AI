Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions:  
This paper addresses the black-box nature of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by proposing a framework to analyze individual neurons based on their selectivity to specific properties. The authors introduce two selectivity indexes: (1) a color selectivity index that quantifies a neuron's response to specific colors, and (2) a class selectivity index that measures a neuron's discriminative power for specific class labels. The paper also introduces the concept of a "Neuron Feature" (NF), which visualizes the intrinsic properties of neurons by averaging the images that maximally activate them. The authors demonstrate the utility of these indexes on the VGG-M network trained on ImageNet, revealing insights into how color and class information is represented across layers. The work contributes to understanding CNN behavior and offers a methodology for analyzing neuron activity in a structured and interpretable manner.
Decision: Accept  
Key reasons:  
1. The paper provides a novel and well-motivated framework for analyzing CNNs, addressing a critical gap in interpretability research.  
2. The results are scientifically rigorous, with thorough experiments demonstrating the utility of the proposed selectivity indexes and their relevance to both low-level (color) and high-level (class) properties.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Problem Relevance and Motivation: The paper tackles the important problem of understanding CNNs, a topic of growing interest in the AI community. The motivation is clear, and the work is well-situated within the literature, building on prior visualization and interpretability methods while addressing their limitations.  
2. Methodological Rigor: The proposed selectivity indexes are grounded in established concepts (e.g., principal component analysis for color selectivity) and are applied systematically across layers of the CNN. The experiments are comprehensive, covering both theoretical insights (e.g., distributed vs. localist coding) and practical observations (e.g., the role of color in classification).  
3. Empirical Results: The results are compelling, showing that color selectivity decreases with depth while class selectivity increases. The findings are supported by visualizations and quantitative analyses, which enhance the interpretability of the results.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is rich in content, it is dense and could benefit from clearer organization. For example, the introduction could better highlight the novelty of the proposed framework compared to prior works. Additionally, the figures and visualizations, while informative, could be better annotated to aid understanding.  
2. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on VGG-M, but it would be valuable to include results or discussions on how the framework generalizes to other architectures, such as ResNets or transformers.  
3. Additional Selectivity Indexes: The authors mention the potential for indexes based on shape or texture. Including preliminary results or examples of these would strengthen the paper's contribution and demonstrate the extensibility of the framework.  
4. Biological Insights: The paper draws parallels between CNN representations and the human visual system. Expanding on these parallels with more concrete biological evidence or references would enhance the interdisciplinary relevance of the work.
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How sensitive are the proposed selectivity indexes to the choice of dataset or CNN architecture? For example, would the same trends (e.g., color selectivity decreasing with depth) hold for networks trained on datasets with different properties (e.g., grayscale images)?  
2. Can the framework be extended to unsupervised or self-supervised learning models, where class labels are not available?  
3. How do the proposed indexes compare to existing neuron interpretability methods in terms of computational efficiency and interpretability?  
Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of CNN interpretability and provides a solid foundation for future work in this area. With minor improvements in clarity and scope, it could have even broader impact.
