Review of the Paper: Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN)
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces the Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN), a novel neural network architecture designed to learn hierarchical representations of social network graphs. SAEN employs a unique H-hierarchical decomposition to represent graphs as multi-level structures, with vector representations computed through shift, aggregate, and extract operations. The paper also proposes a domain compression algorithm that exploits symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to significantly reduce memory usage and computational runtime. Empirical evaluations on six real-world social network datasets demonstrate that SAEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks, while the domain compression algorithm achieves substantial speedups and enables scalability to large datasets.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel contributions to graph representation learning, rigorous experimental validation, and practical utility in handling large-scale social network data. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Impact: The introduction of the H-hierarchical decomposition and the domain compression algorithm addresses critical challenges in graph learning, such as scalability and irregular graph structures.
2. Empirical Rigor: The method demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, with clear evidence of its computational efficiency and effectiveness.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, providing a thorough comparison with existing graph kernels and neural network-based methods. It highlights the limitations of prior approaches, such as handcrafted features and global weight sharing, and positions SAEN as a flexible and scalable alternative.
2. Scientific Rigor: The proposed architecture and domain compression algorithm are described in detail, with clear mathematical formulations and algorithmic steps. The experimental results are robust, including 10-times 10-fold cross-validation and comparisons with strong baselines. The significant runtime improvements and memory savings further validate the practical utility of the method.
3. Broad Applicability: While SAEN is tailored for social networks, its ability to handle other types of graphs (e.g., molecular and protein datasets) demonstrates its generalizability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Mathematical Notation: While the mathematical formulations are comprehensive, some notations (e.g., the use of Kronecker products and compression matrices) could benefit from additional intuitive explanations or visual aids to enhance accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Ablation Studies: The paper could include ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components, such as the shift, aggregate, and extract operations, as well as the domain compression algorithm.
3. Scalability Analysis: While the paper reports speedups and memory savings, a more detailed analysis of the scalability of SAEN with respect to graph size and complexity would strengthen the claims.
4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The manual selection of parameters (e.g., number of layers, hidden units, and radii) is noted, but a discussion on hyperparameter sensitivity or automated tuning methods would be valuable.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of SAEN vary with different choices of H-hierarchical decompositions? Are there specific heuristics for selecting the decomposition strategy?
2. Could the domain compression algorithm introduce any trade-offs in terms of representational fidelity or accuracy, especially for highly irregular graphs?
3. How does SAEN handle dynamic or evolving social networks where graph structures change over time?
In conclusion, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field of graph representation learning, addressing key challenges in scalability and irregularity of social network data. With minor refinements, it has the potential to set a new benchmark for graph-based learning methods.
