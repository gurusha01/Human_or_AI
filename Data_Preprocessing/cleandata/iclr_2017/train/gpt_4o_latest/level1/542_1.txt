Review of the Paper: "A Framework for Multitask Deep Reinforcement Learning Guided by Policy Sketches"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages policy sketchesâ€”high-level task annotations specifying sequences of subtasks. Unlike prior work, this approach does not rely on intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations. The framework associates each subtask with a modular subpolicy, enabling parameter sharing across tasks and optimizing task-specific policies through a decoupled actor-critic training objective. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in two challenging environments: a maze navigation game and a crafting game, both featuring sparse rewards and hierarchical task structures. Key contributions include:
1. A modular policy architecture that learns reusable subpolicies from task sketches.
2. A curriculum learning strategy that accelerates training by progressively increasing task complexity.
3. Empirical results showing superior performance over baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, reward maximization, and generalization to unseen tasks.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multitask RL by proposing a well-motivated and innovative approach that addresses the challenge of sparse rewards and task generalization. The modular design and use of policy sketches are novel and effective, as evidenced by the strong experimental results. The method's ability to induce reusable subpolicies and support zero-shot generalization is particularly compelling. However, some clarifications and additional experiments would further strengthen the paper.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Motivation and Literature Placement: The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing hierarchical RL methods, such as reliance on dense rewards or predefined subtask signals. The proposed approach is well-situated within the literature, building on the options framework and modular policy architectures while addressing their shortcomings. The discussion of related work is thorough and highlights the novelty of the proposed method.
   
2. Scientific Rigor and Results: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in two distinct environments. The modular method outperforms baselines in both reward maximization and convergence speed. Ablation studies convincingly show the importance of key components, such as the decoupled critic and curriculum learning. The generalization experiments further validate the method's ability to adapt to unseen tasks, a critical capability for multitask RL.
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the model, training procedure, and experimental setup. The inclusion of algorithms and detailed task descriptions enhances reproducibility. The release of code is a valuable contribution to the community.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Comparison with Additional Baselines: While the baselines used are reasonable, the inclusion of more recent hierarchical RL methods (e.g., those leveraging intrinsic motivation or unsupervised skill discovery) would provide a stronger benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach.
   
2. Scalability Analysis: It would be helpful to discuss the scalability of the method to larger task sets or more complex environments. For example, how does the number of subpolicies or the size of the task vocabulary affect performance?
3. Interpretability of Subpolicies: The paper claims that the learned subpolicies are interpretable, but this is not explicitly demonstrated. Including qualitative examples or visualizations of subpolicy behaviors would strengthen this claim.
4. Zero-Shot Generalization: While the zero-shot results are promising, it would be interesting to explore how the method performs when sketches for new tasks are noisy or incomplete. This would better reflect real-world scenarios where task annotations may be imperfect.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the method to the quality of the provided sketches? For example, what happens if the sketches are suboptimal or contain errors?
2. Can the modular subpolicies learned in one domain (e.g., maze navigation) be transferred to a completely different domain (e.g., crafting)?
3. How does the method handle tasks with overlapping but slightly different subtasks? Does it effectively reuse subpolicies in such cases?
In conclusion, this paper presents a well-motivated and innovative approach to multitask RL that addresses key challenges in the field. The modular architecture, combined with policy sketches and curriculum learning, offers a promising direction for future research. With minor clarifications and additional experiments, this work has the potential to make a significant impact on the community.
