The paper investigates the robustness and structure of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) representations by empirically measuring their invariance and equivariance properties under various input transformations. It evaluates 70 CNNs trained with different data augmentation strategies across two datasets, quantifying their ability to generalize to unseen transformations. The authors also propose a novel loss function to improve CNN equivariance, balancing classification accuracy on transformed and untransformed inputs. Their findings demonstrate that CNNs learn invariance to all tested transformations, even beyond the training range, and that similar transformations yield more similar internal representations. Additionally, the proposed loss function enhances equivariance while maintaining classification performance.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to understanding the internal representations of CNNs, a topic of growing interest in the AI community. Its large-scale empirical study, novel loss function, and insights into the effects of data augmentation on representation robustness are well-motivated and scientifically rigorous. However, there are areas for improvement in clarity and experimental depth, which could further strengthen the paper.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The study addresses a critical gap in understanding CNN representations, building on prior work but extending it significantly by considering a broader range of transformations and datasets. The inclusion of both invariance and equivariance metrics provides a comprehensive analysis.
2. Rigorous Results: The experiments are methodologically sound, with clear definitions of invariance and equivariance and appropriate metrics for evaluation. The findings are consistent and provide actionable insights, such as the trade-offs introduced by the proposed loss function.
3. Novel Contribution: The proposed loss function for improving equivariance is a valuable addition, demonstrating practical utility in enhancing CNN robustness.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Clarity in Presentation: While the paper is thorough, the dense mathematical formulations and extensive experimental details can overwhelm readers. A more concise presentation of key equations and results, perhaps relegating some to an appendix, would improve readability.
2. Broader Context: The paper could better contextualize its findings by discussing potential applications of improved equivariance (e.g., in real-world scenarios like autonomous driving or medical imaging).
3. Ablation Studies: While the proposed loss function is promising, an ablation study exploring the impact of its individual components (e.g., λ1, λ2, λ3) would provide deeper insights into its effectiveness.
4. Cross-Dataset Generalization: The cross-dataset evaluation is a valuable addition, but the analysis could be expanded to include more diverse datasets or tasks to validate the generalizability of the findings.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive are the results to the choice of the datasets? Would the findings generalize to tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or segmentation?
2. Could the proposed loss function be adapted for other architectures, such as Vision Transformers? If so, what challenges might arise?
3. How do the findings on representation similarity align with practical implications for transfer learning or model ensembling?
In conclusion, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for improving CNN robustness. With minor revisions to enhance clarity and depth, it will be a strong addition to the conference.
