The paper addresses the critical problem of adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs), which exploit vulnerabilities in DNNs by introducing imperceptible perturbations to input data, leading to misclassification. The authors aim to empirically evaluate and compare the robustness of various defensive strategies, including adversarial retraining (RAD), AutoEncoder stacked with Classifier (AEC), an improved version (IAEC), and Distillation, against adversarial attacks. They also analyze cross-model generalization, resilience to repeated attacks, and vulnerabilities introduced by these defenses. The paper claims that RAD outperforms other methods in robustness, cross-model generalization, and resilience without introducing additional vulnerabilities or performance penalties.
Decision: Accept
The key reasons for acceptance are:  
1. Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper provides a thorough empirical analysis of multiple defensive strategies against diverse adversarial models, including both one-step and iterative attacks.  
2. Novel Contributions: The authors propose an improved defensive strategy (IAEC) and demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization ability of RAD, making significant contributions to the field of adversarial robustness.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. The paper is well-motivated and situated in the literature, addressing a pressing issue in DNN security. It builds on and extends prior work by comparing multiple adversarial models and defenses in a systematic manner.  
2. The experimental results are robust and scientifically rigorous. The authors evaluate defenses on two datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) and provide detailed comparisons of classification error, cross-model generalization, and resilience to repeated attacks. The findings consistently support the claims that RAD is the most robust and generalizable defense.  
3. The paper also highlights the trade-offs between robustness and vulnerability, providing valuable insights for future research.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Clarity in Methodology: While the paper is detailed, some sections (e.g., the mathematical formulation of adversarial models) are dense and could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.  
2. Broader Dataset Evaluation: The experiments are limited to MNIST and CIFAR-10. Including larger and more complex datasets (e.g., ImageNet) would strengthen the generalizability of the conclusions.  
3. Practical Considerations: The paper could discuss the computational cost of RAD and its scalability to real-world applications, as adversarial retraining can be resource-intensive.  
4. Comparison with Emerging Methods: The paper does not compare RAD with more recent adversarial defenses that may have been proposed after the cited works. Including such comparisons would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does the computational cost of RAD compare to other defenses like Distillation or IAEC? Could this limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments?  
2. Have you considered evaluating RAD on adversarial examples generated by more recent attack methods (e.g., PGD or AutoAttack)?  
3. How does RAD perform in multi-class classification settings, as opposed to the binary classification tasks evaluated in this paper?  
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of adversarial robustness and provides a solid foundation for future work. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its impact.
