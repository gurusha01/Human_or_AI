Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel "Variational Walkback" algorithm for training undirected graphical models with latent variables. The key contribution lies in proposing a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood, which facilitates a mixing-free training framework. The method leverages a walk-away and walk-back strategy to train a transition operator, aiming to locally carve the energy function in the right direction without requiring detailed sampling from the stationary distribution. The proposed algorithm eliminates the need for symmetric weights, making it more biologically plausible, and introduces a temperature annealing mechanism to efficiently address spurious modes. The paper also explores the potential of directly learning transition operators, bypassing the need for explicit energy functions. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, though results are visually underwhelming.
Decision: Reject
The paper presents an interesting idea with potential, but its execution is flawed and unconvincing in its current form. The primary concerns include theoretical inconsistencies, lack of clarity, and weak experimental results.
Supporting Arguments for Rejection
1. Theoretical Concerns: 
   - The choice of \( q(s | s') = p(s | s') \) results in mismatched forward and reverse trajectories, leading to a loose and high-variance variational bound. This undermines the theoretical foundation of the method.
   - The tightness claim in Appendix D is invalid because the learned transition distribution does not obey detailed balance, a critical assumption for the argument.
   - The dependence of \(\alpha\) on temperature in Eq. 12 and 13 is unspecified, leaving a gap in the explanation of the transition operator's behavior.
2. Experimental Weakness:
   - The results on CIFAR-10 and CelebA are visually unimpressive, likely due to the mismatch between generative and inference trajectories.
   - The paper optimizes a variational bound on log-likelihood but fails to report or compare log-likelihoods with competing methods, making it difficult to assess the model's performance quantitatively.
3. Clarity and Presentation Issues:
   - Several sections (e.g., Sec 1.2, Sec 2.1, Sec 2.2) are poorly worded and unclear, making it challenging to follow the proposed approach.
   - Figures 1, 2, and 3 suffer from labeling and clarity problems, which hinder understanding of the experimental results.
   - The number of walkback steps used in Fig. 3 is not specified, leaving ambiguity in the experimental setup.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Theoretical Improvements:
   - Consider learning an energy function and using an MCMC transition operator that obeys detailed balance to address the primary concern of trajectory mismatch.
   - Provide a clearer explanation of the dependence of \(\alpha\) on temperature in Eq. 12 and 13.
2. Experimental Enhancements:
   - Report log-likelihoods and compare them with state-of-the-art methods to provide a quantitative evaluation of the model.
   - Improve the visual quality of generated samples, potentially by addressing the forward/backward trajectory mismatch.
3. Clarity and Presentation:
   - Revise unclear sections (e.g., Sec 1.2, Sec 2.1, Sec 2.2) for better readability.
   - Fix labeling and clarity issues in figures and specify the number of walkback steps used in experiments.
4. Additional Suggestions:
   - Explore the relevance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the observation that noise variance increases with data distance, as it could provide insights into improving the proposed method.
   - Consider incorporating latent variables into the framework, as suggested in the conclusion, to enhance the model's expressiveness.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you justify the choice of \( q(s | s') = p(s | s') \), given that it leads to trajectory mismatches and a loose variational bound?
2. Can you provide a detailed explanation of how \(\alpha\) depends on temperature in Eq. 12 and 13?
3. Why were log-likelihoods not reported or compared with competing methods? How does the model perform quantitatively against baselines?
4. How many walkback steps were used in Fig. 3, and how does this choice impact the results?
5. Have you considered using an energy-based approach with detailed balance to address the primary concern of trajectory mismatch? If not, why? 
In summary, while the paper introduces an intriguing concept, significant theoretical, experimental, and clarity-related issues must be addressed before it can be considered for acceptance.
