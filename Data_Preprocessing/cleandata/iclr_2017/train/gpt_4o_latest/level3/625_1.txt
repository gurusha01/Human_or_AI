Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to achieve zero-shot generalization in instruction-based tasks. The proposed architecture consists of a meta-controller, which processes natural language instructions and selects subtasks, and a subtask controller, which executes primitive actions. Key innovations include the use of analogy-making regularization to enhance generalization to unseen subtasks and a differentiable mechanism for learning temporal abstractions in the meta-controller. The framework is evaluated in both a 2D grid world and a 3D visual environment, demonstrating its ability to generalize to longer and unseen sequences of instructions. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the learned policies and propose curriculum learning strategies to stabilize training.
Decision: Reject
While the paper proposes a promising hierarchical RL framework and introduces novel techniques like analogy-making regularization, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are:
1. Insufficient Evaluation on Large-Scale Tasks: The testing environment (10x10 grid world) is too simplistic to validate the scalability claims of the proposed architecture.
2. Lack of Comparisons with State-of-the-Art: The paper does not benchmark its method against existing state-of-the-art hierarchical RL approaches, making it difficult to contextualize its contributions.
3. Unclear Subtask Combination Rationale: The method for combining subtask embeddings in the subtask controller lacks theoretical justification or empirical validation.
Supporting Arguments
1. Task Scale: The motivation for the work is to scale RL agents to large and complex tasks. However, the evaluation is limited to small environments (10x10 grid world and a constrained 3D visual environment). This undermines the claim that the architecture can handle large-scale tasks.
2. Comparative Baselines: The paper compares its hierarchical approach only to a flat controller. While the hierarchical approach outperforms the flat baseline, the absence of comparisons with other hierarchical RL methods (e.g., option-critic or programmable HAM) leaves a significant gap in the evaluation.
3. Subtask Embedding Design: The use of analogy-making regularization is intriguing, but the rationale for how subtask embeddings are combined is not well-explained. This design choice should be better justified or supported by ablation studies.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Testing Environments: Evaluate the proposed method in larger and more complex environments to better align with the paper's stated goals of handling large-scale tasks.
2. Include State-of-the-Art Comparisons: Benchmark the proposed architecture against established hierarchical RL methods to provide a clearer understanding of its relative strengths and weaknesses.
3. Clarify Subtask Embedding Design: Provide a theoretical or empirical justification for the specific method of combining subtask embeddings. Ablation studies could help clarify the importance of this design choice.
4. Broader Task Diversity: Incorporate tasks with richer instruction sets, such as conditional statements or loops, to demonstrate the architecture's versatility.
Questions for the Authors
1. What is the rationale behind the specific method of combining subtask embeddings in the subtask controller? Could alternative methods improve performance?
2. How would the architecture perform in larger and more complex environments? Have you considered testing in domains like robotic manipulation or navigation in real-world-like settings?
3. Why were comparisons with state-of-the-art hierarchical RL methods omitted? Would such comparisons be feasible in future work?
In summary, while the paper introduces several interesting ideas, its limitations in evaluation and contextualization within the broader RL literature prevent it from making a strong case for acceptance at this time. Addressing these concerns could significantly strengthen the work.
