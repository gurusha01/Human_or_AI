The paper explores the application of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM) to the challenging task of bioacoustic signal segmentation, specifically focusing on humpback whale and bird sounds. The authors argue that HDP-HMM, as a Bayesian non-parametric method, is well-suited for unsupervised segmentation of bioacoustic data, as it can infer the number of hidden states automatically, addressing a key limitation of traditional HMMs. The paper demonstrates the method's potential by applying it to real-world datasets, showing promising results in segmenting acoustic signals into meaningful song units. The authors also highlight the potential ecological and behavioral insights that such segmentation can provide, particularly for species monitoring and conservation efforts.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses an important problem in bioacoustics and demonstrates the utility of HDP-HMM in this domain, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of a fair comparison with simpler baseline methods and the high computational cost of the proposed approach, which is not adequately justified or mitigated.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Lack of Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not include comparisons with simpler, widely-used methods like Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-based HMMs. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess whether the added complexity and computational cost of HDP-HMM provide a significant advantage over simpler methods.
2. High Computational Cost: The HDP-HMM approach relies on computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which limits its scalability to larger datasets. The authors acknowledge this limitation but do not propose or evaluate alternative methods, such as variational inference, to address this issue.
3. Limited Evaluation Metrics: While the paper uses Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to evaluate bird song segmentation, the results indicate significant variability across species, with some species performing poorly. The authors do not provide sufficient analysis or discussion on how to improve performance for these challenging cases.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include a comprehensive comparison with simpler methods like BIC- and AIC-based HMMs to establish the added value of HDP-HMM in this context.
2. Explore and evaluate computationally efficient alternatives, such as variational inference or stochastic methods, to make the approach more scalable.
3. Provide a more detailed analysis of species-specific segmentation challenges and propose strategies to address them, such as improved feature extraction or noise reduction techniques.
4. Discuss the ecological and behavioral implications of the segmentation results in greater depth to strengthen the paper's impact and relevance.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of HDP-HMM compare to simpler methods like BIC- or AIC-based HMMs in terms of segmentation quality and computational efficiency?
2. Could variational inference or other approximate methods be used to reduce the computational cost of HDP-HMM?
3. What specific improvements in feature extraction or noise reduction could enhance segmentation performance for species with complex acoustic behaviors?
In summary, while the paper tackles an interesting and challenging problem, it requires significant improvements in baseline comparisons, computational efficiency, and evaluation rigor to be suitable for acceptance.
