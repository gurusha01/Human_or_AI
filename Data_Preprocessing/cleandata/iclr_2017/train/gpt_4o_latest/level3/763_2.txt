The paper proposes a neural network-based approach, termed Relational Dynamic model with Gaussian representations (RDG), for modeling correlated time series by leveraging Gaussian embeddings in a latent space. The model incorporates uncertainty at both the observation and dynamic levels, which is a less explored area in neural networks for relational time series. The paper introduces a novel combination of loss functions to capture data fit, temporal dynamics, and pairwise relations (provided as prior information). The authors demonstrate the model's ability to forecast time series and provide confidence intervals for predictions, showcasing its utility in uncertainty quantification. Experimental results on four datasets suggest competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements attributed to the inclusion of structural regularization and uncertainty modeling.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are (1) the lack of a principled treatment of uncertainty, which undermines the novelty and rigor of the proposed approach, and (2) the unconvincing experimental results, which fail to demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods.
Supporting Arguments
1. Uncertainty Modeling: While the paper emphasizes uncertainty handling as a key contribution, the approach lacks depth. The use of Gaussian embeddings is straightforward but does not leverage more sophisticated frameworks like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Bayesian methods, which are standard in uncertainty-aware modeling. The Gaussian covariance collapses into variance, limiting the ability to model complex correlations between series.
2. Decoding and Dynamics: The restriction to linear decoding functions significantly limits the model's expressiveness, especially when compared to state-of-the-art methods like Gaussian Processes or advanced RNN architectures. Although a non-linear dynamic function is explored, its impact is not thoroughly analyzed.
3. Experimental Results: The results are not compelling. While the model performs competitively, it does not consistently outperform baselines like RNNs or Kalman Filters. The sensitivity of the model to different regularizers is not well-explored, and optimized parameter values (e.g., Î») are not reported, leaving gaps in understanding the method's behavior.
4. Practicality of Prior Information: The reliance on a predefined correlation structure is novel but impractical for many real-world applications where such information is unavailable or difficult to define. This oversimplifies the complexity of relational dependencies.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Uncertainty Modeling: Incorporate more principled approaches to uncertainty, such as VAEs or Bayesian neural networks, to strengthen the theoretical foundation and improve the model's ability to capture correlations.
2. Decoding Flexibility: Explore non-linear decoding functions to enhance the model's expressiveness and better compete with state-of-the-art methods.
3. Experimental Rigor: Provide a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity to hyperparameters and the effects of different loss components. Report optimized parameter values to offer insights into the model's behavior.
4. Realistic Assumptions: Address the impracticality of requiring prior correlation structures by exploring methods to learn these relationships directly from data.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform when the prior correlation structure is noisy or incomplete? Can the model learn these dependencies directly?
2. Why was a VAE or similar framework not considered for uncertainty modeling, given its relevance to the problem?
3. Can the authors provide more detailed results on the sensitivity of the model to different regularizers and hyperparameters?
4. How does the model scale with the number of time series and the complexity of their relationships?
In summary, while the paper addresses an important problem and introduces an interesting combination of loss functions, the lack of rigor in uncertainty modeling, limited decoding flexibility, and unconvincing experimental results weaken its contributions. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the impact and applicability of the proposed approach.
