Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel methodology for analyzing sentence embeddings by evaluating their ability to encode three fundamental sentence properties: sentence length, word content, and word order. The authors conduct experiments on several popular embedding methods, including continuous bag-of-words (CBOW), LSTM-based autoencoders, and skip-thought vectors, providing a fine-grained comparison of their representational capabilities. The study reveals several interesting insights, such as the unexpected ability of CBOW embeddings to encode sentence length and partial word order, as well as the limitations of BLEU scores in evaluating encoder quality. The work addresses an under-explored but critical area in natural language processing (NLP): understanding the information encoded in sentence representations. Despite its limitations, the paper makes an important contribution to the field and lays the groundwork for future research.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contribution to understanding sentence embeddings, a critical yet under-researched area in NLP. The methodology is well-motivated, the experiments are thoughtfully designed, and the findings provide actionable insights for both researchers and practitioners. While the evaluations are somewhat simplistic and not directly tied to downstream tasks, this limitation is acknowledged by the authors and does not detract from the paper's overall value.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clear Problem Definition and Motivation: The paper tackles the important question of what linguistic properties are encoded in sentence embeddings, an area that has received limited attention compared to downstream task evaluations. The proposed methodology is general and can be applied to any sentence representation model, making it a valuable tool for future research.
   
2. Rigorous Experimental Design: The authors employ well-defined prediction tasks to isolate specific aspects of sentence structure. The use of multiple embedding methods and controlled experiments (e.g., with permuted sentences) strengthens the validity of the findings.
3. Key Insights: The study provides several notable findings, such as the surprising effectiveness of CBOW embeddings in encoding sentence length and partial word order, and the observation that LSTM autoencoders do not rely heavily on natural language word order. These insights challenge existing assumptions and open new avenues for research.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Beyond Low-Level Properties: While the focus on sentence length, word content, and word order is a good starting point, future work should explore higher-level syntactic and semantic properties. This would make the methodology more directly relevant to real-world applications.
2. Real-World Relevance: The authors acknowledge that the evaluated tasks are not directly tied to downstream applications. Including experiments on tasks like sentiment analysis or machine translation could strengthen the practical relevance of the findings.
3. Broader Dataset: The experiments are conducted on a single dataset (Wikipedia sentences). Testing on diverse datasets, including those with different linguistic structures, would help validate the generalizability of the results.
4. Explainability of CBOW Results: The paper attributes CBOW's ability to encode sentence length to statistical properties like concentration inequalities. However, a more detailed mathematical analysis or visualization would enhance the clarity of this explanation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you envision extending this methodology to evaluate higher-level linguistic properties, such as syntactic structure or semantic similarity?
2. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of your methodology compared to traditional downstream task evaluations?
3. Did you observe any differences in performance when using different pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe vs. word2vec) for the CBOW model?
Overall, this paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of NLP and provides a solid foundation for future research on sentence embeddings. The proposed methodology is both innovative and practical, and the findings are insightful and thought-provoking.
