The paper presents a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) transduction by reformulating it as a noisy channel decoding problem. The authors propose an online variant of segment-to-segment transducers, enabling predictions without observing the entire input sequence. This is achieved by leveraging a latent alignment variable and integrating independent priors such as grammar and sentence length into a Bayesian framework. The model is validated through experiments on abstractive summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection, showing promising results, particularly in leveraging unpaired output data.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Decision:
1. Innovative Contribution: The paper introduces a Bayesian framework for seq2seq models, which combines multiple information sources (e.g., direct model, language model, and channel model) in a principled manner. This is a significant step forward in addressing the limitations of direct models, such as explaining-away effects.
2. Community Relevance: The focus on online processing and the ability to utilize unpaired data are highly relevant to the community, addressing practical challenges in low-resource scenarios.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results demonstrate strong performance across tasks, with the noisy channel model outperforming direct models in many cases. The use of unpaired data is particularly impactful, as shown in summarization and translation tasks.
Supporting Arguments:
- The proposed model effectively tackles the computational challenges of noisy channel decoding by introducing a latent alignment variable, enabling tractable beam search decoding.
- The experiments are well-designed, covering diverse tasks (summarization, translation, and inflection) and demonstrating the model's versatility.
- The combination of direct and noisy channel models yields further improvements, highlighting the complementary strengths of the two approaches.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Baselines and Comparisons: The paper does not include a baseline that combines direct, language model, and bias contributions without the channel component. Including this would clarify the unique contribution of the channel model.
2. Computational Complexity: While the model is innovative, it does not improve computational complexity compared to Tillmann et al. (1997), which limits its applicability for long inputs. A discussion on potential optimizations or trade-offs would be valuable.
3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the model to hyperparameters in Eq. (3) is not thoroughly analyzed. Details on whether a systematic search strategy was used would improve reproducibility.
4. Pruning Variables: The importance of pruning variables (K1 and K2) is mentioned but not elaborated. A deeper analysis of their impact on performance and computational efficiency would strengthen the paper.
5. Conceptual Clarifications: The differences from Tillmann et al. (1997) beyond the use of connectionist models need clearer articulation. Additionally, the claim of "no Markovian assumptions" in Section 2 should be clarified (e.g., does this refer to first-order Markov assumptions?).
Questions for Authors:
1. Why was a baseline combining direct, language model, and bias contributions without the channel model excluded? Would this baseline not provide a clearer understanding of the channel model's impact?
2. How sensitive is the model to the choice of pruning variables (K1 and K2)? Could you provide empirical results or guidelines for selecting these parameters?
3. Could you elaborate on the computational trade-offs of your approach compared to Tillmann et al. (1997)? Are there specific scenarios where your model is more advantageous despite similar complexity?
Minor Comments:
- Table 1 contains a typo: "chanel" should be corrected to "channel."
- The auxiliary direct model used in decoding could be described in more detail for clarity.
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to seq2seq modeling by introducing a noisy channel framework that effectively leverages unpaired data and addresses key limitations of direct models. While there are areas for improvement, the strengths of the proposed approach and its relevance to the community justify acceptance.
