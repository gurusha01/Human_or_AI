Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel approach to generalizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for graph-structured data by introducing a graph convolution framework based on random walks. The method selects relevant nodes using a transition matrix and incorporates a tunable parameter \( k \), which determines the number of steps in the random walk. The authors demonstrate the method's parameter efficiency and computational feasibility, as the additional computations occur only during pre-processing. Empirical results on the Merck molecular activity dataset and MNIST dataset show competitive or state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the potential of the proposed graph CNN for regression and classification tasks.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting and computationally efficient approach to graph convolutions, the lack of rigorous experimental justification for the key hyperparameter \( k \) and the limited scope of the experiments weaken the paper's contributions. Specifically, the absence of a direct comparison between \( k = 1 \) and \( k > 1 \) undermines the claim that the proposed method provides a meaningful improvement over existing approaches. Additionally, the experiments on MNIST do not convincingly demonstrate the advantage of the graph CNN over standard CNNs or fully connected networks.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Justification for \( k > 1 \) is insufficient: The paper introduces \( k \) as a tunable parameter to extend the neighborhood in the graph convolution. However, one of the key experiments (Merck) shows that \( k = 1 \) performs better than \( k > 1 \), and in the MNIST experiment, \( k = 1 \) is used without further exploration. This raises questions about the necessity of \( k > 1 \) and whether the added complexity of this hyperparameter is justified.
2. Limited experimental evaluation: The experiments are not comprehensive enough to support the claims. For instance, the MNIST experiment does not convincingly demonstrate the advantage of the graph CNN, as the error rate (1.1%) is worse than that of a standard CNN (0.75%). Furthermore, the Merck dataset results lack a detailed comparison with \( k > 1 \), and the performance improvement over baselines is not substantial enough to validate the proposed method's superiority.
3. Scientific rigor: While the theoretical formulation of the graph convolution is sound, the empirical results do not consistently support the claims. The absence of ablation studies or sensitivity analyses for \( k \) and other hyperparameters limits the robustness of the conclusions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Stronger experimental justification for \( k > 1 \): The authors should include experiments that directly compare \( k = 1 \) and \( k > 1 \) across multiple datasets. If \( k > 1 \) provides no significant improvement, the authors should consider simplifying the method by removing \( k \) as a hyperparameter.
2. Broader evaluation: The paper would benefit from experiments on additional datasets, particularly those with inherent graph structures (e.g., citation networks or social networks). This would better demonstrate the method's generalizability.
3. Pooling on graphs: The authors mention that efficient pooling methods for graphs are a direction for future research. Including even a basic pooling mechanism in this paper could strengthen the proposed method's applicability and performance.
4. Clarification of computational efficiency: While the paper claims that the graph convolution is computationally efficient, a detailed comparison of runtime and memory usage with existing graph convolution methods (e.g., spectral approaches) would make this claim more convincing.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of \( k \) on performance? Specifically, why does \( k = 1 \) perform better in some cases, and how does \( k > 1 \) contribute to the model's expressiveness?
2. How does the proposed method compare to other graph convolution methods (e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks by Kipf & Welling, 2017) in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency?
3. Have you considered datasets with more complex graph structures (e.g., citation networks) to further validate the method?
In conclusion, while the paper presents a novel and promising approach to graph convolutions, the lack of experimental rigor and justification for key design choices prevents it from making a strong contribution to the field at this time. Addressing the outlined concerns could significantly improve the paper's impact.
