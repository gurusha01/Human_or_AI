Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a Joint Many-Task (JMT) model for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging a transfer learning approach that respects a linguistic complexity hierarchy (from syntactic to semantic tasks). The novelty lies in its cascaded architecture, where increasingly complex tasks are handled at deeper layers of a single end-to-end trainable model. Shortcut connections and successive regularization are employed to prevent catastrophic interference and to allow for mutual benefits across tasks. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on chunking, dependency parsing, semantic relatedness, and textual entailment, while performing competitively on POS tagging. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the model's architecture and training strategies, highlighting the importance of task-specific transformations and shared embeddings.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper proposes a unique cascaded architecture for multi-task learning in NLP, which respects linguistic hierarchies and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks. This is a significant contribution to the field of transfer learning and multi-task NLP.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are robust, with comprehensive comparisons to prior work and ablation studies that validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods (e.g., successive regularization, shortcut connections).
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses a well-defined problem: how to jointly train multiple NLP tasks of varying complexity in a single model while avoiding catastrophic interference. The motivation is clear, as traditional pipelines and flat multi-task approaches fail to capture hierarchical dependencies between tasks.
2. Placement in Literature: While the paper acknowledges relevant prior work (e.g., SÃ¸gaard & Goldberg, 2016; Rusu et al., 2016), it could delve deeper into comparisons with existing cascaded or hierarchical models in NLP. Nonetheless, the novelty of the proposed approach is evident.
3. Scientific Rigor: The claims are well-supported by empirical results. The model's performance on five tasks, along with ablation studies, demonstrates its effectiveness. The use of successive regularization and shortcut connections is convincingly shown to improve performance, particularly for tasks with imbalanced datasets.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Literature Review: The related work section could be expanded to include a deeper discussion of existing cascaded architectures and their limitations compared to the proposed model.
2. Analysis of Errors: While the paper provides some error analysis (e.g., on dependency parsing and textual entailment), a more detailed exploration of failure cases could offer insights into potential weaknesses of the model.
3. Scalability: The paper could discuss the scalability of the JMT model to additional tasks or larger datasets, as well as its computational efficiency compared to traditional multi-task models.
4. External Resources: The authors mention the potential use of external resources (e.g., dictionaries for antonyms/synonyms) to improve semantic tasks. Including preliminary experiments or a discussion on this would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform when additional tasks are added, especially tasks that do not fit neatly into the syntactic-to-semantic hierarchy?
2. Can the proposed successive regularization technique be generalized to other domains or architectures beyond NLP?
3. How computationally expensive is the JMT model compared to traditional multi-task models, and what trade-offs are involved?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to multi-task learning in NLP and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. The proposed architecture and training strategies are innovative and empirically validated, though there is room for further exploration and refinement.
