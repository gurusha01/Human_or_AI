Review
Summary of the Paper
This paper introduces a novel approach to handwritten word recognition by leveraging Open Bigrams (OBs) as the target representation, inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on reading. The authors propose a decoding method that predicts OBs using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) and retrieves words from a vocabulary using cosine similarity. The OB representation captures long-range dependencies and redundancy, potentially improving robustness to recognition errors. Experiments conducted on the Rimes and IAM datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to conventional character-sequence-based approaches. The paper highlights the cognitive plausibility of OBs and their potential as an alternative representation for word recognition.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an innovative idea and is well-written, it lacks sufficient empirical rigor and contextualization within the existing literature. The following key reasons inform this decision:
1. Insufficient Comparisons to State-of-the-Art: The paper does not benchmark its results against established state-of-the-art methods, relying instead on author-generated baselines. This makes it difficult to assess the true impact of the proposed approach.
2. Limited Ablation Studies: The source of performance improvements is unclear due to the lack of detailed ablation studies. It is not evident whether the gains stem from the OB representation, the RNN architecture, or other factors.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Clarity: The use of OBs as a representation for word recognition is novel and intriguing. The paper is clearly written, with a logical flow and detailed explanations of the methodology. The cognitive neuroscience motivation is compelling and adds an interdisciplinary dimension to the work.
2. Empirical Weaknesses: The experimental results, while promising, are not adequately contextualized. The paper does not compare its performance to other related approaches, such as bag-of-bigrams or n-grams models, which are conceptually similar. This omission weakens the claim that OBs are a superior representation.
3. Ablation and Analysis: The lack of ablation studies leaves open questions about the contribution of different components (e.g., OB representation, cosine similarity decoder, RNN architecture). Additionally, the error analysis is insufficiently detailed to understand the failure modes of the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Benchmarking: Include comparisons to state-of-the-art methods for handwritten word recognition, such as those based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or hybrid approaches. This would provide a clearer picture of the proposed method's relative performance.
2. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation experiments to isolate the impact of the OB representation, the RNN architecture, and the decoding method. For example, compare the OB-based decoder to a character-sequence-based decoder using the same RNN.
3. Related Work: Explore and discuss related works that use bag-of-bigrams or n-grams models. Highlight the differences and advantages of OBs over these representations.
4. Error Analysis: Provide a more detailed error analysis to identify specific scenarios where the OB-based approach outperforms or underperforms compared to traditional methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed OB-based method compare to other n-gram or bag-of-bigrams approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
2. Can you provide more details on the choice of cosine similarity for decoding? Have alternative similarity measures been considered?
3. What is the rationale for limiting the bigram order to three? Would higher-order bigrams improve performance, and if so, at what computational cost?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an exciting and novel idea, it requires stronger empirical validation and contextualization within the broader landscape of handwritten word recognition research. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the paper's impact and credibility.
