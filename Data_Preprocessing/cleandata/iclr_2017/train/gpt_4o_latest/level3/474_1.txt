Review of "MUS-ROVER II: Hierarchical Rule Learning for Music Theory"
Summary of Contributions
This paper builds on the authors' previous work, MUS-ROVER, to propose MUS-ROVER II, a system for hierarchical rule learning in music theory. The focus is on improving interpretability by introducing conceptual and informational hierarchies, adaptive memory selection, and a more dynamic rule-learning process. The system generates customizable syllabi for learning compositional rules, demonstrated on Bach's chorales. The authors claim that MUS-ROVER II provides deeper insights into the rule-learning process, making it more cognitive and suitable for music pedagogy. They also highlight potential applications in style recognition, synthesis, and beyond music.
Decision: Reject (for ICLR)
While the paper presents valuable ideas and a promising approach, it is not yet suitable for ICLR in its current form. The primary reasons for this decision are the paper's dense presentation, which limits accessibility, and the mismatch between the conference format and the depth of the work. A long-form journal publication would be more appropriate to fully articulate the contributions and provide the necessary clarity.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clarity and Accessibility: Despite the reviewer's familiarity with related concepts, the paper is difficult to follow due to the extensive use of notation and dense explanations. Key ideas, such as the hierarchical organization of rules and adaptive memory selection, are compelling but require clearer exposition and illustrative examples. The current format does not allow sufficient space to unpack these ideas for a broader audience.
2. Scope and Suitability: The contributions are significant but better suited to a journal, where the authors could expand on the methodology, provide additional datasets, and demonstrate broader generality. The conference format feels restrictive for adequately describing the hierarchical rule-learning process and its implications.
3. Scientific Rigor: The results are promising, but the paper lacks sufficient empirical evidence to support claims of scalability and generality. For example, the computational feasibility of the approach in scenarios with more instruments or longer pieces is not addressed in detail.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity and Organization: Simplify the presentation by reducing the reliance on dense notation. Use more diagrams, examples, and intuitive explanations to convey key ideas. For instance, visualizing the conceptual and informational hierarchies with concrete examples would enhance understanding.
2. Scalability and Feasibility: Address the computational feasibility of the approach in more complex scenarios, such as larger datasets or compositions with more instruments. This would strengthen the claims of generality and practical applicability.
3. Expanded Evaluation: Include experiments on diverse datasets beyond Bach's chorales to demonstrate the generality of the approach. Comparative evaluations with existing methods in music theory or style recognition would also be valuable.
4. Hierarchical Applications: The hierarchical organization of orchestration rules is an intriguing direction. Expanding on this application with concrete examples and experiments could make the work more impactful.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does MUS-ROVER II scale to compositions with more instruments or longer pieces? Are there computational bottlenecks in the hierarchical rule-learning process?
2. Can the authors provide more concrete examples of how the conceptual and informational hierarchies improve interpretability compared to MUS-ROVER I?
3. How generalizable is the approach to other musical styles or genres beyond Bach's chorales? Have any preliminary experiments been conducted in this direction?
In conclusion, MUS-ROVER II presents a valuable contribution to music theory and AI, but the paper requires significant revisions to improve clarity, expand empirical evidence, and address scalability concerns. A journal submission would provide the space needed to fully realize the potential of this work.
