Review of "Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis for Multi-Modality Neural Networks"
The paper proposes a novel extension of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) by introducing a fully differentiable version that can be integrated as a layer within neural networks. The authors claim that this differentiable CCA enables gradient flow through the CCA projection matrices, providing flexibility in optimization objectives. The method is evaluated in a cross-modality retrieval task, demonstrating improved performance over Deep CCA (DCCA) on two datasets. The authors argue that their approach could serve as a general-purpose building block for multi-modality tasks.
Decision: Reject
Key reasons for rejection include the lack of clarity in the paper's objectives and methodology, and insufficient evidence supporting the claims. Specifically:
1. The main objective of the paper is ambiguous. While the authors aim to extend DCCA, it is unclear whether the focus is on improving retrieval performance, addressing differentiability issues, or providing computational efficiency.
2. The relationship between the retrieval objective and the proposed "CCA layer" is inadequately explained. Section 3 lacks the necessary equations and discussion to establish this connection rigorously.
3. The computational efficiency advantage is questionable, as the method still relies on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of T, which is computationally expensive.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Unclear Objective: The paper does not explicitly state why addressing the non-differentiability of the CCA objective is critical, especially since prior work (e.g., DCCA) has not reported significant training issues due to this limitation.
2. Methodological Gaps: The reformulation of the CCA objective to address differentiability is mentioned but not adequately detailed. The paper does not clarify how the trace norm of T is handled or reformulated.
3. Evaluation Concerns: While the proposed method shows performance gains, the lack of a comparison with contrastive loss—a widely used baseline for retrieval tasks—limits the strength of the empirical claims.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Clarity of Objectives: The authors should clearly articulate the primary goal of the paper. Is the focus on improving retrieval performance, enabling differentiability, or computational efficiency? This would help readers better understand the contributions.
2. Technical Details: The paper should include detailed equations and discussions in Section 3 to explain how the retrieval objective interacts with the CCA layer. For instance, how does the proposed method optimize cosine distance while maintaining the properties of CCA projections?
3. Efficiency Analysis: The claim of computational efficiency should be substantiated with a detailed analysis. If SVD is still required, the authors should explain how their approach reduces computational overhead compared to DCCA.
4. Baseline Comparisons: A comparison with contrastive loss or other retrieval-specific objectives would strengthen the evaluation. This would help assess whether the proposed method offers unique advantages or simply benefits from task-specific optimization.
5. Paper Organization: Introducing the retrieval objective earlier in the paper would improve readability and provide context for the proposed method.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method reformulate the trace norm of T to address differentiability? Are there any trade-offs introduced by this reformulation?
2. Why is addressing the non-differentiability of the CCA objective critical, given that DCCA has been effective in practice?
3. Can the authors provide a computational complexity analysis comparing their method with DCCA, particularly focusing on the SVD step?
4. How does the retrieval objective interact with the differentiable CCA layer? Could you provide equations or a more detailed explanation in Section 3?
5. Why was contrastive loss not included as a baseline in the experiments?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting idea, it lacks clarity and rigor in its objectives, methodology, and evaluation. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
