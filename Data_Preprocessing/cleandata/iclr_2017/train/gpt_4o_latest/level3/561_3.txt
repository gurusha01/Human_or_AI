Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes an innovative application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to construct a "Tree of Life" (ToL) for biological species based on visual similarity. The authors leverage the hierarchical feature representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet to infer phylogenetic relationships. They introduce methods to compute species similarity using activation vectors and propose three approaches—Approximation Central Point (ACP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)—to construct the tree. The paper also explores the applicability of this method to non-biological categories, such as vehicles, and claims that the results are competitive with human performance. The authors argue that their work provides insights into deep feature representations and opens new avenues for applying deep learning in bioinformatics.
Decision: Reject  
The primary reasons for rejection are (1) the lack of biological grounding and (2) insufficient evidence to support the claims of utility and rigor. While the paper demonstrates technical creativity, its contributions are undermined by methodological and conceptual weaknesses.
Supporting Arguments
1. Biological Relevance and Grounding: The paper relies on WordNet hierarchies as ground truth for evaluating the constructed trees. However, WordNet is a lexical database and does not reflect biological inheritance relationships. This misalignment undermines the validity of the results in the context of evolutionary biology. The authors do not provide evidence that their method aligns with phylogenetic trees derived from genetic or morphological data, which are the standard in biology.
2. Tree Structure and Semantic Nuances: The imposition of a tree structure for visual relationships is questionable. Biological evolution often involves reticulate patterns (e.g., horizontal gene transfer), which cannot be captured by a strict tree structure. Additionally, the method does not account for semantic nuances in visual features, leading to potential oversimplifications.
3. Evaluation and Claims: The claim that the method is "highly competitive to human beings" is not rigorously substantiated. The human baseline comparison is vague, relying on qualitative observations rather than quantitative metrics. Furthermore, the experiments focus on visual similarity rather than biological inheritance, which limits the scope of the conclusions.
4. Generalization and Applicability: While the paper explores the construction of hierarchical trees for non-biological categories (e.g., vehicles), the relevance of these results to the primary goal of constructing a biologically meaningful ToL is unclear. The authors also fail to address the challenge of recovering biological inheritance trees from visual inputs effectively.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Biological Validation: Incorporate datasets and ground truth derived from established phylogenetic methods (e.g., genetic or morphological data) to evaluate the constructed trees. This would provide stronger evidence of biological relevance.
2. Semantic and Structural Flexibility: Explore alternative representations (e.g., networks or graphs) that can capture non-tree-like relationships in biological evolution. Additionally, consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge to refine the similarity metrics.
3. Human Baseline and Experimental Rigor: Provide a clear and quantitative comparison to human performance. Include rigorous experimental setups to validate the claims about the method's utility and accuracy.
4. Feature Analysis: Conduct a detailed analysis of the visual features learned by the networks and their relevance to biological traits. This would strengthen the claim that the method provides insights into deep feature representations.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you justify the use of WordNet hierarchies as a proxy for biological inheritance relationships, given their lexical rather than biological nature?
2. Have you considered validating your method against phylogenetic trees constructed from genetic data? If not, why?
3. How do you address the limitations of tree structures in capturing evolutionary relationships that involve reticulation or hybridization?
4. Can you provide quantitative metrics for the human baseline comparison to substantiate the claim that your method is "highly competitive"?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting and creative application of deep learning, it falls short in terms of biological relevance, methodological rigor, and empirical validation. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the impact and credibility of the work.
