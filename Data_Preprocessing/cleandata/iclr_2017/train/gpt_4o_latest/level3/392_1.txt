Review of the Paper: "Optimizing Autoencoders for Lossy Image Compression"
Summary of Contributions  
This paper introduces a novel approach to lossy image compression using autoencoders. The authors propose a method to address the non-differentiability of the compression loss, enabling effective training of deep autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance with JPEG 2000 in terms of perceptual quality and outperforms recent neural network-based approaches. The paper also highlights the flexibility of the framework, which can be optimized for specific content and metrics, and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for high-resolution images. The authors provide detailed descriptions of their architecture, training methodology, and experimental results, ensuring reproducibility.
Decision: Accept with Minor Revisions  
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of neural network-based image compression by proposing a novel solution to a challenging problem. The approach is well-motivated, and the results are promising, even though they do not yet surpass traditional state-of-the-art methods like JPEG 2000. The clarity of the paper and the detailed experimental evaluation further strengthen its case for acceptance. However, there are some areas that require improvement, particularly regarding the training complexity and the unclear relevance of Figure 1.
Supporting Arguments  
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper tackles the challenging problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression, a task hindered by non-differentiability. The proposed solution is simple yet effective, and the motivation for using autoencoders as a flexible alternative to traditional codecs is well-articulated. The work is positioned appropriately within the existing literature, with clear distinctions from related methods.  
2. Scientific Rigor: The experimental results are thorough, evaluating the method on multiple metrics (PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM) and comparing it against established methods like JPEG, JPEG 2000, and RNN-based approaches. The use of a mean opinion score (MOS) test adds further credibility to the perceptual quality claims.  
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper is well-written, with sufficient detail provided about the architecture, training process, and evaluation methodology. This ensures that the work can be reproduced by others in the field.
Additional Feedback for Improvement  
1. Training Complexity: The training process involves multiple stages, including weight freezing and incremental coefficient optimization, which adds significant complexity. Simplifying this process or providing a more detailed justification for its necessity would strengthen the paper.  
2. Figure 1: The motivation and relevance of Figure 1 are unclear. It appears to illustrate alternative approaches but does not directly connect to the proposed method. The authors should clarify its purpose or consider removing it.  
3. State-of-the-Art Comparison: While the method performs competitively with JPEG 2000, it does not consistently surpass it. The authors should discuss this limitation more explicitly and outline potential future directions to close this gap.  
4. Broader Applicability: The paper mentions flexibility for different content types and metrics but does not provide concrete examples or experiments demonstrating this capability. Including such examples would strengthen the claims of generalizability.
Questions for the Authors  
1. Can the training process be simplified without compromising performance? If not, what specific benefits justify the added complexity?  
2. What is the intended takeaway from Figure 1, and how does it relate to the proposed method?  
3. Have you tested the method on non-natural images or other media formats (e.g., 360 video, VR content) to validate its flexibility?  
4. Could the proposed method be combined with perceptual metrics or GANs to further improve performance, as suggested in the discussion?
In conclusion, this paper presents a valuable contribution to neural network-based image compression. Addressing the minor concerns raised above would further enhance its impact and clarity.
