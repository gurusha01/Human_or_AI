Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for learning compact binary data representations using a dynamic partition model. The authors aim to address the challenge of assigning responsibility for individual variables to specific experts, thereby creating a more interpretable and parsimonious representation. The proposed model dynamically partitions variables based on the expertise of active experts, which is claimed to improve the accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstructions. The authors also introduce a smoothed version of the model to facilitate learning and provide experimental results on synthetic datasets, MNIST digits, Weizmann horses, and Caltech motorcycles to demonstrate the model's effectiveness.
Decision: Reject
The paper is not ready for publication due to significant issues in clarity, organization, and scientific rigor. The main reasons for rejection are:
1. Lack of clarity in problem formulation: The paper fails to clearly define the problem it aims to solve, making it difficult to understand the scope and significance of the contributions.
2. Insufficient placement in the literature: The related work section is fragmented, with references scattered throughout the paper, and does not provide a coherent comparison with existing methods.
3. Lack of derivations and references: Key claims are made without adequate derivations or proper citations, undermining the scientific rigor of the work.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clarity and Accessibility: The writing is dense and assumes a high level of familiarity with the topic, which makes it inaccessible to readers unfamiliar with the specific area of research. Even after multiple readings, the problem setting and contributions remain unclear.
2. Related Work: The related work section is insufficiently developed. While the authors mention several relevant models (e.g., products of experts, autoencoders), the comparisons are scattered and lack depth. A dedicated and structured related work section would help contextualize the contributions.
3. Scientific Rigor: The paper lacks derivations for key equations and provides limited references to support its claims. For example, the proposed dynamic partition model's theoretical underpinnings are not adequately justified, and the experimental results are not rigorously analyzed.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify the Problem Setting: Clearly define the problem being addressed and explain its importance in the context of representation learning. Use simple language to make the work accessible to a broader audience.
2. Organize Related Work: Consolidate the discussion of related work into a dedicated section. Provide a structured comparison with existing methods, highlighting the novelty and advantages of the proposed approach.
3. Provide Derivations and References: Include detailed derivations for key equations and ensure all claims are supported by proper references to the literature.
4. Improve Writing and Organization: Simplify the writing and improve the paper's structure to enhance readability. Clearly separate the methodological contributions, experimental results, and discussions.
5. Expand Experimental Analysis: Provide more detailed and quantitative comparisons with baseline methods to substantiate the claims of improved performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a clearer and more concise explanation of the problem setting and how the proposed model addresses it?
2. How does the proposed dynamic partition model compare quantitatively with existing methods like products of experts and autoencoders in terms of reconstruction accuracy and interpretability?
3. Why is the related work section scattered throughout the paper instead of being consolidated into a single section?
4. Can you include derivations for the key equations (e.g., Equation 2) and provide references for the claims made in the paper?
In its current state, the paper requires significant revisions to be considered for publication. The proposed ideas are potentially interesting, but the lack of clarity, rigor, and organization significantly detracts from their impact.
