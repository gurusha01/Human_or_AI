Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces Submodular Sum-Product Networks (SSPNs), a novel extension of classical Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) that incorporates submodular energy functions. This innovation allows SSPNs to efficiently compute the MAP state for a combinatorial number of labelings, making them particularly relevant for complex tasks like semantic segmentation. The authors propose INFERSSPN, an efficient, convergent algorithm based on graph cuts for approximate inference in SSPNs. The paper claims exponential improvements in parsing time compared to traditional methods like α-expansion and belief propagation, while achieving comparable minima. The authors also highlight the potential of SSPNs to model arbitrary region shapes, a significant improvement over prior grammar-based approaches.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a promising idea with strong originality, the lack of convincing experimental validation and clarity in writing undermines its overall impact. The decision to reject is primarily based on (1) insufficient experimental support for the claims and (2) poor clarity in key derivations and explanations.
Supporting Arguments
1. Experimental Validation: 
   - The experimental results are limited and fail to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of SSPNs over competing methods. While the authors claim exponential improvements in parsing time, the results lack comparisons to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods beyond α-expansion and belief propagation. 
   - The evaluation is restricted to a single dataset (Stanford Background Dataset), which is insufficient to generalize the findings. Additionally, the experiments do not explore real-world scenarios where SSPNs might offer a clear advantage.
   - Metrics like pixel accuracy and energy comparison are presented, but there is no discussion of qualitative results (e.g., visualizations of segmentations) or robustness across varying conditions.
2. Writing Clarity:
   - The paper suffers from inaccuracies and confusing explanations, particularly in the derivations of SSPNs and the INFERSSPN algorithm. For example, the description of the hierarchical reasoning process and the role of submodularity in enabling efficient inference is difficult to follow.
   - Key terms like "deep probabilistic model" and "image grammar" are not clearly defined, leading to ambiguity in understanding the contributions.
   - The figures and visualizations are insufficiently explained, and their connection to the text is unclear. For instance, the explanation of the parse tree construction process is convoluted and requires significant clarification.
3. Significance and Impact:
   - While the originality of SSPNs is commendable, the limited experimental validation makes it difficult to assess their practical significance. The claims of exponential improvements in parsing time are promising but remain speculative without broader empirical evidence.
   - The paper does not adequately position SSPNs within the broader literature on semantic segmentation and hierarchical reasoning, leaving readers uncertain about their comparative advantages.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Experimental Enhancements:
   - Include comparisons with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods (e.g., modern deep learning-based approaches like DeepLab or Mask R-CNN).
   - Provide qualitative results, such as visualizations of segmentations, to illustrate the practical benefits of SSPNs.
   - Extend the evaluation to multiple datasets and scenarios to demonstrate generalizability and robustness.
2. Writing and Presentation:
   - Clarify the derivations and definitions of key terms. For example, provide a more intuitive explanation of submodularity and its role in SSPNs.
   - Improve the organization of the paper, ensuring that technical details are accessible to a broader audience. High-level summaries and visual aids could help bridge the gap between theory and implementation.
   - Correct inaccuracies, such as mislabeling optimization methods, and ensure consistency in terminology.
3. Positioning in Literature:
   - Provide a more thorough discussion of related work, highlighting how SSPNs compare to both classical and modern approaches for scene understanding.
   - Discuss potential applications beyond semantic segmentation to emphasize the broader relevance of SSPNs.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do SSPNs compare to modern deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency?
2. Can you provide visualizations of the segmentations produced by SSPNs to better illustrate their practical impact?
3. How sensitive is the performance of SSPNs to the choice of grammar and submodular energy functions? Have you explored alternative formulations?
4. Could you elaborate on the scalability of SSPNs to larger datasets and higher-resolution images?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting extension to SPNs, the lack of rigorous experimental evidence and clarity in presentation limits its impact. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the work for future submissions.
