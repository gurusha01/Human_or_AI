Review of "PGQL: Combining Policy Gradient and Q-Learning"
Summary of Contributions:
This paper introduces PGQL, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that combines policy gradient methods with Q-learning. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the fixed points of regularized policy gradient algorithms and Q-values, showing that the Bellman residual of the induced Q-values is small for small regularization penalties. Leveraging this insight, PGQL incorporates an auxiliary Q-learning update to reduce the Bellman residual, improving data efficiency and stability. Empirical results demonstrate that PGQL outperforms both asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and Q-learning on the Atari benchmark, achieving superior performance in 34 out of 57 games.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Acceptance:
1. Theoretical Contribution: The paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for the connection between value-based methods and policy gradients, formalizing the relationship between softmax-like policies induced by Q-values and regularized policy gradients. This is a significant contribution to the RL literature.
2. Empirical Validation: PGQL demonstrates strong empirical performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods like A3C and Q-learning in the majority of Atari games. The results highlight its improved data efficiency and stability.
3. Novelty and Practicality: The proposed hybrid approach is novel and practically relevant, addressing the limitations of both policy gradient and Q-learning methods by combining their strengths.
Supporting Arguments:
- Theoretical Insights: The derivation of the equivalence between regularized policy gradient methods and advantage function learning is a valuable theoretical contribution. The proof that the Bellman residual converges to zero as regularization decreases strengthens the paper's claims.
- Empirical Results: The experiments on the Atari benchmark are comprehensive, with PGQL achieving the highest median normalized score across games. The inclusion of comparisons with both A3C and Q-learning ensures fairness and robustness of the evaluation.
- Practical Implementation: The paper provides a clear and practical implementation of PGQL, including the use of replay buffers and asynchronous updates, which are critical for real-world applicability.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Presentation Framing: The paper could benefit from framing PGQL as an extension or generalization of the dueling Q-network architecture. This would help contextualize the contributions and highlight the connection to existing methods.
2. Derivation Concern: In Equation (7), the dependency of the expectation on \(\pi\) is overlooked. This could lead to solving a different problem than intended in general cases. The authors should clarify this dependency and discuss its implications.
3. Results Comparison: Adding a direct comparison with the dueling architecture (Wang et al., 2016) would strengthen the empirical results and provide additional context for PGQL's improvements in specific games.
4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper mentions that PGQL underperforms in some games due to potential local optima or overfitting. Including an analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity could provide insights into mitigating these issues.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the dependency of the expectation on \(\pi\) in Equation (7) affect the theoretical guarantees of PGQL? Could this lead to any practical limitations?
2. Can you provide more details on how the weighting parameter \(\eta\) in the PGQL updates was chosen? How sensitive is the algorithm's performance to this parameter?
3. Have you considered testing PGQL on continuous control tasks or other RL benchmarks to evaluate its generalizability beyond Atari games?
Conclusion:
This paper makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to reinforcement learning by bridging policy gradient and Q-learning methods. While there are areas for improvement in presentation and additional comparisons, the novelty, rigor, and practical relevance of PGQL justify its acceptance.
