Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces two novel RNN-based architectures, "Classify" and "Select," for extractive document summarization. The Classify model sequentially determines whether each sentence belongs to the summary, while the Selector model generates sentence indices in an arbitrary order to construct the summary. Both models incorporate interpretable scoring mechanisms that capture salience, redundancy, and other abstract features. The authors evaluate these architectures on the Daily Mail and DUC 2002 datasets, achieving comparable or slightly better results than the state-of-the-art model by Cheng & Lapata (2016). The paper also explores the conditions under which each architecture performs optimally, providing insights into the impact of document structure on summarization performance.
Decision: Reject
Key Reasons:
1. Marginal Contribution: The proposed models offer only minor improvements over existing methods, particularly Cheng & Lapata (2016). The performance gains are inconsistent across datasets and evaluation metrics, making the contribution incremental rather than groundbreaking.
2. Limited Scope: The paper focuses solely on single-document extractive summarization, a relatively saturated area, without exploring more challenging or impactful directions such as abstractive or multi-document summarization.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper demonstrates technical rigor and interpretability in its models, its primary contribution is limited by the narrow scope and modest performance improvements. The reliance on pseudo ground-truth generation, while practical, introduces noise that may hinder the models' effectiveness. Moreover, the need to cap sentence lengths at 50 words raises concerns about scalability to longer or more complex documents. The Selector architecture, despite its novelty, underperforms compared to the Classify model in structured document settings, further limiting its practical utility.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Exploration: The paper could be significantly strengthened by extending its scope to abstractive summarization or multi-document summarization, which are more challenging and impactful tasks.
2. Improved Ground-Truth Generation: The authors should consider more robust methods for generating extractive labels, such as supervised approaches or optimization-based techniques, to reduce noise and improve model performance.
3. Scalability Analysis: Addressing the limitations imposed by the sentence length cap and evaluating the models on datasets with longer documents would enhance the paper's applicability.
4. Performance Gains: The authors should aim for more substantial improvements over existing methods to justify the introduction of new architectures. Incorporating techniques like beam search or more sophisticated training objectives could help achieve this.
5. Selector Architecture: The Selector model's utility could be better demonstrated by applying it to tasks where sentence ordering is less structured, such as multi-document summarization or tweet clustering.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the models change when the sentence length cap is increased or removed? Does this impact training efficiency or model scalability?
2. Have you considered applying the Selector architecture to multi-document summarization or other tasks where sentence order is less critical? If not, why?
3. Could the pseudo ground-truth generation process be improved using more sophisticated methods, such as integer linear programming or supervised learning? What are the trade-offs in doing so?
While the paper provides a solid foundation for further exploration, its incremental contributions and limited scope make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing the above concerns could significantly enhance its impact and relevance.
