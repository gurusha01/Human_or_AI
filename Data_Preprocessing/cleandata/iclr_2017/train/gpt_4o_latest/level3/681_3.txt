Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces an extension to the scattering network framework by incorporating higher-order nonlinearities and invariant dispersion coefficients, aiming to improve signal characterization for machine learning tasks. The authors propose a novel approach to compute the scattering transform entirely in the Fourier domain, achieving linear complexity and leveraging sparsity for efficient computation and storage. The paper validates its approach on a bird song classification task, achieving competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the framework is presented as a scalable, energy-efficient solution for feature extraction, with potential applications in deep learning.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a promising framework and introduces novel contributions, it suffers from significant issues in rigor, clarity, and evaluation. The lack of baseline comparisons, insufficient mathematical grounding, and unclear computational gains undermine the validity of its claims.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Lack of Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare its approach to the scattering transform, which is the most natural baseline. This omission makes it difficult to assess the true performance improvements and contributions of the proposed method.
2. Insufficient Rigor: Key concepts such as the complex modulus and \(\Omega\) are not clearly defined. Claims about higher-order nonlinearity and energy decrease lack formal proofs or detailed explanations. The mathematical grounding is weaker than expected for a signal processing-focused contribution.
3. Unclear Computational Gains: While the paper claims linear complexity and efficient memory management, it does not provide sufficient empirical evidence or comparative benchmarks to substantiate these claims. The computational improvements over existing methods remain ambiguous.
4. Excessive Length and Redundancy: The paper is overly verbose, with lengthy descriptions that do not add significant value. For example, the derivation of sparse Fourier filters and the explanation of sparsity could be condensed without losing clarity.
5. Issues with Figures and Definitions: Figure 4, which presents results on the bird dataset, lacks clarity and does not effectively communicate the findings. Additionally, the wavelet used is incorrectly labeled as a Morlet wavelet, which raises concerns about the accuracy of the implementation.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Baseline Comparisons: Include a thorough comparison with the scattering transform and other relevant baselines to contextualize the contributions. This should include both computational and classification performance metrics.
2. Mathematical Rigor: Provide formal proofs or detailed explanations for claims about higher-order nonlinearity, energy decrease, and sparsity. Ensure that all key terms are clearly defined and supported by references.
3. Clarity and Conciseness: Reduce the length of the paper by eliminating redundant explanations and focusing on the core contributions. For instance, the derivation of Fourier-domain operations can be summarized more succinctly.
4. Improved Figures: Revise Figure 4 to include clearer labels and a ratio-based representation. Ensure that all figures are self-explanatory and directly support the claims made in the text.
5. Numerical Analysis: Conduct a numerical analysis to evaluate the impact of higher-order nonlinearity on variance and SNR. This would strengthen the motivation for its inclusion.
6. Relevance of Permutation Invariance: Reassess the relevance of permutation as a variability factor and clarify its role in the proposed framework.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to the scattering transform in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency? Can you provide quantitative benchmarks?
2. What is the rationale for using a quadratic nonlinearity, and how does it affect the variance and sparsity of the representations compared to the complex modulus?
3. Can you clarify the choice of parameters for the wavelet filters and their impact on the results? Why was the wavelet incorrectly labeled as a Morlet wavelet?
4. How does the framework handle noise and class imbalance in the bird song dataset? Are there any preprocessing steps that could improve performance?
While the paper introduces innovative ideas, addressing the above concerns is essential to improve its scientific rigor and impact.
