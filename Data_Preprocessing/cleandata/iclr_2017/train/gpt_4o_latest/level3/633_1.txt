Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel cooperative training algorithm, termed CoopNets, that integrates energy-based models (descriptor networks) and generator networks for mutual enhancement. The descriptor network revises the generator's samples using Langevin dynamics, while the generator learns from these revised samples to improve its synthesis capabilities. The paper claims that this cooperative interaction stabilizes training, improves sample quality, and facilitates simultaneous learning of both networks. The authors provide theoretical insights into the convergence of the proposed algorithm and present experimental results on image synthesis, reconstruction, and inpainting tasks.
Decision: Reject
While the paper proposes an innovative idea with potential, the experimental results and analysis fail to convincingly demonstrate the claimed benefits of the CoopNets framework. Key issues include insufficient quantitative evidence, outdated comparisons, and concerns about the soundness of convergence analysis.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Experimental Weaknesses: The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed architecture. For example, the face completion task lacks a clear comparison to state-of-the-art methods like Kim & Bengio (2016), which is critical given the similarity in problem settings. The qualitative results, while visually appealing, are insufficient to substantiate the claims without robust quantitative metrics.
   
2. Missing Quantitative Analysis: The paper does not provide a thorough quantitative analysis of the benefits of using generator initialization for descriptor inference. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the actual impact of the proposed cooperative training mechanism.
3. Convergence Concerns: The convergence analysis relies on biased Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) with a fixed step size, which raises questions about the theoretical soundness. This issue is particularly concerning given the reliance on Langevin dynamics for both descriptor and generator training.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Stronger Baselines: Include comparisons with more relevant and recent models, such as Kim & Bengio (2016), to contextualize the performance of CoopNets. This will help establish the competitive edge of the proposed method.
   
2. Quantitative Metrics: Provide detailed quantitative evaluations of the cooperative mechanism's benefits, particularly the impact of generator initialization on descriptor performance. Metrics such as FID or reconstruction error would strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Convergence Analysis: Address the theoretical concerns regarding biased SGLD sampling. Consider using adaptive step sizes or other methods to mitigate bias and improve the robustness of convergence guarantees.
4. Clarifications: Provide additional details on the derivation of Equation 8, especially regarding the dependency of \( p(x|y) \) on \( W_G \). This will improve the paper's clarity and accessibility.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide quantitative evidence to demonstrate the specific benefits of initializing descriptor inference with generator samples? How does this compare to random initialization or other baselines?
2. Why were comparisons to Kim & Bengio (2016) omitted, given the similarity in problem settings? How does CoopNets perform relative to their method?
3. How does the fixed step size in Langevin dynamics affect the convergence of CoopNets, and how do you address potential biases introduced by this choice?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting idea with potential, the lack of rigorous experimental validation and theoretical clarity undermines its contributions. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the work.
