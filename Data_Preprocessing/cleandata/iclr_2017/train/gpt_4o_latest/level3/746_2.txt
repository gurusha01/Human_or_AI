Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel framework for learning algorithmic tasks using the "divide and conquer" paradigm, leveraging recursive neural architectures for splitting and merging inputs. The authors propose a differentiable approach that optimizes not only for accuracy but also for computational complexity, using weak supervision (input-output pairs) without requiring intermediate labels. The framework is tested on sorting and planar convex hull tasks, demonstrating the potential of scale-invariant architectures to generalize across input sizes. Key contributions include reasoning about program complexity and a partially trainable implementation of the divide-and-conquer principle.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting idea and a promising direction, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are: (1) the lack of generalizability of the proposed method, which relies heavily on task-specific engineering, and (2) the unclear exposition of the approach, which mixes high-level concepts with low-level implementation details, making it difficult to follow. These issues undermine the broader applicability and clarity of the work.
Supporting Arguments
1. Specific Problem Tackled: The paper addresses the problem of learning algorithmic tasks using divide-and-conquer principles. While this is a meaningful and underexplored area, the paper's focus on sorting and convex hull tasks feels narrow and proof-of-concept-like. The lack of generalizability to other tasks limits its impact.
   
2. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-motivated in its attempt to incorporate complexity as a training objective and draws connections to related work in neural program synthesis and dynamic programming. However, it overpromises generality without demonstrating applicability beyond the two chosen tasks.
3. Support for Claims: The empirical results are preliminary and lack sufficient rigor. While the authors claim that their method generalizes well to larger input sizes, the experiments are limited in scope and fail to provide robust comparisons with baseline methods. Additionally, the theoretical reasoning about complexity is not fully substantiated by the results.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity and Organization: The paper would benefit from separating high-level ideas from low-level implementation details. For instance, the split and merge operations should be described conceptually first, with implementation details relegated to an appendix. Clearly stating the challenges and how the proposed method addresses them would improve readability.
2. Generalizability: The method's reliance on task-specific engineering should be addressed. Demonstrating applicability to a broader range of algorithmic tasks (e.g., graph problems, NP-hard tasks) would strengthen the paper's claims of generality.
3. Empirical Rigor: The experiments should include comparisons with standard baselines (e.g., attention mechanisms, pointer networks) to contextualize the performance of the proposed method. Additionally, ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the split and merge components would be valuable.
4. Future Directions: While the authors outline future work, they should provide more concrete steps for addressing the limitations of the current implementation, such as joint training of split and merge operations and extending the framework to graph-based tasks.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can the proposed method be applied to tasks beyond sorting and convex hulls without significant task-specific modifications? If so, could you provide examples or preliminary results?
2. How does the performance of your method compare to existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and complexity? Have you considered using benchmarks from neural program synthesis?
3. Could you clarify how the regularization terms (e.g., βS and βM) were chosen and their impact on the results? Would the method still perform well with different hyperparameter settings?
In summary, while the paper introduces an intriguing approach to learning algorithmic tasks, its lack of generalizability, unclear exposition, and insufficient empirical validation prevent it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this time. Addressing these issues could make the work a valuable contribution to the field.
