Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel prediction difference analysis method for visualizing the decision-making process of deep neural networks (DNNs), with applications to both natural and medical images. The method highlights regions in an input image that contribute evidence for or against a specific classification, improving interpretability of DNNs. The authors propose three key advancements: conditional sampling, multivariate analysis, and deep visualization of hidden layers. These enhancements address limitations in prior methods and provide more refined and meaningful visualizations. The paper demonstrates the method's utility on ImageNet data and MRI scans, emphasizing its potential in critical domains like healthcare.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting and well-written approach with valuable applications, it has significant limitations that undermine its practical impact. The primary reasons for rejection are the unclear explanation of key insights and the computational inefficiency of the method, which limits its scalability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The proposed method is innovative and addresses an important problem: making DNNs interpretable, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine.
   - Conditional sampling and multivariate analysis improve upon previous visualization techniques, producing more fine-grained and contextually relevant results.
   - The application to medical imaging is compelling, as interpretability is crucial for clinical adoption of AI systems.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Assumption of Translation Invariance: The method assumes translation invariance in images, which is a significant limitation. Global context often plays a crucial role in pixel semantics, especially in medical images where spatial relationships are critical. The authors should empirically validate this assumption or propose modifications to address it.
   - Computational Expense: The method requires 30 minutes per image for GoogLeNet, making it impractical for large datasets or real-time applications. This severely limits its usability in clinical or industrial settings.
   - Unclear Insights: The explanation of the softmax transformation in Figure 7 is unclear. The authors fail to adequately describe how the visualizations differ between the penultimate and output layers, leaving the reader uncertain about the significance of this result.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Addressing Translation Invariance: The authors should explore methods to incorporate global context into their approach. For instance, using hierarchical or multi-scale models might mitigate this limitation.
2. Improving Computational Efficiency: The authors should investigate optimization techniques, such as leveraging more efficient sampling methods or hardware acceleration, to reduce runtime.
3. Clarifying Figure 7: The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between visualizations in the penultimate and output layers, supported by additional examples or quantitative metrics.
4. Broader Validation: The method should be tested on larger and more diverse datasets to demonstrate its generalizability and robustness.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the assumption of translation invariance affect the method's performance on datasets where global context is critical, such as medical images?
2. Can the computational cost be reduced without sacrificing the quality of the visualizations? Have you explored alternative sampling strategies or hardware optimizations?
3. Could you provide more detailed insights into the results shown in Figure 7? How do the visualizations differ between the penultimate and output layers, and why is this distinction important?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an important problem and proposes interesting solutions, the limitations in scalability, clarity, and assumptions prevent it from being ready for acceptance. With further refinements, this work has the potential to make a significant impact.
