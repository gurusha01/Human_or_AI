Review
The paper introduces the concept of linear classifier probes as a tool to better understand the representational power of intermediate layers in neural networks. The authors propose using these probes to analyze the dynamics of deep models during and after training, offering insights into layer-specific roles and potential design improvements. The paper demonstrates the use of probes on toy models, MNIST convolutional networks, and briefly on the Inception v3 model. The authors argue that this method provides a novel perspective on network interpretability and can help diagnose issues in model design, such as the impact of auxiliary losses or skip connections.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of sufficient novelty and the underdeveloped nature of the proposed method. While the idea of using linear classifier probes is intriguing and has potential, the paper does not present compelling evidence that this approach significantly advances the state of the art. Additionally, the experiments are limited to toy models and small-scale networks, with only minimal exploration of competitive, real-world architectures like Inception v3. This undermines the paper's claims of practical utility for network design.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Motivation and Novelty: The paper tackles an important problem—understanding the representational dynamics of neural networks—but the proposed method is not sufficiently novel. The idea of using probes to analyze layers is conceptually similar to existing work on layer-wise interpretability and auxiliary losses. The paper does not clearly differentiate its approach from prior methods or demonstrate a unique theoretical contribution.
2. Empirical Evidence: The experiments are primarily conducted on toy models and MNIST, which are insufficient to establish the method's utility in real-world scenarios. The limited results on Inception v3 are incomplete and do not convincingly show how the method scales to large, competitive networks. This raises doubts about the method's practical applicability.
3. Scientific Rigor: While the paper provides some theoretical grounding and experimental results, the claims are not fully supported. For example, the authors suggest that probes can guide network design, but there is no concrete evidence or case study demonstrating improved architectures as a result of using probes.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experiments: Conduct experiments on more competitive and diverse datasets and architectures, such as ImageNet and state-of-the-art models. This would strengthen the paper's claims of practical relevance.
2. Clarify Novelty: Clearly articulate how the proposed method differs from and improves upon existing techniques. For instance, compare the probes to other interpretability methods quantitatively and qualitatively.
3. Demonstrate Utility: Provide concrete examples of how the proposed method can lead to better network designs or insights. For instance, show how probes can identify and resolve specific design flaws in large-scale models.
4. Address Computational Challenges: The paper acknowledges the computational overhead of probes, especially in large models. Proposing efficient alternatives or optimizations (e.g., multi-layer probes or feature subset selection) would enhance the method's feasibility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to existing interpretability techniques, such as saliency maps or layer-wise relevance propagation, in terms of insights provided?
2. Can you provide a detailed case study where probes led to a demonstrable improvement in model performance or design?
3. How do you address the computational challenges of using probes in large-scale networks, especially when the number of features is prohibitively large?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an important problem and introduces a promising idea, it falls short in terms of novelty, empirical validation, and practical impact. Further development and experimentation are needed to make the method more compelling and applicable to real-world scenarios.
