The paper presents a novel approach to sensorimotor control in immersive 3D environments, leveraging supervised learning to predict low-dimensional measurements (e.g., health, ammo) conditioned on goals and actions. This departs from traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods by avoiding temporal-difference (TD) updates and scalar rewards, instead using dense, vectorial feedback from the environment. The proposed algorithm, Direct Future Prediction (DFP), outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods in challenging tasks, including winning the Visual Doom AI competition. Key contributions include Monte Carlo estimation, goal parameterization, and empirical evidence of generalization across environments and goals.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Acceptance:
1. Novelty and Generalization: The paper introduces a supervised learning-based approach to sensorimotor control, which generalizes effectively across dynamically changing goals and unseen environments. This is a significant departure from conventional RL methods, offering a fresh perspective on goal-directed behavior.
2. Empirical Strength: The algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both controlled experiments and real-world benchmarks, such as the Visual Doom AI competition. The results are compelling and scientifically rigorous, with extensive comparisons to prior work.
Supporting Arguments:
- The approach is well-motivated and grounded in literature, addressing key challenges in RL, such as sparse rewards and generalization. The use of dense, multivariate feedback aligns with biological learning principles, enhancing training stability and efficiency.
- The empirical results are robust, showing clear advantages over baselines like DQN, A3C, and DSR in complex tasks. The ablation study further validates the importance of vectorial feedback and multi-step predictions.
- The ability to adapt to new goals without retraining is a critical advancement, demonstrated convincingly in the experiments.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. On-Policy Assumption: The paper mentions the use of a replay buffer, which introduces off-policy elements in training. A discussion on how this affects convergence and stability would strengthen the methodology section.
2. Metadata Limitations: The approach relies on low-dimensional measurements (e.g., health, ammo). Clarifying how the algorithm performs in environments lacking such metadata or with noisy measurements would improve its applicability.
3. Memory and Temporal Abstraction: While the paper acknowledges the lack of memory and hierarchical skills, discussing potential integration with recurrent architectures or temporal abstraction methods could provide a roadmap for future work.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the algorithm handle environments where low-dimensional measurements are unavailable or unreliable? Can the approach be extended to infer such measurements from raw sensory input?
2. What are the computational trade-offs of using supervised learning over TD-based methods in terms of sample efficiency and scalability to larger action spaces?
3. Could the proposed architecture be adapted for continuous action spaces, and how would this impact its performance?
In summary, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of sensorimotor control, offering a novel and effective alternative to traditional RL approaches. With minor clarifications and extensions, it has the potential to inspire further research in goal-directed learning and generalization.
