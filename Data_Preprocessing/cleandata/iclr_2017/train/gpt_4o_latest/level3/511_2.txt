Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel algorithm for approximating solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE) using neural networks. The authors frame the problem as a recursive regression task, where the neural network serves dual roles as a function approximator and a data generator. The proposed approach aims to address the curse of dimensionality inherent in traditional gridding techniques and demonstrates its applicability through several 2D toy examples and one 3D example. The paper highlights the memory efficiency of the neural network-based approach compared to gridding methods and provides experimental results to validate its claims. The authors also discuss the potential for scaling the method to higher-dimensional problems, which could have significant implications for control theory and safety-critical systems.
Decision: Reject  
Key Reasons:  
1. Insufficient Addressing of Known Challenges: The paper does not address the critical issue of the lack of correlation between small PDE residuals and well-performing policies, which is a well-documented challenge in this domain. This omission undermines the scientific rigor of the approach.  
2. Limited Demonstration of Scalability: The experiments are restricted to low-dimensional (2D and one 3D) toy examples, which are insufficient to demonstrate the practical utility or scalability of the method to real-world, high-dimensional problems.  
Supporting Arguments
1. While the paper introduces a creative approach to approximating HJI PDEs, it does not adequately engage with existing literature. Key prior works, such as those addressing the relationship between PDE residuals and policy performance, are not cited. This lack of contextualization weakens the paper's contribution and makes it difficult to assess its novelty.  
2. The experimental validation is limited to simple examples, which do not convincingly demonstrate the method's ability to handle the complexities of real-world control problems. For example, the pursuit-evasion games are overly simplified, and the results do not provide insights into how the method would perform in higher-dimensional or more challenging scenarios.  
3. The paper contains several typographical errors (e.g., "Range-Kutta" instead of "Runge-Kutta"), which detract from its professionalism and polish.  
Additional Feedback
1. Alignment with Conference Scope: The submission is misaligned with ICLR's focus on learned representations and machine learning. The work would be better suited for venues like ACC, ADPRL, or CDC, where control theory and PDE approximations are central themes.  
2. Clarity and Rigor: The paper would benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding its reliance on toy examples and the challenges of extending it to higher dimensions.  
3. Experimental Design: To strengthen the paper, the authors should include experiments on higher-dimensional problems and compare their method against state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers. Additionally, the use of real-world control problems would enhance the practical relevance of the work.  
4. Typographical Errors: The authors should carefully proofread the paper to fix typographical errors and improve readability.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method address the lack of correlation between small PDE residuals and well-performing policies? Can you provide evidence or theoretical justification for why your approach mitigates this issue?  
2. Have you considered testing your method on higher-dimensional problems or real-world control scenarios? If not, what are the anticipated challenges in scaling your approach?  
3. How does your method compare quantitatively and qualitatively to existing neural PDE solvers in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability?  
In summary, while the paper explores an interesting direction, it falls short in addressing key challenges, demonstrating scalability, and situating itself within the broader literature. These issues, combined with its misalignment with ICLR's focus, lead to the recommendation for rejection. However, the reviewer encourages the authors to refine their work and submit it to a more appropriate venue, as the research direction has potential for impactful contributions to control theory and safety-critical systems.
