Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions  
The paper introduces Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA), a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation in time-series data. VRADA combines Variational Recurrent Neural Networks (VRNN) with Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to learn domain-invariant representations while capturing temporal latent dependencies. This is a significant contribution, as it addresses the limitations of existing domain adaptation methods that fail to model the temporal structure of sequential data. The authors demonstrate VRADA's superiority over baseline methods, including DANN, R-DANN, and Variational Fair Autoencoder (VFAE), on real-world healthcare datasets. The inclusion of reconstruction loss and adversarial training at the latent representation level further strengthens the model's ability to transfer knowledge across domains.
Decision: Accept  
The paper makes a compelling case for acceptance due to its novel combination of VRNN and adversarial training, which provides a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation for time-series data. The empirical results are robust, showing consistent performance gains across multiple datasets and tasks. Additionally, the paper is well-motivated, and the proposed method is grounded in both theoretical and empirical rigor.
Supporting Arguments  
1. Novelty and Motivation: The integration of VRNN with adversarial domain adaptation is novel and addresses a critical gap in the literature by explicitly modeling temporal latent dependencies. This is particularly relevant for applications like healthcare, where time-series data is prevalent.  
2. Empirical Validation: The results convincingly demonstrate that VRADA outperforms baselines (DANN, R-DANN, VFAE) on multiple tasks, including mortality prediction and ICD9 code classification. The improvements in AUC scores and the stability of the model's performance are noteworthy.  
3. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides a clear mathematical formulation of VRADA, and the experiments are well-designed with appropriate baselines, hyperparameter tuning, and ablation studies. The inclusion of visualizations (e.g., t-SNE plots, activation patterns) strengthens the claims about the model's ability to learn domain-invariant representations.
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Comparison with MMD-based Methods: Since VFAE, which uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) regularization, performs well, it would be interesting to explore a variant of VRADA that incorporates MMD instead of adversarial training. This could provide additional insights into the relative strengths of these approaches.  
2. Analysis of Performance Gains: While the paper highlights the differences between VRADA and R-DANN (e.g., use of VRNN and reconstruction loss), a deeper analysis is needed to pinpoint the exact sources of performance improvement. For instance, how much does the reconstruction loss contribute compared to the adversarial training?  
3. Generalization to Other Domains: The experiments focus on healthcare datasets. It would be valuable to test VRADA on other types of time-series data (e.g., financial or sensor data) to demonstrate its generalizability.  
4. Computational Complexity: The paper does not discuss the computational overhead introduced by VRNN and adversarial training. A comparison of training times and resource requirements with simpler baselines would provide a more complete evaluation.
Questions for the Authors  
1. How does VRADA perform when the target domain has extremely limited data? Are there any strategies to further improve performance in such scenarios?  
2. Could the authors provide more details on the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the trade-off parameter Î» in the objective function?  
3. Have the authors considered using alternative divergence measures (e.g., Wasserstein distance) for domain adaptation instead of adversarial training?  
Overall, the paper is a strong contribution to the field of domain adaptation for sequential data, and I recommend its acceptance with minor revisions to address the points raised above.
