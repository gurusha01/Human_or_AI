Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates various vocabulary selection strategies to improve the computational efficiency of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. The authors evaluate methods ranging from simple word co-occurrence counts to more advanced techniques such as bilingual embeddings, word alignments, phrase pairs, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The paper extends prior work (e.g., Mi et al., 2016) by conducting a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy across different selection strategies. The experiments, conducted on WMT15 English-German and WMT16 English-Romanian datasets, demonstrate significant speed-ups in decoding (up to 90%) and moderate improvements in training efficiency (up to 25%) with minimal impact on translation accuracy. The results are practically relevant, as they show that word alignment-based selection achieves high coverage of the full-vocabulary model while maintaining competitive BLEU scores.
Decision: Reject
While the paper provides a thorough empirical analysis and offers practical insights, I recommend rejection for the following reasons:
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper primarily builds on existing methods (e.g., Mi et al., 2016) and does not introduce fundamentally new techniques or theoretical contributions. The methods explored, such as word co-occurrences, bilingual embeddings, and SVMs, are well-known in the literature.
2. Limited Scope in Training Experiments: The analysis of vocabulary selection during training (Section 4.3) is underdeveloped. The experiments focus primarily on decoding efficiency, leaving the potential impact of vocabulary selection on training generalization and rare word handling insufficiently explored.
Supporting Arguments
1. Empirical Rigor and Practical Relevance: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple datasets, selection strategies, and evaluation metrics. The results are well-documented and demonstrate clear trade-offs between speed and accuracy. For practitioners, the findings on word alignment-based selection are particularly valuable.
2. Incremental Contribution: Despite the solid empirical work, the paper does not significantly advance the state of the art. The techniques explored are incremental extensions of prior work, and the novelty lies mainly in the breadth of the empirical analysis rather than in methodological innovation.
3. Training Analysis: The limited experiments on training efficiency and generalization are a missed opportunity. For example, the impact of vocabulary selection on rare word learning and long-term training dynamics could have been explored further.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Training Experiments: Investigate the effects of vocabulary selection on rare word generalization, convergence rates, and the quality of learned embeddings. Additionally, explore whether selection strategies can be dynamically adapted during training to balance efficiency and accuracy.
2. Clarify Methodological Details: In Section 2.1, it is unclear whether smoothing was applied to the word co-occurrence measure. This should be clarified to ensure reproducibility.
3. Enhance Novelty: Consider proposing new selection strategies or combining existing ones in novel ways. For example, integrating neural attention mechanisms with vocabulary selection could provide a more dynamic and context-aware approach.
4. Broaden Evaluation: Include additional language pairs and larger datasets to validate the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, consider evaluating the methods on low-resource languages, where vocabulary selection could have a more pronounced impact.
Questions for the Authors
1. Was smoothing applied to the word co-occurrence measure in Section 2.1? If so, what method was used, and how did it affect the results?
2. Did you experiment with dynamically adjusting the vocabulary size during training or decoding? If not, could this be a potential avenue for future work?
3. How do the proposed methods perform on low-resource language pairs or domains with highly specialized vocabularies?
In conclusion, while the paper is well-executed and practically useful, the lack of novelty and limited exploration of training dynamics prevent it from making a significant contribution to the field. Addressing these issues in future work could strengthen the impact of the research.
