Review
Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to learning visual servoing by combining pre-trained visual features, a bilinear dynamics model, and reinforcement learning. The authors propose a Q-iteration-based method for servoing in the space of learned visual features, rather than raw image pixels or manually designed keypoints. A bilinear dynamics model predicts next-frame features based on the current frame and action, while a fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithm learns a Q-function that weights feature channels to prioritize task-relevant features. The method demonstrates sample efficiency and robustness to visual variations, achieving significant improvements over conventional approaches in a synthetic car-following benchmark.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a technically novel and well-motivated approach, the experimental validation is insufficient to justify its claims. The limited scope of experiments, lack of comparisons with alternative architectures and iterative Q-learning methods, and reliance on toy simulations detract from the paper's overall impact.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The bilinear dynamics model strikes a balance between computational efficiency and expressiveness, enabling effective frame prediction.
   - The channel-weighting approach for feature prioritization is experimentally validated and effectively captures object importance.
   - The optimization scheme for Bellman error is novel and computationally efficient, leveraging parameter scaling for fitted Q-iteration.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The experimental results are limited to small-scale synthetic simulations, with no evaluation on real-world benchmarks or diverse tasks. This undermines the generalizability of the approach.
   - The modified VGG architecture is not compared against the original version or other feature extraction backbones, leaving questions about the necessity of the modifications.
   - There is no comparison between FQI and iterative approaches that fix the second term in the Bellman error equation (Eq. 5), which could provide insights into the advantages of the proposed optimization scheme.
   - The paper does not explore the trade-offs between fully connected, convolutional, and locally connected dynamics models, which is critical for understanding the design choices.
Additional Feedback
1. Experimental Scope: Expanding the experiments to include real-world datasets and tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation or navigation) would significantly strengthen the paper. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in these domains are essential.
2. Architecture Validation: Provide ablation studies to justify the modifications to the VGG network. Additionally, compare the performance of other feature extraction backbones (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to demonstrate the robustness of the approach.
3. Iterative Q-Learning: Include comparisons with iterative Q-learning methods that fix the second term in Eq. 5 to highlight the advantages of the proposed FQI scheme.
4. Scalability: Address the scalability of the method to higher-dimensional control spaces and more complex environments. This could involve larger-scale simulations or hardware experiments.
5. Clarity: While the technical content is solid, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of key equations and algorithms, particularly for readers less familiar with reinforcement learning.
Questions for Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on real-world tasks or benchmarks? Are there plans to validate the approach on physical robots or real-world datasets?
2. Why was the VGG architecture chosen, and how do the modifications improve performance compared to the original version or other architectures?
3. Can the bilinear dynamics model handle more complex, non-linear dynamics, or would additional modeling complexity be required for such scenarios?
4. How does the proposed FQI algorithm compare to iterative Q-learning methods in terms of convergence speed and performance?
In conclusion, while the paper demonstrates technical novelty and a well-motivated problem formulation, the experimental limitations and lack of broader validation prevent it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this time. Addressing the outlined weaknesses could make this work a strong contribution to the field.
