Review of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel architecture for solving inverse problems in computer vision, combining a generator, renderer, and adversarial prior. The key innovation lies in the adversarial prior, which employs a memory-based fully convolutional loss to align local image statistics. The model is applied to three tasks—image in-painting, intrinsic image decomposition, and figure-ground layer extraction—using weak supervision without paired annotations. While the approach is conceptually intriguing and leverages unlabelled data effectively, several issues limit the paper's impact.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are (1) the lack of experimental validation on challenging, real-world datasets, which undermines the practical significance of the proposed method, and (2) clarity issues in the explanation of key components, such as the memory retrieval engine and the adversarial prior.
Supporting Arguments
1. Experimental Validation: The experiments are conducted on toy datasets (e.g., MNIST for in-painting, synthetic datasets for intrinsic decomposition and figure-ground extraction). While these setups demonstrate proof-of-concept, they fail to establish the model's robustness and generalizability to real-world, state-of-the-art datasets. For example, tasks like image in-painting are well-studied, and the use of MNIST does not provide meaningful insights into the model's performance on complex, natural images.
2. Memory Retrieval Engine: The reliance on L2 pixel distance for memory retrieval raises concerns about scalability and generalizability. L2 distance is sensitive to pixel-level variations and may not perform well on diverse or high-dimensional datasets. This limitation is not adequately addressed in the paper.
3. Clarity Issues: The terminology used (e.g., "imagination" and "memory") is vague and lacks precise definitions. The memory retrieval process, a critical component of the model, is not explained with sufficient detail, leaving the reader uncertain about its implementation and effectiveness.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Real-World Validation: Extend the experiments to include challenging datasets such as ImageNet for in-painting or real-world intrinsic decomposition benchmarks. This would significantly strengthen the paper's claims about the model's practical utility.
2. Feature Space Illustration: Include visualizations of the feature space to clarify how the adversarial prior and memory retrieval engine operate. This would align the paper with best practices in related works.
3. Clarify Terminology: Provide precise definitions for terms like "imagination" and "memory." Additionally, elaborate on the memory retrieval process, including its computational complexity and potential limitations.
4. Generalization of Memory Retrieval: Explore alternative retrieval mechanisms, such as feature-based similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity in a learned embedding space), to address the limitations of L2 distance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform when the memory database contains significant domain shifts from the input images? Have you tested the robustness of the memory retrieval engine in such scenarios?
2. Can you provide quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets for the tasks considered?
3. How scalable is the memory retrieval engine when applied to large-scale datasets, and what are the computational implications?
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting approach to inverse problems using weak supervision, the lack of rigorous experimental validation and clarity in key components limits its contribution. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
