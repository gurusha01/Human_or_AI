Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper addresses the problem of visual servoing by leveraging learned visual representations and predictive dynamics models. It introduces an action-conditional bilinear model based on pre-trained VGG features, which is further enhanced with a multi-scale, multi-channel, locally-connected variant for improved dynamics prediction. To overcome the limitations of one-step prediction, the authors propose a weighted objective that incorporates long-term policy values, evaluated using a fitted-value approach. A novel trust-region fitted-Q iteration algorithm is introduced to optimize the Q-function, enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in generalization, robustness to visual variations, and sample efficiency compared to conventional methods. The paper is mathematically rigorous, well-written, and provides valuable insights for robotics researchers.
Decision: Reject
While the paper makes notable contributions to visual servoing, its focus on control and fixed policy representation over end-to-end representation learning limits its alignment with the scope of ICLR, which emphasizes advances in representation learning. The reliance on pre-trained features and a linear value approximation reduces the novelty in terms of representation learning, which is central to this conference.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The use of pre-trained VGG features for visual servoing is well-motivated and demonstrates strong empirical results, including robustness to occlusions and visual variations.
   - The introduction of a trust-region fitted-Q iteration algorithm is a novel and valuable contribution, particularly for sample-efficient reinforcement learning in robotics.
   - The paper provides a thorough evaluation, including comparisons to classical visual servoing methods and end-to-end reinforcement learning approaches, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The paper's primary focus is on control and predictive dynamics rather than advancing representation learning. The use of fixed pre-trained features limits the exploration of learning representations specific to the task.
   - The linear value approximation and fixed policy representation reduce the end-to-end learning aspect, which is a key focus of ICLR.
   - While the empirical results are strong, the reliance on pre-trained features raises questions about the generalizability of the approach to scenarios where such features may not be readily available or suitable.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Scope: To better align with ICLR, the paper could explore end-to-end learning of visual representations tailored to the servoing task, rather than relying on pre-trained features.
2. Representation Learning: Investigate methods to jointly optimize the feature representation and control policy, potentially using unsupervised or self-supervised learning techniques.
3. Generalization: Provide additional experiments to demonstrate the applicability of the approach to tasks where pre-trained features are unavailable or less effective.
4. Ablation Studies: Include more detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the multi-scale bilinear model, the weighted objective, and the trust-region fitted-Q iteration algorithm.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the proposed method compare when using features learned end-to-end versus pre-trained VGG features? Could this bridge the gap in representation learning?
2. Can the trust-region fitted-Q iteration algorithm be adapted to scenarios where pre-trained features are unavailable or where task-specific features need to be learned?
3. How does the method handle scenarios with highly dynamic or cluttered environments, where pre-trained features may fail to generalize?
While the paper is a strong contribution to robotics and control, its limited focus on representation learning makes it less suited for ICLR. Addressing the above concerns could significantly enhance its relevance to the conference.
