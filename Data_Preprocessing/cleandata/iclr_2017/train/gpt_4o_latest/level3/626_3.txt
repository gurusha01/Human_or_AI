Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper explores the concept of preimages in deep rectifier networks, presenting a theoretical framework for computing the set of inputs that result in the same node activity at any level of the network. The authors argue that understanding these preimages is critical for analyzing class mixing and disentangling class manifolds, which are essential for efficient classification. The work provides a procedure for computing preimages by disregarding pooling effects and demonstrates that these preimages form piecewise linear manifolds in the input space. The authors suggest that this understanding could lead to better training algorithms and improved network efficiency. The paper also briefly discusses implications for convolutional networks and the potential connection between preimages and adversarial examples.
Decision: Reject
The paper is not ready for acceptance due to the following reasons:
1. Unclear Results and Utility: While the theoretical framework is intriguing, the results are not clearly presented, and the practical utility of the preimage construction remains ambiguous.
2. Incomplete Development: The approach, though promising, is not sufficiently developed to provide actionable insights into the underlying mechanisms of deep networks or their practical implications.
Supporting Arguments
1. Unclear Results: The paper lacks empirical validation or concrete examples that demonstrate the utility of the proposed preimage computation in real-world scenarios. While the authors claim that preimages could help avoid class mixing and improve training efficiency, these claims are not substantiated with experimental evidence or rigorous analysis.
2. Limited Practical Relevance: The work focuses heavily on the theoretical capabilities of ReLU models but does not address how these insights translate into practical improvements for deep learning tasks. For instance, the discussion on convolutional networks is largely heuristic and lacks depth.
3. Ambiguity in Utility: The paper does not convincingly argue why computing preimages is necessary or how it would lead to impactful outcomes. The connection between preimages and adversarial examples, for instance, is mentioned but not explored in detail.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Empirical Validation: Include experiments to compute preimages for real-world datasets and demonstrate their relevance to classification tasks. For example, show how preimages can be used to improve class separability or reduce adversarial vulnerability.
2. Clarify Practical Implications: Provide a more detailed discussion on how the theoretical insights can be applied to practical problems, such as training efficiency or robustness to adversarial attacks.
3. Address Pooling Effects: The paper explicitly disregards pooling, which is a critical component of many deep networks. Future work should incorporate pooling into the analysis to make the findings more broadly applicable.
4. Expand on Convolutional Networks: The section on convolutional networks is underdeveloped. A more rigorous analysis of how preimages behave in convolutional architectures would strengthen the paper.
5. Explain Utility of Preimage Construction: The authors should clearly articulate why computing preimages is a valuable endeavor and provide concrete examples or applications where this knowledge can make a tangible difference.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed preimage computation method perform empirically on real-world datasets? Can you provide examples where preimages have been computed and used to improve classification performance?
2. How do you plan to incorporate pooling effects into the preimage computation framework, and what challenges do you anticipate in doing so?
3. Can you elaborate on the connection between preimages and adversarial examples? Are there specific experiments or analyses planned to explore this relationship?
4. How does the proposed framework scale to deeper networks with larger input dimensions and more complex architectures?
In conclusion, while the paper explores an interesting theoretical direction, it requires significant refinement and empirical validation to establish its utility and impact.
