Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper investigates the universality property of halting times in optimization algorithms, extending prior work to include spin-glass models and gradient descent in deep learning. Universality is defined as the halting time fluctuations being independent of parameters like target accuracy (epsilon), problem dimension (N), or ensemble distribution (E), depending only on the algorithm. The authors present empirical evidence of universality in well-performing algorithms, introduce a moment-based indicator to assess universality, and classify halting time distributions into Gumbel-like and Gaussian-like categories. The work highlights the potential benefits of universality as a measure of algorithmic stability and performance, while also identifying cases where universality fails. The paper aims to provide insights into the connection between universality, algorithm performance, and the structure of optimization landscapes.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons: (1) the lack of rigorous validation for the claims of universality, and (2) incomplete experimental testing of key parameters (epsilon and N), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions.
Supporting Arguments
1. Insufficient Validation of Claims: While the paper provides empirical evidence for universality, the results are limited in scope. The authors fail to rigorously justify why universality is a desirable property of numerical methods, and the argument that it correlates with high performance is speculative and not well-supported. The conclusion overstates the validation of universality, given the limited experimental evidence.
   
2. Incomplete Testing of Parameters: The experiments focus solely on varying the ensemble distribution (E) while leaving epsilon and N untested. Since universality is defined as independence from all three parameters, this omission significantly weakens the claims. The dependence of epsilon on N is particularly problematic and raises concerns about the validity of the results.
3. Ambiguity in Definitions: The definitions of key terms like algorithm (A) and ensemble (E) are unclear, especially in the context of optimization problems with unknown functional forms. This ambiguity makes it difficult to generalize the findings or replicate the experiments.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Scope: Test the universality property across all relevant parameters (epsilon, N, and E) to provide a more comprehensive validation. Address the epsilon-N dependence explicitly and clarify its impact on the results.
   
2. Theoretical Justification: Provide stronger theoretical arguments or evidence to support the claim that universality is a desirable feature of numerical methods. Discuss its practical implications in more detail.
3. Clarify Definitions: Clearly define key terms like algorithm (A) and ensemble (E) in the context of optimization problems. Provide examples to illustrate these definitions.
4. Address Key Questions Robustly: The paper lists five key questions but fails to address them adequately. Provide more detailed and well-supported answers to these questions, using both theoretical and empirical evidence.
5. Avoid Overstated Claims: Reframe the conclusions to reflect the limitations of the current work. Acknowledge the speculative nature of some claims and outline concrete steps for future research.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the dependence of epsilon on N affect the validity of the universality property? Can you provide empirical evidence to address this issue?
2. Why is universality considered a desirable feature of numerical methods? Can you provide specific examples or theoretical justifications to support this claim?
3. How do you define and measure the "scaling region" where universality is observed? Can this definition be generalized across different algorithms and problem settings?
4. Why were epsilon and N not tested in the experiments? Are there practical or theoretical challenges that prevented this?
5. Can you clarify the definitions of algorithm (A) and ensemble (E) in the context of non-convex optimization problems? How do these definitions apply to real-world scenarios?
By addressing these issues and expanding the scope of the experiments, the paper could make a stronger contribution to the understanding of universality in optimization algorithms.
