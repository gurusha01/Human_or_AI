Review
The paper presents a novel exploration of dialogue agents that improve their performance by asking questions during interactions with a simulated teacher. The authors design a synthetic environment in the movie domain to evaluate the agent's ability to handle scenarios with missing knowledge, misspellings, and reasoning challenges. The study also extends to real-world experiments using Mechanical Turk, validating the approach in more linguistically diverse settings. The key contribution lies in demonstrating that agents benefit from asking questions, both in offline supervised learning and online reinforcement learning settings, and in showing that this interaction improves performance in question-answering tasks.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its innovative approach to interactive learning for dialogue agents and its thorough experimental evaluation. The use of both synthetic and real-world data strengthens the validity of the findings, and the study addresses an important gap in current dialogue systems research by focusing on interactive learning rather than static training.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a unique framework for dialogue agents to learn through interaction, which is a significant step forward in developing more adaptive and intelligent conversational systems. The exploration of how agents can ask questions to address knowledge gaps or clarify queries is a valuable addition to the literature.
2. Experimental Rigor: The study is well-executed, with a comprehensive evaluation across multiple scenarios, including synthetic tasks and real-world data. The comparison of offline supervised learning and online reinforcement learning provides a holistic view of the agent's capabilities.
3. Validation with Real Data: The inclusion of Mechanical Turk experiments enhances the paper's credibility by demonstrating that the proposed methods generalize beyond synthetic environments.
Additional Feedback
1. Task Complexity: While the synthetic environment provides a controlled setting for experimentation, the tasks are overly simplistic and lack the linguistic richness of real-world interactions. Future work should focus on scaling the approach to more complex and realistic dialogue scenarios.
2. Focus on Core Contributions: The paper could benefit from narrowing its focus to basic reasoning and question-answering capabilities rather than attempting to address broader dialogue capabilities. This would make the contributions more precise and impactful.
3. Limitations and Future Directions: The paper acknowledges some limitations, such as the narrow focus on misspellings and the limited scope of misunderstandings addressed. A more detailed discussion of how the approach could scale to handle broader context misunderstandings or more diverse linguistic phenomena would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed approach handle more complex linguistic phenomena, such as ambiguous phrasing or idiomatic expressions, which are common in real-world dialogues?
2. What are the computational costs associated with scaling the framework to more realistic and diverse datasets?
3. Could the interaction framework be extended to multi-turn dialogues where the agent needs to ask multiple questions to resolve ambiguities?
Overall, the paper represents a strong contribution to the field of interactive dialogue systems and provides a solid foundation for future work in this area.
