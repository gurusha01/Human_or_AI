Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel application of Pointer Networks (PNs) for automated argumentation mining, specifically focusing on two subtasks: predicting links between argument components (ACs) and classifying AC types. The authors extend the PN architecture to jointly model these tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets: a corpus of persuasive essays and a microtext corpus. The paper highlights the advantages of using PNs, such as their ability to enforce tree structures in argumentation and their capacity for joint task optimization. The inclusion of a fully connected layer before the LSTM input and the joint modeling approach are identified as key contributors to the model's success. The results are supported by extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with prior work.
Decision: Reject  
While the paper presents an interesting application of Pointer Networks to argumentation mining, it lacks sufficient novelty and significant contributions to warrant acceptance. The approach is a straightforward application of an existing architecture to a single task, without introducing fundamentally new techniques or insights.
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of Novelty: The use of Pointer Networks for sequence-to-sequence tasks is well-established in the literature. While the paper adapts this architecture to argumentation mining, the modifications (e.g., joint modeling and a fully connected input layer) are incremental rather than groundbreaking. The work does not introduce fundamentally new ideas or methodologies that advance the field of argumentation mining or neural network architectures.
2. Limited Scope: The paper focuses narrowly on two subtasks (link prediction and AC classification) while assuming the completion of other subtasks in the argumentation pipeline (e.g., AC identification). This limits the broader applicability and impact of the proposed approach. Additionally, the results, while strong, are achieved on relatively small datasets, raising concerns about generalizability.
3. Positioning in Literature: The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from prior work. While it achieves state-of-the-art results, it does so by leveraging existing architectures and techniques rather than proposing novel approaches. The discussion of related work could be expanded to better contextualize the significance of the proposed method.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand the Scope: Integrating additional subtasks from the argumentation mining pipeline, such as AC identification or link type classification, would make the approach more comprehensive and impactful. This could also demonstrate the versatility of the proposed model.
2. Highlight Novelty: The authors should clarify and emphasize the unique contributions of their work. For example, if the joint modeling approach or the use of PNs in this context introduces new insights, these should be explicitly discussed and compared to alternative methods.
3. Broader Evaluation: Testing the model on larger and more diverse datasets would strengthen the claims of generalizability and robustness. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the model's predictions could provide deeper insights into its strengths and limitations.
4. Theoretical Contributions: Beyond empirical performance, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of why Pointer Networks are particularly suited for argumentation mining. This would help position the work as more than an application of existing techniques.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed model perform when integrated with subtasks 1 (AC identification) and 4 (link type classification)? Could the representations learned by the PN be extended to handle these tasks?
2. What are the limitations of the model when applied to longer sequences or more complex argument structures? How does it handle cases where the tree structure assumption does not hold?
3. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other sequence-to-sequence models or graph-based approaches for argumentation mining?
While the paper demonstrates strong empirical results, its incremental contributions and limited scope prevent it from making a significant impact in the field. Addressing the above concerns could substantially improve the paper's quality and relevance.
