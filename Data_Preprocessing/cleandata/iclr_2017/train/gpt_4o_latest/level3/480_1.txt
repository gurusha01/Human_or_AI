Review of the Paper
This paper presents a novel framework for detecting action patterns and modeling sensory-motor relationships in animals using a generative recurrent neural network (RNN). The authors propose a dual-path architecture, BESNet, which combines a discriminative path for action classification and a generative path for motion prediction. The framework is tested on two datasets: fruit fly behavior and online handwriting. The key contributions include leveraging motion prediction as an auxiliary task to improve action classification, generating realistic motion simulations, and discovering high-level behavioral phenomena from unlabeled data.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting approach with promising results, several issues hinder its acceptance in its current form. The main reasons for rejection are the lack of clarity in presenting results and insufficient exploration of key relationships (e.g., between diagonal and skip connections). Additionally, some claims, such as scaling to human behavior, are not adequately supported by the presented evidence.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Clarity of Results: The results, particularly in Figures 4 and 5, are difficult to interpret due to insufficient explanation. For instance, the differences between BESNet and BENet in per-bout scores and the implications of these differences are not adequately discussed. This lack of clarity diminishes the impact of the experimental findings.
2. Conceptual Ambiguity: The relationship between diagonal and skip connections is not clearly articulated. While diagonal connections are central to the proposed architecture, the paper does not sufficiently clarify how they differ from or relate to the more commonly understood skip connections.
3. Scaling Claims: The claim that the framework can scale to human behavior is theoretically sound but lacks empirical evidence. The authors should either provide preliminary results or temper these claims to align with the demonstrated capabilities.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Title Revision: The title should be revised to better reflect the paper's contributions. A more descriptive title could improve its accessibility to readers.
2. Term Definitions: Terms like "per-bout" and their context (e.g., duration) should be explicitly defined early in the paper to ensure clarity for readers unfamiliar with the domain.
3. Behavioral Time-Scale Analysis: The relationship between classification accuracy and the time-scale of behaviors (short-term vs. long-term) is an intriguing aspect that warrants further exploration. This could provide deeper insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
4. Comparative Analysis: While BESNet and BENet are compared, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of why BESNet outperforms BENet in certain metrics and how this relates to the auxiliary task of motion prediction.
5. Simulation Insights: The simulation results are visually compelling, but the paper should provide quantitative metrics to evaluate their realism and fidelity.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you clarify the distinction between diagonal and skip connections and their respective roles in the architecture?
2. How does the model handle multimodal motion prediction in practice, and how does this affect classification performance?
3. Could you provide more detailed explanations for Figures 4 and 5, particularly the implications of the observed trends?
4. Have you considered evaluating the framework on additional datasets, particularly those involving human behavior, to support your claims about scalability?
In conclusion, the paper presents an innovative approach with potential applications in behavior modeling. However, addressing the above concerns is essential to strengthen its contributions and improve its clarity. I encourage the authors to revise and resubmit after addressing these issues.
