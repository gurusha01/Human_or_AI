Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate the training of neural networks by leveraging an "introspection network" that predicts the weight evolution patterns of neural networks during training. The introspection network, trained on the weight evolution of a simple network, is used to update weights of unseen networks across diverse tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet), leading to faster convergence. The method demonstrates generalizability across architectures, datasets, and optimizers, while maintaining a low memory footprint and computational efficiency. The authors provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of their approach, showing significant reductions in training time compared to standard optimizers like SGD and Adam.
Decision: Accept (with Minor Revisions)
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novelty and potential impact. However, some key issues need to be addressed to improve clarity, reproducibility, and the strength of the results.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The idea of using a neural network to predict weight evolution patterns for accelerating training is innovative and well-motivated. The authors position their work effectively within the existing literature, highlighting how their approach differs from and improves upon prior methods.
   
2. Empirical Results: The results demonstrate consistent improvements in training time across multiple datasets and architectures, including large-scale experiments on ImageNet. This suggests the method's practical applicability and scalability.
3. Generalization: The introspection network trained on MNIST generalizes well to other datasets and architectures, showcasing the robustness of the proposed method.
Areas for Improvement
1. Reproducibility: Key details required to replicate the experiments are missing. For instance, specifics about the CNN layer sizes, learning rates, and training process of the introspection network are either incomplete or scattered across the paper. A consolidated, detailed description of these parameters is essential.
2. State-of-the-Art Comparison: While the results on ImageNet are promising, the use of a more competitive, state-of-the-art model (e.g., ResNet or Vision Transformers) would strengthen the claims. The current choice of AlexNet, while historically significant, is outdated for benchmarking modern methods.
3. Training Process of Introspection Network: The training procedure for the introspection network lacks sufficient detail. For example, it is unclear how the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., L1 loss, learning rate decay schedule) was made and whether these choices are optimal.
4. Early Training Limitations: The paper notes that applying the introspection network early in training can degrade performance. This limitation should be explored further, with potential solutions or explanations provided.
Questions for the Authors
1. What are the specific CNN architectures and hyperparameters (e.g., layer sizes, filter dimensions, learning rates) used in the experiments? A clear table summarizing these details would be helpful.
2. How does the introspection network perform when trained on a more diverse set of weight evolution data (e.g., from multiple datasets or architectures)? Could this improve its generalization further?
3. Why was AlexNet chosen for ImageNet experiments instead of a more modern architecture? Would the method scale effectively to deeper networks like ResNet or Transformers?
4. Can the introspection network be extended to non-image tasks (e.g., NLP or time-series data)? Have any preliminary experiments been conducted in this direction?
Additional Feedback
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, but some sections (e.g., training of the introspection network) could benefit from more concise and structured explanations.
- The authors should consider including a discussion on the computational overhead introduced by the introspection network, even if it is claimed to be negligible.
- Figures showing the weight evolution trends and their predictability are insightful but could be better annotated for clarity.
In conclusion, the paper presents a novel and promising idea with strong experimental results. Addressing the reproducibility and benchmarking concerns will significantly enhance the paper's impact and rigor.
