Review of the Paper
Summary of the Paper
This paper explores the use of a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, the Sigma Lognormal model, as an intermediate representation for sequence generation using Recurrent Mixture Density Networks (RMDNs). The authors propose that this representation abstracts the complexity of raw handwriting data into a concise motor plan and dynamic parameters, enabling benefits such as style transfer, one-shot learning, and resolution independence. The system is evaluated on tasks like virtual target prediction and dynamic parameter prediction, with qualitative results suggesting its potential for generating handwriting-like sequences and mixing styles.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected due to insufficient evaluation, lack of clarity in methodology, and inadequate placement in the existing literature.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Evaluation Concerns: The paper does not provide quantitative evaluations or comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for sequence generation or handwriting synthesis. The results are primarily qualitative, making it difficult to assess the scientific rigor or the claimed benefits of the proposed approach.
2. Literature Gaps: While the paper builds on Graves (2013) and Plamondon et al., it fails to adequately reference recent advancements in motion prediction and sequence generation models that do not rely on preprocessing. This omission weakens the paper's positioning in the broader research landscape.
3. Methodological Clarity: Key aspects of the methodology, such as the reconstruction of stroke sequences from the IAM dataset and the conditioning of the V2V model, are insufficiently detailed. Additionally, the choice of Berio & Leymarie (2015) as a preprocessing method is not well explained, leaving the paper less self-contained.
4. Motivation and Usefulness: The motivation for using the Sigma Lognormal model as an intermediate representation is not convincingly argued. The usefulness of this representation in the context of a fully trained model remains questionable without proper evaluation.
5. Presentation Issues: The paper contains numerous typos and word omissions, which detract from its readability and professionalism. Section 3, in particular, lacks clarity in explaining the application and motivation of the work.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Quantitative Evaluation: The authors should include quantitative metrics (e.g., reconstruction error, style similarity scores) and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods to substantiate their claims.
2. Broader Literature Review: Incorporate references to recent models for sequence prediction and motion generation that do not rely on preprocessing. This will strengthen the paper's relevance and contextualization.
3. Clarify Methodology: Provide more details about the preprocessing steps, the V2V model's conditioning, and the generation of stroke sequences from the IAM dataset. This will make the paper more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the specific methods used.
4. Motivation and Use Case: Clearly articulate the advantages of the Sigma Lognormal model over raw data-based approaches. Include experiments that demonstrate its usefulness in practical applications.
5. Proofreading: Carefully proofread the paper to eliminate typos, grammatical errors, and word omissions. This will improve its readability and professionalism.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed approach compare quantitatively with Graves (2013) and other state-of-the-art handwriting generation methods?
2. What is the rationale for using Berio & Leymarie (2015) for preprocessing instead of more recent or robust methods?
3. How were stroke sequences generated from the offline IAM dataset, and how does this affect the fidelity of the results?
4. Can the authors provide evidence or experiments to demonstrate the practical benefits of the Sigma Lognormal representation in reducing training data requirements or improving model performance?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting idea, it requires significant improvements in evaluation, methodological clarity, and literature contextualization to meet the standards of the conference.
