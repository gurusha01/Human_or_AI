Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper explores the use of a physiologically plausible model of handwriting, the Sigma Lognormal model, as a feature representation for sequence generation using recurrent mixture density networks (RMDNs). The authors propose a modular framework that preprocesses handwriting data into motor plans and dynamic parameters, enabling tasks such as handwriting synthesis, style transfer, and one-shot learning. The paper emphasizes the advantages of this intermediate representation, such as resolution independence, data augmentation, and the ability to learn from small datasets. The experiments demonstrate qualitative results for handwriting generation, style transfer, and one-shot learning, and the task descriptions are engaging and well-written.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected primarily for the following reasons:
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper does not propose any new machine learning algorithms or architectures but instead reuses existing methods such as LSTMs and bivariate mixture density networks. While the application of these methods to handwriting generation is interesting, it does not meet the novelty threshold for ICLR.
2. Insufficient Empirical Validation: The paper lacks quantitative evaluations to demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The results are primarily qualitative and do not provide rigorous evidence for the claims made.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty: The paper builds on prior work by Graves (2013) and others but does not introduce significant algorithmic innovations. The use of the Sigma Lognormal model as a preprocessing step is intriguing but not sufficiently novel to warrant publication at a top-tier machine learning conference like ICLR.
2. Empirical Validation: While the qualitative results are visually compelling, the absence of numerical benchmarks or comparisons with state-of-the-art methods leaves the claims unsupported. For example, the paper does not provide metrics such as reconstruction error, style transfer accuracy, or user studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. Critical Omission: The appendix lacks a clear explanation of how Gaussian parameters are derived from the LSTM output, which is a key technical detail for reproducibility.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Numerical Evaluation: The authors should include quantitative metrics to evaluate the performance of their method against existing approaches. For example, comparisons with Graves (2013) on handwriting synthesis tasks or user studies to assess the quality of generated handwriting could strengthen the paper.
2. Clarity in Appendix: The derivation of Gaussian parameters from LSTM outputs should be clearly explained in the appendix. This is critical for reproducibility and understanding the technical contributions.
3. Conference Fit: The paper may be better suited for a conference focused on handwriting recognition or human-computer interaction, where the application of machine learning methods to handwriting generation would be more aligned with the audience's interests.
4. Broader Context: The authors could better position their work in the broader literature by discussing how their approach compares to other data-driven handwriting synthesis methods, such as GANs or transformers.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do the generated handwriting sequences compare quantitatively to those generated by Graves (2013) or other state-of-the-art methods?
2. Can you provide more details on the derivation of Gaussian parameters from LSTM outputs? This is currently missing from the appendix.
3. Have you considered evaluating the perceptual quality of the generated handwriting through user studies or other human-centric evaluations?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting application of existing methods to handwriting synthesis, the lack of novelty, empirical rigor, and critical technical details makes it unsuitable for acceptance at ICLR. However, with additional quantitative evaluations and clearer technical explanations, the work could be impactful in a more application-focused venue.
