Review of "Edward: A Turing-Complete Probabilistic Programming Language"
The paper introduces Edward, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) that integrates compositional representations for both modeling and inference, leveraging TensorFlow for computational efficiency. Edward aims to bridge the gap between the expressiveness of probabilistic models and the efficiency of deep learning frameworks. The authors highlight its flexibility in supporting a variety of inference techniques (e.g., variational inference, MCMC) and its ability to reuse model representations for inference. The paper claims significant speedups over existing PPLs, such as Stan and PyMC3, and proposes a "Probability Zoo" for pre-trained probabilistic models.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an exciting contribution to probabilistic programming, it falls short in critical areas such as empirical validation, clarity of presentation, and practical applicability. These deficiencies limit its readiness for publication in its current form.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Strengths:
   - The concept of treating inference as a "first-class citizen" is innovative and well-motivated, addressing limitations in existing PPLs.
   - Integration with TensorFlow provides computational advantages, as demonstrated by the reported speedups in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) experiments.
   - The composability of inference methods is a notable strength, enabling flexibility in designing complex algorithms.
   - The "Probability Zoo" is a promising initiative to foster community engagement and reproducibility.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Empirical Validation: The experiments are limited to a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with standard inference techniques, which are relatively straightforward to implement. Broader applicability to more complex or diverse models is not demonstrated.
   - HMC Results: While runtime improvements are reported, the effectiveness of HMC (e.g., convergence diagnostics, quality of posterior samples) is not evaluated, leaving questions about its practical utility.
   - Practicality: The paper does not convincingly demonstrate Edward's usability in real-world scenarios. Missing runtime reports for other inference methods and the absence of diagnostic tools for automated inference further weaken its practical appeal.
   - Presentation: The paper suffers from unclear variable definitions (e.g., `qbeta`, `qz`), unexplained parameter choices (e.g., `alpha=-1` in Table 1), and typographical errors. Early discussion of implementation details and inference mechanics would improve readability.
Additional Feedback:
To strengthen the paper, the authors should address the following:
1. Expand Experiments: Evaluate Edward on a broader range of models (e.g., Bayesian neural networks, hierarchical models) and include benchmarks against other PPLs (e.g., runtime, predictive log-likelihood, convergence metrics).
2. HMC Evaluation: Provide detailed results on the quality of HMC inference, including convergence diagnostics and posterior accuracy.
3. Model Zoo Benchmarks: Clarify the datasets and benchmarks intended for the proposed "Probability Zoo." Including results on standard datasets would enhance its credibility.
4. Comparative Analysis: A comparative table summarizing the performance of Edward against other inference tools would be highly insightful.
5. Clarity and Presentation: Improve the paper's structure by introducing implementation details earlier and providing clearer explanations of variables and parameter choices. Address minor issues such as typographical errors and unclear definitions (e.g., `x_real` in Figure 7).
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does Edward handle inference challenges when users lack full control over the computational graph structure (e.g., in HMC)?
2. Can you provide runtime and accuracy comparisons for inference methods other than HMC (e.g., variational inference)?
3. What datasets and benchmarks are intended for the "Probability Zoo," and how do you envision its adoption by the community?
4. How does Edward's performance compare to other PPLs on tasks requiring complex control flow or recursion?
In conclusion, Edward is a promising contribution to probabilistic programming, but significant improvements in empirical validation, presentation, and practical demonstration are required for it to meet the standards of this conference.
