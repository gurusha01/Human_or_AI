The paper proposes a pedestrian detection method leveraging Fast R-CNN with batch normalization and EdgeBoxes for generating region proposals. The authors aim to improve detection efficiency and accuracy by incorporating batch normalization to enhance training convergence and generalization, and by employing EdgeBoxes to produce high-quality, low-redundancy region proposals. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and demonstrates competitive performance, though it does not surpass state-of-the-art methods.
Decision: Reject
Key Reasons for Rejection:
1. Lack of Novelty: The proposed method primarily builds on existing techniques, namely Fast R-CNN and EdgeBoxes, with the addition of batch normalization. While the integration is well-executed, the contribution is incremental and lacks significant innovation.
2. Performance Limitations: Although the method achieves reasonable results, it does not outperform state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark datasets. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate a clear advantage over existing methods in terms of accuracy or computational efficiency.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Tackled and Motivation: The paper addresses the well-defined problem of pedestrian detection in complex environments. The motivation for using batch normalization to improve training efficiency and EdgeBoxes for better region proposals is sound and grounded in prior literature. However, the approach is largely a straightforward application of known techniques without introducing novel insights or methodologies.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental evaluation on INRIA and ETH datasets is thorough, with detailed comparisons to other methods. The results indicate that the proposed method performs competitively but does not achieve state-of-the-art performance. The reported improvements in training time and detection speed are modest and do not significantly differentiate the method.
3. Scientific Rigor: The implementation details and evaluation metrics are clearly described, and the experiments are conducted rigorously. However, the lack of novelty and limited performance gains undermine the overall impact of the work.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Highlight Novelty: The authors should emphasize any unique aspects of their approach, such as specific innovations in the integration of batch normalization or improvements to the EdgeBoxes algorithm. Alternatively, proposing a new architecture or methodology could significantly enhance the paper's contribution.
2. Broader Evaluation: Expanding the evaluation to include additional datasets or real-world scenarios could provide stronger evidence of the method's generalization capabilities.
3. Comparative Analysis: A deeper analysis of why the method underperforms compared to state-of-the-art approaches, such as SDN or TA-CNN, would be valuable. Identifying specific limitations and proposing solutions could strengthen the paper.
4. Ablation Studies: Including ablation studies to isolate the impact of batch normalization and EdgeBoxes on performance would provide clearer insights into the contributions of each component.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method handle challenges such as occlusion or varying pedestrian scales compared to state-of-the-art methods?
2. Could the authors provide more details on the computational trade-offs between using EdgeBoxes and other region proposal methods like Selective Search or RPNs?
3. Have the authors considered integrating more recent advancements in object detection architectures, such as Faster R-CNN or YOLO, to improve performance?
In summary, while the paper demonstrates a well-executed application of existing techniques, its lack of novelty and limited performance improvements do not justify acceptance in its current form. Addressing the outlined concerns and providing a more significant contribution could make the work more impactful.
