Review of "Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA)"
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach, Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA), which combines Variational Recurrent Neural Networks (VRNN) with adversarial training for domain adaptation in multivariate time-series data. The primary contribution lies in extending VRNN to learn domain-invariant representations while preserving temporal latent dependencies, which is particularly relevant for healthcare datasets like MIMIC-III. The authors claim that this is the first model to transfer temporal latent dependencies across domains in unsupervised settings. Empirical results demonstrate that VRADA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, including DANN and R-DANN, on tasks such as mortality prediction and ICD9 code classification.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses an important problem and shows promising results, the novelty and clarity of the work are insufficient to warrant acceptance. Below are the key reasons for this decision:
1. Limited Novelty: The primary contribution—extending VRNN with adversarial training—feels incremental. While the combination of VRNN and adversarial training is novel in this specific context, it builds directly on well-established methods (VRNN and DANN). The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from R-DANN, which also uses temporal models for domain adaptation.
   
2. Unclear Source of Performance Gains: Although VRADA outperforms baselines, the paper does not convincingly explain why VRNN-based representations lead to better performance compared to RNN-based ones in R-DANN. The lack of detailed analysis on temporal dependency modeling and its impact on domain adaptation limits the interpretability of the results.
Supporting Arguments
1. Empirical Results: The quantitative results in Tables 1 and 2 show consistent improvements for VRADA over baselines. However, the gains are modest (1-4% improvement in AUC), and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to attribute these improvements to the proposed model's ability to capture temporal latent dependencies. For example, the comparison with R-DANN lacks a detailed analysis of why VRNN-based representations are superior.
2. Clarity Issues: Several figures and tables require better explanations. For instance, Figure 1(b) does not clarify whether it represents DANN or R-DANN, and the latent factors in Figure 1(c) are not well-defined. Similarly, Figures 3 and 4, which aim to illustrate temporal dependencies, lack detailed axis descriptions and fail to provide a clear narrative connecting the visualizations to the claims.
3. Theoretical Justification: While the paper provides a mathematical formulation of VRADA, it does not delve deeply into why adversarial training with VRNN would inherently lead to better domain-invariant representations compared to other temporal models. A stronger theoretical grounding would strengthen the paper's contributions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Figures and Tables: Provide detailed captions and explanations for all figures and tables. For example, clarify the differences between DANN, R-DANN, and VRADA in Figure 1 and explicitly describe the axes and patterns in Figures 3 and 4.
2. Analyze Temporal Dependencies: Include a more thorough analysis of how VRNN captures temporal dependencies differently from RNNs in R-DANN. For example, ablation studies or visualizations of learned temporal patterns could help demonstrate the unique strengths of VRADA.
3. Explain Performance Gains: Provide a detailed breakdown of why VRADA outperforms baselines. Is it due to better domain-invariant representations, improved temporal modeling, or other factors? Comparative experiments isolating these aspects would strengthen the claims.
4. Broaden the Scope of Experiments: While healthcare datasets are a strong use case, testing VRADA on other multivariate time-series datasets (e.g., financial or sensor data) would demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the use of VRNN specifically contribute to the observed performance gains over R-DANN? Can you provide quantitative or qualitative evidence to support this?
2. What is the rationale behind using adversarial training only at the last time-step? Would adversarial training at every time-step improve performance?
3. In Figure 1(b), does the visualization represent DANN or R-DANN? Can you clarify the latent factors in Figure 1(c)?
4. Why does VRADA show more consistent performance across validation and test sets in Table 2 compared to baselines? Could this be due to overfitting in other models?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses a relevant problem and shows promising results, the limited novelty, lack of clarity, and insufficient analysis of performance gains prevent it from meeting the standards of this conference. Addressing these issues in a revised version could significantly strengthen the paper.
