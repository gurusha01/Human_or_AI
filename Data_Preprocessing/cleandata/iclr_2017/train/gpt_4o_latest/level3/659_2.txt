Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a supervised sequence-to-sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism, combining traditional statistical alignment methods with the encoder-decoder neural network framework. The proposed model is specifically designed to handle tasks with monotonic alignments, such as morphological inflection generation. By leveraging pre-learned alignments, the model simplifies training and achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets, including CELEX, Wiktionary, and SIGMORPHON 2016. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the learned alignments and representations, demonstrating the advantages of the hard attention mechanism over soft attention in certain scenarios, particularly for low-resource settings. The paper is well-written, with thorough experimental evaluation and insightful analysis.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is well-executed and presents promising results, the limited novelty and scope of the contribution make it more suitable as a short paper. The proposed approach, while effective, is an incremental improvement over existing methods rather than a fundamentally new idea. Additionally, the lack of comparison to some prior works and the limited applicability to shorter sequences further constrain its impact.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The paper addresses an important problem in sequence transduction and provides a clear motivation for the use of hard attention in monotonic alignment tasks.
   - Experimental results demonstrate improvements over both neural and non-neural baselines, particularly in low-resource settings, where the model outperforms soft attention and weighted finite state transducer (FST) approaches.
   - The analysis of learned alignments and representations is thorough, offering valuable insights into the behavior of hard and soft attention mechanisms.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Limited Novelty: The combination of pre-learned alignments with a hard attention mechanism is not a groundbreaking innovation. Similar ideas have been explored in prior works, such as alignment-aware neural transduction models.
   - Scope: The model is specifically tailored for tasks with monotonic alignments and shorter sequences, limiting its general applicability. For languages or tasks requiring long-range dependencies, the model underperforms compared to soft attention.
   - Missing Comparisons: The paper does not compare its approach to some relevant prior works, such as those involving hybrid attention mechanisms or more recent advancements in morphological inflection generation.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broaden the Scope: Consider extending the model to handle non-monotonic alignments or longer sequences, which would make the approach more widely applicable.
2. Include Additional Comparisons: Evaluate the model against more recent or hybrid approaches to provide a comprehensive benchmark.
3. Clarify Novelty: Emphasize the unique aspects of the proposed method compared to prior works, particularly in terms of its simplicity and training efficiency.
4. Expand the Discussion: Discuss potential applications of the model beyond morphological inflection generation, such as transliteration or abstractive summarization, to highlight its versatility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform on tasks with non-monotonic alignments or longer sequences? Could the hard attention mechanism be adapted for such tasks?
2. Why were certain prior works, such as those involving hybrid attention mechanisms, not included in the experimental comparisons?
3. Could the use of alternative alignment methods (e.g., neural alignment models) further improve the performance of the proposed approach?
In conclusion, while the paper presents a well-executed study with strong experimental results, its limited novelty and scope reduce its overall impact. Addressing the above concerns could significantly enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
