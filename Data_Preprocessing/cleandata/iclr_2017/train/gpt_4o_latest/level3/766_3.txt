Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, incorporating batch normalization to improve training efficiency and generalization. The authors utilize the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate high-quality region proposals, aiming to reduce redundancy and improve detection accuracy. The method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, and claims to achieve satisfactory performance compared to existing methods. The authors highlight the addition of batch normalization as a key contribution to address internal covariate shift and improve convergence during training.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of novelty and insufficient placement in the context of recent advancements in object detection. The work is a standard application of Fast R-CNN with minor modifications (batch normalization and EdgeBoxes), both of which have been previously explored. Furthermore, the omission of the widely-used Caltech Pedestrians dataset weakens the empirical evaluation. The results, while satisfactory, do not achieve state-of-the-art performance, further limiting the contribution of the paper.
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper does not introduce any significant innovation. The use of EdgeBoxes for region proposals and batch normalization in Fast R-CNN are well-documented techniques. The authors fail to demonstrate how their approach advances the field beyond existing methods.
2. Limited Awareness of Literature: The paper does not acknowledge or compare its approach to Faster R-CNN, a more advanced and widely-used object detection framework that eliminates the need for external region proposal methods like EdgeBoxes. This oversight suggests a lack of awareness of recent developments in the field.
3. Evaluation Weaknesses: The omission of the Caltech Pedestrians dataset, a standard benchmark for pedestrian detection, limits the generalizability and comparability of the results. While the method performs reasonably well on INRIA and ETH datasets, it does not outperform state-of-the-art methods, such as SpatialPooling and TA-CNN, on these benchmarks.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Incorporate Novel Contributions: The authors should explore innovative techniques or modifications to the Fast R-CNN framework that address specific challenges in pedestrian detection, such as occlusion handling or low-resolution images.
2. Expand Evaluation: Including the Caltech Pedestrians dataset would strengthen the empirical evaluation and allow for direct comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
3. Engage with Recent Literature: The authors should consider integrating or comparing their approach with Faster R-CNN or other modern object detection frameworks. This would demonstrate awareness of advancements and provide a stronger baseline for comparison.
4. Clarify Contributions: The paper should clearly articulate its unique contributions and demonstrate how they address gaps or limitations in existing methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was the Caltech Pedestrians dataset excluded from the evaluation? How do you justify the generalizability of your method without testing on this widely-used benchmark?
2. How does your method compare to Faster R-CNN, which eliminates the need for external region proposal methods like EdgeBoxes?
3. Can you provide more details on the computational efficiency of your approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods, particularly in real-time applications?
In summary, while the paper demonstrates a competent application of Fast R-CNN with batch normalization and EdgeBoxes, it lacks the novelty and rigor required for acceptance. Addressing the outlined weaknesses and engaging more deeply with recent advancements in object detection would significantly improve the quality of the work.
