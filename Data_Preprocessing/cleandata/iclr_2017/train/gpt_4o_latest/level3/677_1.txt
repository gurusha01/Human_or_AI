Review
Summary of Contributions  
The paper proposes an innovative unsupervised method for graph representation learning using an encoder-decoder model inspired by natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically the skip-thought model. By leveraging random walks on graph-structured data, the method generates embeddings that group structurally and functionally similar subgraphs in feature space. The paper evaluates the proposed approach on graph classification tasks using chemical compound datasets and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. The authors highlight the general-purpose nature of the embeddings, which can be used across multiple machine learning tasks.
Decision: Reject  
While the paper introduces an interesting and novel approach, it falls short in critical areas such as comparative analysis, experimental rigor, and presentation quality. These shortcomings limit its suitability for acceptance in its current form.
Supporting Arguments for Decision  
1. Lack of Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods: The paper does not adequately compare its approach with graph kernel methods, which are a well-established baseline for graph representation learning. While some comparisons are made with other methods like ECFP and NeuralFPS, the omission of graph kernels weakens the empirical evaluation.  
2. Insufficient Motivation and Distinction: The paper does not clearly articulate how the proposed method differs fundamentally from graph kernel methods or why it is better suited for the task. The motivation for using skip-thought-inspired models for graph embeddings is not thoroughly justified.  
3. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments focus solely on classification accuracy, neglecting other important tasks such as clustering, search, and prediction. This narrow evaluation does not demonstrate the general-purpose nature of the embeddings as claimed.  
4. Presentation Issues: The paper contains numerous typos and unclear statements, which detract from its readability and professionalism. Additionally, the figures and tables are not sufficiently explained, making it difficult to interpret some results.  
5. Lack of Broader Comparisons: The experiments are limited to a few datasets and do not explore the method's performance on diverse graph types or larger datasets, which would better validate its generalizability.
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Expand Comparative Analysis: Include a thorough comparison with graph kernel methods and other state-of-the-art techniques, especially those designed for graph-level tasks.  
2. Broaden Experimental Evaluation: Evaluate the method on a wider range of tasks (e.g., clustering, search) and datasets, including larger and more diverse graphs. This would better support the claim of general-purpose embeddings.  
3. Clarify Motivation: Provide a stronger theoretical or empirical justification for why the skip-thought-inspired model is particularly well-suited for graph representation learning.  
4. Improve Presentation: Address typos, improve clarity in the text, and provide more detailed explanations of figures and tables. A polished presentation will make the paper more accessible to readers.  
5. Analyze Limitations: Discuss the limitations of the proposed method, such as potential scalability issues or sensitivity to hyperparameters, to provide a balanced perspective.  
Questions for Authors  
1. How does the proposed method compare to graph kernel methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency?  
2. Can the embeddings generated by the model be effectively used for tasks beyond classification, such as clustering or link prediction?  
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of random walk parameters (e.g., length, number of walks)?  
4. Why were only chemical compound datasets used for evaluation? Would the method generalize to social networks or other types of graphs?  
5. Could the authors elaborate on the functional similarity aspect of the embeddings and provide more concrete examples or visualizations?  
In conclusion, while the paper introduces a novel approach with potential, significant improvements are needed in comparative analysis, experimental scope, and presentation quality to make it suitable for acceptance.
