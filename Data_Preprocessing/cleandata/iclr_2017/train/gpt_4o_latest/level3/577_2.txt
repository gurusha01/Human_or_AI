Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces the concept of linear classifier probes as a tool to evaluate the informativeness of intermediate layers in neural networks. These probes are designed to assess the suitability of hidden layer representations for linear classification without interfering with the training process. The authors argue that this approach provides insights into the dynamics of neural network training and the roles of individual layers. The paper demonstrates the utility of probes through experiments on toy models, MNIST, and Inception v3, highlighting their potential to diagnose issues such as vanishing gradients and to evaluate architectural modifications like skip connections and auxiliary losses. The authors position their method as a heuristic for understanding neural networks, rather than a definitive theoretical framework.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected due to insufficient theoretical justification for the proposed method and a lack of actionable insights for improving neural network design. While the problem is interesting and the experiments provide some useful observations, the technique lacks novelty and practical applicability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Insufficient Justification for Linear Classifier Probes: The choice of linear classifiers as probes is not adequately justified. While the authors argue that linear classifiers are simple and interpretable, the paper does not provide a theoretical basis or strong intuition for why this approach is the most appropriate for evaluating layer-wise representations. This weakens the conceptual foundation of the work.
2. Limited Novelty: The idea of using probes to evaluate intermediate layers is not entirely new, as similar techniques have been explored in prior work. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from existing methods or demonstrate significant advancements over them.
3. Lack of Actionable Insights: While the experiments confirm known phenomena (e.g., skip connections improve training, lower layers converge faster), the findings do not translate into concrete guidelines for designing better neural networks. The paper falls short of its stated goal of enabling researchers to justify architectural heuristics or improve model design.
4. Experimental Limitations: The experiments are primarily conducted on toy models and small datasets like MNIST, with limited exploration of larger, more complex models. The Inception v3 experiment is incomplete and does not provide compelling evidence for the method's scalability or utility in real-world scenarios.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Strengthen Theoretical Justification: Provide a rigorous theoretical analysis or a stronger intuitive argument for why linear classifiers are an appropriate choice for probes. Consider comparing them to alternative methods, such as multi-layer probes or other interpretability techniques.
2. Expand Experimental Scope: Conduct more extensive experiments on larger and more diverse datasets and architectures. This would help demonstrate the generalizability and practical utility of the proposed method.
3. Provide Actionable Insights: Focus on deriving concrete, actionable guidelines for network design based on the findings. For example, how can the probe results inform decisions about layer depth, skip connections, or auxiliary losses?
4. Address Limitations: Acknowledge and address the limitations of the method, such as its reliance on convex optimization and the potential for misleading conclusions if probes are not optimized properly.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was a linear classifier chosen as the probe instead of more sophisticated models? Could multi-layer probes or other techniques provide better insights?
2. How do you address the potential overfitting of probes, especially in high-dimensional layers with large numbers of features?
3. Can the findings from toy models and MNIST experiments be reliably extrapolated to more complex architectures and datasets?
4. How do you envision this method being used in practice to guide the design of neural networks?
While the paper tackles an interesting and relevant problem, it requires stronger justification, broader experimentation, and clearer practical contributions to meet the standards of acceptance.
