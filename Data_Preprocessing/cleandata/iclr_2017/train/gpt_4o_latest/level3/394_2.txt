The paper introduces Zoneout, a novel regularization technique for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Unlike dropout, which sets activations to zero, Zoneout stochastically retains the previous activations of certain hidden units, thereby preserving gradient flow and state information. This approach is conceptually simple and generalizable to various RNN architectures. The authors demonstrate Zoneout's efficacy through experiments on tasks such as language modeling (Penn Treebank, Text8) and sequential classification (permuted MNIST). The results show that Zoneout achieves competitive performance, including state-of-the-art results on permuted MNIST when combined with recurrent batch normalization.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a novel, well-motivated idea that is clearly articulated and experimentally validated. While Zoneout does not outperform variational dropout on all tasks, its simplicity, broad applicability, and demonstrated effectiveness across multiple datasets make it a valuable contribution to the field. The paper is of high quality, with rigorous experiments and clear writing, and is likely to interest a wide audience working with RNNs.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: Zoneout introduces a new perspective on regularization by preserving hidden states, which differentiates it from existing methods like dropout and variational dropout. The idea is simple yet impactful, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and improving gradient flow.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct thorough experiments across diverse tasks, demonstrating Zoneout's effectiveness. The results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods, and the combination of Zoneout with other techniques (e.g., recurrent batch normalization) highlights its complementary nature.
3. Clarity and Quality: The paper is well-written, with detailed explanations of Zoneout and its implementation. The experimental setup is clearly described, and the results are presented comprehensively.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Hyperparameter Tuning: The paper acknowledges that Zoneout underperforms variational dropout on the Penn Treebank task. A more extensive hyperparameter search might improve results and provide a fairer comparison.
2. Noise vs. Identity Connections: While the authors briefly explore the contributions of noise injection and identity connections, a more detailed analysis (e.g., testing with fixed masks over unrolled networks) would strengthen the understanding of Zoneout's benefits.
3. Broader Comparisons: Including comparisons with additional recent regularization techniques for RNNs would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of Zoneout's relative strengths and weaknesses.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is Zoneout to the choice of probabilities for zoning out cells versus hidden states? Could an adaptive mechanism for determining these probabilities improve performance?
2. Did you observe any trade-offs between training time and generalization performance when using Zoneout compared to other regularization methods?
3. Could Zoneout be extended to architectures beyond RNNs, such as transformers or other sequence models?
In conclusion, Zoneout is a promising and practical regularization technique for RNNs, with demonstrated utility across tasks. Addressing the minor suggestions above could further enhance the paper's impact. I recommend acceptance.
