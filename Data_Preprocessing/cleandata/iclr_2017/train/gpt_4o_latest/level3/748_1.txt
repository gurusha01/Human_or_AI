Review
Summary
The paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for neural machine translation (NMT), which is competitive with traditional bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) baselines. The authors argue that CNNs offer advantages in parallelizability and shorter computational paths for capturing long-range dependencies. The architecture incorporates stacked CNNs with residual connections and position embeddings, and it uses separate CNNs for attention score computation and conditional input aggregation. The paper provides a thorough experimental evaluation, demonstrating comparable or superior BLEU scores on several benchmark datasets (e.g., WMT'16 English-Romanian, WMT'15 English-German, and WMT'14 English-French). Sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the optimal number of CNN layers, and the results highlight the importance of architectural choices like position embeddings and residual connections. The authors also report significant speed improvements in decoding compared to BiLSTM-based models.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Scientific Contribution: The paper demonstrates that convolutional architectures, when combined with attention mechanisms and position embeddings, can match or surpass the performance of BiLSTM-based NMT systems. This is a significant contribution, given that prior CNN-based attempts failed to achieve competitive results.
2. Practical Impact: The proposed architecture offers substantial speed improvements in decoding, making it highly relevant for real-world applications where computational efficiency is critical.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper builds on prior work in NMT and addresses the limitations of recurrent networks, such as sequential computation constraints. The use of position embeddings and residual connections is well-justified and supported by experimental results.
2. Rigorous Evaluation: The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and provide detailed sensitivity analyses. The results are robust, with clear comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
3. Clarity of Results: The experimental results are well-reported, showing not only BLEU scores but also insights into training and decoding speed. The sensitivity analysis adds depth to the evaluation, demonstrating the impact of architectural choices.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Figures for Architecture: The paper would benefit from clear visualizations of the proposed architecture, particularly the stacked CNNs and their interaction with the attention mechanism. This would aid in understanding the design choices and their implications.
2. Novelty: While the work is solid, it primarily combines existing techniques (e.g., CNNs, attention, position embeddings) rather than introducing fundamentally new representation learning methods. The authors could emphasize the novelty of their specific architectural design more explicitly.
3. Training Convergence: The authors mention slower convergence with CNNs compared to BiLSTMs. Exploring techniques to improve convergence (e.g., adaptive optimizers or better initialization strategies) could strengthen the practical utility of the model.
4. Generalization Beyond NMT: The paper briefly mentions potential applications to other sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., summarization, parsing). Including preliminary results or a discussion of how the architecture might generalize would enhance the broader impact of the work.
Questions for the Authors
1. Could you provide a detailed visualization of the architecture, particularly the interaction between CNN-a and CNN-c?
2. How does the model handle very long sentences where the context size might exceed the receptive field of the CNN? Is there a noticeable drop in performance for such cases?
3. Have you explored alternative optimization strategies to address the slower convergence of CNNs compared to BiLSTMs?
4. Could the proposed architecture benefit from recent advances in self-attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer models? How does it compare to Transformers in terms of accuracy and speed?
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of NMT by demonstrating the viability of CNN-based architectures, and it is well-suited for acceptance at the conference.
