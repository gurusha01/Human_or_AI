The paper proposes a novel read-again attention-based hierarchical representation for abstractive summarization, coupled with a copy mechanism to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The main contribution is the read-again mechanism, which enables the model to process each sentence twice, improving the representation of the input document. This approach is evaluated on the DUC 2004 dataset and demonstrates modest improvements over baseline models. The authors also claim state-of-the-art performance on the Gigaword dataset, emphasizing the efficiency of their copy mechanism in reducing vocabulary size while maintaining performance.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons: (1) the lack of novelty in the proposed read-again mechanism, which closely resembles prior work, and (2) the limited scientific contribution, as the paper is heavily application-focused with minimal theoretical insights or advancements in machine learning.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Lack of Novelty: While the read-again mechanism is presented as a key innovation, similar ideas have been explored in prior work (e.g., bidirectional RNNs and attention-based models). The paper does not adequately differentiate its approach or provide strong theoretical justifications for its design choices. This diminishes the originality of the contribution.
2. Limited Gains: The reported improvements over baselines on the DUC 2004 dataset are marginal, raising questions about the practical significance of the proposed method. Furthermore, the specific contribution of the read-again mechanism to these improvements is unclear, as the results could also be attributed to the copy mechanism or other implementation details.
3. Writing Quality: The paper suffers from several typos, unclear explanations, and poor organization, which hinder comprehension. For example, the naming of the model and the placement of tables are inconsistent, and some technical details are not adequately explained.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Broader Evaluation: Testing the read-again mechanism on additional tasks, such as neural machine translation (NMT), could strengthen the paper's contributions and demonstrate its generalizability.
2. Ablation Studies: Conducting detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of the read-again mechanism from other components, such as the copy mechanism, would provide clearer insights into its effectiveness.
3. Writing and Organization: The paper would benefit from thorough proofreading and restructuring to improve clarity and flow. Precise language and consistent formatting are essential for better readability.
4. Novelty Justification: The authors should explicitly address how their approach differs from and improves upon existing methods, particularly in comparison to bidirectional RNNs and prior attention-based models.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the training speed of the proposed model compare to a regular LSTM-based encoder-decoder model? Does the read-again mechanism introduce significant computational overhead?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed results or visualizations that demonstrate the specific impact of the read-again mechanism on document representation quality?
3. Have the authors considered alternative tasks or datasets to validate the generalizability of their approach?
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting application of hierarchical attention and copy mechanisms, its limited novelty, marginal improvements, and unclear justifications for design choices make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form.
