Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a set of techniques for sampling and visualizing the latent spaces of generative models, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Key contributions include the use of spherical linear interpolation (slerp) for smoother transitions in latent space, J-Diagrams for visualizing analogies, MINE grids for local manifold traversal, and methods for deriving attribute vectors using bias correction and synthetic augmentation. The authors also propose a quantitative evaluation method for attribute vectors through binary classification tasks. The techniques are presented as model-agnostic and applicable across different generative frameworks, with examples provided for both VAEs and GANs.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces practical and useful techniques for practitioners in the generative modeling community, it lacks the theoretical depth and rigorous evaluation expected at a venue like ICLR. The absence of new algorithms, models, or theoretical insights into generative modeling, along with the lack of quantitative comparisons to existing methods, weakens its contribution. Additionally, the paper does not provide sufficient justification for why ICLR is the appropriate venue for this work.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:  
   - The techniques are simple, intuitive, and immediately useful for practitioners working with generative models.  
   - The explanations are clear, and the visualizations (e.g., J-Diagrams, MINE grids) are compelling tools for understanding latent space structure.  
   - The introduction of bias-corrected and synthetic attribute vectors addresses practical challenges in working with labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively.  
2. Weaknesses:  
   - The paper does not propose a new algorithm, model, or theoretical framework, which limits its novelty.  
   - There is no quantitative evaluation or comparison of the proposed techniques with existing methods, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. For example, while slerp is claimed to produce sharper samples, no empirical evidence or metrics (e.g., FID, IS) are provided to support this claim.  
   - The work is more focused on practical tools and heuristics rather than advancing the theoretical understanding of generative models, raising questions about its fit for ICLR.  
3. Evaluation Concerns:  
   - The proposed techniques are demonstrated qualitatively but lack rigorous quantitative analysis. For instance, the effectiveness of J-Diagrams or MINE grids in exposing latent space structure is not benchmarked against alternative visualization methods.  
   - The binary classification task for attribute vectors is an interesting idea, but its utility as a quantitative evaluation metric is not validated through comparisons with other evaluation methods.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Quantitative Evaluation: Include comparisons of the proposed techniques with existing methods. For instance, evaluate slerp against linear interpolation using metrics like FID or IS on generated samples. Similarly, compare the effectiveness of J-Diagrams and MINE grids with other visualization techniques.  
2. Theoretical Insights: Provide a deeper theoretical justification for the proposed techniques. For example, explain why slerp aligns better with the geometry of latent spaces and how this impacts downstream tasks quantitatively.  
3. Broader Context: Position the work more clearly within the literature. Highlight how these techniques address specific gaps or limitations in existing methods.  
4. Venue Justification: Clarify why ICLR is the appropriate venue for this work. If the focus is on practical tools, consider submitting to a conference with a stronger emphasis on applications or visualization.  
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide quantitative evidence to support the claim that slerp produces sharper samples compared to linear interpolation?  
2. How do J-Diagrams and MINE grids compare to existing visualization techniques in terms of their ability to reveal latent space structure?  
3. Could you elaborate on the potential use cases of the proposed techniques outside of image-based generative models?  
4. Why do you believe ICLR is the right venue for this work, given its lack of theoretical contributions?  
In summary, while the paper presents practical and well-explained techniques, its lack of theoretical contributions and rigorous evaluation makes it unsuitable for acceptance at ICLR in its current form. Addressing these concerns could significantly strengthen the paper.
