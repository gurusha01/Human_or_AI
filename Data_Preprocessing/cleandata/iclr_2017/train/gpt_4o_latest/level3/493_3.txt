Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes an alternative to the standard conditional maximum log-likelihood (CML) approach for training discriminative classifiers, addressing its limitations during training. Specifically, it introduces a tighter, iterative optimization framework that updates the upper bound on classification error, potentially improving classification rates. The method also extends to regularized losses and weak policy learning, offering a novel perspective by linking supervised learning to reinforcement learning. The authors provide experimental results on several datasets to validate the proposed approach and explore its implications in broader contexts, such as optimizing ROC curves and incorporating external constraints in decision-making systems.
Decision: Reject
Key reasons for rejection:
1. Preliminary and Incoherent Presentation: While the paper revisits a well-accepted methodology and presents an interesting idea, it lacks coherence and depth. The connection between weak policy learning and the main framework is underdeveloped and unclear.
2. Weak Experimental Section: The experimental results are poorly presented, with unclear figures, missing legends, and insufficient analysis. This makes it difficult to evaluate the validity of the claims.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Novelty: The paper is well-motivated, as it addresses a known limitation of CML and proposes a theoretically sound alternative. The iterative optimization framework is a novel contribution, and the connection to reinforcement learning is intriguing. However, the novelty is undermined by the lack of clarity and rigor in the presentation.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental section is a significant weakness. Figures are difficult to interpret due to missing legends and unclear axes, and the results are not thoroughly analyzed. For example, while the authors claim improvements in classification error, they do not provide sufficient statistical evidence or comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.
3. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical contributions appear sound, but the lack of detailed proofs and the limited exploration of practical implications (e.g., overfitting with T > 1) weaken the paper's impact. The discussion on regularization and its interaction with the proposed method is superficial and leaves critical questions unanswered.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity and Coherence: Strengthen the connection between the proposed framework and weak policy learning. Clearly articulate how the iterative optimization relates to broader applications, such as optimizing ROC curves or incorporating external constraints.
2. Experimental Section: Improve the presentation of results by including clear and labeled figures, comprehensive statistical analyses, and comparisons to baseline methods. Provide more details on the datasets, hyperparameter tuning, and computational complexity.
3. Depth of Analysis: Address the limitations of the proposed method more thoroughly, particularly in terms of overfitting and regularization. Explore the applicability of the approach to deep learning models, as mentioned in the discussion.
4. Writing and Organization: Improve the overall organization of the paper. For instance, the transition between sections (e.g., from supervised learning to policy optimization) is abrupt and could benefit from better framing.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed iterative framework compare to state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and classification accuracy?
2. Can you provide more detailed explanations and proofs for the theoretical claims, particularly regarding the tighter bounds and their convergence properties?
3. How does the method perform on larger, more complex datasets, especially in the context of deep learning models?
4. What specific steps were taken to address overfitting when using T > 1, and how do these compare to standard regularization techniques?
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting idea with potential, it requires significant improvements in clarity, coherence, and experimental rigor to meet the standards of the conference.
