Review
The paper introduces ENet, a lightweight neural network architecture for real-time semantic segmentation, optimized for embedded systems and mobile applications. The authors claim that ENet achieves significant improvements in speed and efficiency compared to existing models, while maintaining competitive accuracy. The network leverages known techniques such as 1-D convolutions, low-rank kernels, inception architectures, and dilated convolutions to achieve its goals. The paper evaluates ENet on multiple datasets (Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D) and benchmarks its performance on both high-end GPUs and embedded systems, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are:  
1. Lack of Novelty: The proposed techniques are well-established in the literature and have been applied to related tasks such as object detection. The paper does not introduce any fundamentally new methods or insights specific to semantic segmentation.  
2. Insufficient Analysis and Justification: The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the segmentation-specific design choices and their impact on performance or speed. Additionally, the evaluation is limited, with comparisons made only to SegNet, excluding other relevant models like DeepLab v2.
Supporting Arguments  
While the paper demonstrates practical improvements in speed and efficiency, it fails to provide a clear take-home message or novel contributions to the field. The use of known techniques, such as factorized filters and dilated convolutions, is not accompanied by a deeper exploration of how these methods are tailored to segmentation tasks. The lack of comparisons to state-of-the-art models beyond SegNet weakens the empirical claims, as it is unclear how ENet performs relative to more recent architectures. Furthermore, the discussion of results is vague, with limited insights into trade-offs or challenges encountered during development.
Additional Feedback  
To improve the paper, the authors should:  
1. Provide a more thorough analysis of the segmentation-specific design choices, including their impact on accuracy, speed, and memory usage.  
2. Expand the evaluation to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, such as DeepLab v2 or PSPNet, to better contextualize ENet's performance.  
3. Include a more detailed discussion of the results, highlighting key insights, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.  
4. Clarify the novelty of the work by emphasizing any unique contributions or innovations in the proposed architecture.  
Questions for the Authors  
1. What specific segmentation challenges (e.g., small object detection, boundary refinement) does ENet address, and how do the proposed design choices contribute to solving them?  
2. Why were comparisons limited to SegNet, and how does ENet perform against more recent models like DeepLab v2?  
3. Can the authors provide more detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual components (e.g., dilated convolutions, asymmetric filters) on performance?  
In summary, while ENet demonstrates practical utility, the lack of novelty, limited evaluation, and insufficient analysis prevent it from making a strong contribution to the field.
