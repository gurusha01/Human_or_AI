Review of the Paper: Neural Architecture Search Using Reinforcement Learning
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel method for automating the design of neural network architectures using an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework. The proposed approach treats neural networks as variable-length sequences, where node selection is modeled as actions and evaluation error serves as the reward signal. A two-layer auto-regressive LSTM is employed as the controller and critic to generate architectures. The method is evaluated on two benchmark tasks—image classification on CIFAR-10 and language modeling on Penn Treebank—and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, surpassing several human-designed architectures. The paper highlights the challenges of manual architecture design and positions its method as a promising alternative. The authors provide detailed explanations of their methodology, including improvements like skip connections and distributed training, and offer a comprehensive comparison with related work. The results are compelling, with significant improvements in test error and perplexity, and the paper is well-written and clear.

Additionally, the paper is well-positioned in the context of related literature and provides actionable insights for future research.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Impact: The use of reinforcement learning to automatically generate neural network architectures is a significant contribution. The method's ability to explore variable-length architecture spaces is a notable advancement over existing hyperparameter optimization techniques.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the method's effectiveness across diverse tasks. The results on CIFAR-10 (3.65% test error) and Penn Treebank (62.4 perplexity) are competitive with or better than state-of-the-art models, showcasing the method's generalizability.
3. Clarity and Completeness: The paper is well-organized, with detailed descriptions of the methodology, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. The inclusion of control experiments (e.g., comparison with random search) strengthens the validity of the claims.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Training Time and Resource Efficiency: While the paper mentions distributed training and asynchronous updates, it would be helpful to quantify the computational cost of the proposed method. For instance, how does the training time compare to manually designed architectures or other automated methods?
2. Human-Bootstrapped Models: The authors could explore whether initializing the search with human-designed architectures improves performance or reduces search time.
3. Broader Applicability: While the method is tested on CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank, additional experiments on larger datasets or different modalities (e.g., speech or video) could strengthen the paper's claims about generalizability.
4. Ablation Studies: An ablation study to isolate the impact of specific components (e.g., skip connections, distributed training) would provide deeper insights into the method's effectiveness.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method scale to larger datasets or more complex tasks? Are there any limitations in terms of computational resources or scalability?
2. Can the method be extended to multi-objective optimization, such as balancing accuracy with model size or inference speed?
3. How sensitive is the performance to the choice of hyperparameters for the controller RNN (e.g., learning rate, number of layers)?
4. Have you explored the interpretability of the generated architectures? Are there any patterns or insights that can inform future manual designs?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of automated machine learning and neural architecture search. Its novelty, strong empirical results, and clear presentation make it a valuable addition to the conference.
