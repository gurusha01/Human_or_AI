Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial examples in deep neural networks, focusing on both non-targeted and targeted attacks. The authors present a novel ensemble-based approach that significantly improves the transferability of targeted adversarial examples, a problem that has been underexplored in prior literature. The study is conducted on large-scale models and datasets, such as ImageNet, providing a more realistic evaluation compared to earlier works that focused on smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. Additionally, the paper demonstrates real-world attacks on a commercial black-box image classification system (Clarifai.com) and explores the geometric properties of adversarial examples. These contributions are valuable for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep learning models in real-world scenarios.
Decision: Reject
The paper has several strengths, including its novel ensemble-based approach and real-world applicability. However, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons:
1. Clarity and Length Issues: The paper is excessively long (16-24 pages) and lacks a clear, focused narrative. The abundance of results, many of which are relegated to the appendix, detracts from the clarity of the main contributions.
2. Overlap with Prior Work: The geometric understanding section overlaps with prior work (e.g., Warde-Farley and Goodfellow, 2015). The novelty of this section is not well-articulated, raising concerns about the originality of the findings.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clarity and Length: The paper's length far exceeds the recommended 8-page limit for the conference. While there is no strict page limit, the excessive length makes it difficult to discern the core contributions. For example, Section 2.2.1 could be condensed, and Table 1 could be removed without losing critical insights. Overlaying Figure 2 panels for better comparison would also improve readability.
2. Novelty Concerns: While the ensemble-based approach is innovative, the geometric analysis lacks sufficient differentiation from prior work. The authors need to clarify how their findings extend beyond Warde-Farley and Goodfellow (2015) and other related studies.
Additional Feedback
1. Real-World API Targeting: The demonstration of attacks on Clarifai.com is compelling. However, the authors should better articulate how their results advance the state of the art compared to Papernot et al. (2016). Specifically, what new insights are gained from targeting a commercial black-box system with a different label set?
2. Focus on Novel Contributions: The most novel aspect of the paper is the difficulty of adversarially manipulating images to specific desired labels. This contribution should be emphasized more prominently in the abstract and introduction.
3. Suggestions for Trimming: To improve clarity, the authors should remove redundant results, condense the methodology, and focus on the most impactful experiments. For instance, the detailed descriptions of optimization-based and fast gradient-based approaches could be summarized more succinctly.
4. Geometric Properties: The geometric analysis is interesting but underdeveloped. The authors should provide more concrete evidence to support their claims about gradient orthogonality and decision boundary alignment.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed ensemble-based approach compare to existing methods in terms of computational efficiency? Is the improved transferability achieved at the cost of significantly higher computational overhead?
2. Can the authors clarify the novelty of their geometric analysis compared to prior work? Specifically, how do their findings on gradient orthogonality and decision boundary alignment contribute new insights?
3. For the real-world attacks on Clarifai.com, how were the "semantically similar" labels evaluated? Was this assessment subjective, or was there a systematic metric used?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an important problem and introduces a novel approach, its lack of clarity, excessive length, and insufficient differentiation from prior work make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to revise and resubmit, focusing on improving clarity, emphasizing novel contributions, and addressing overlaps with existing literature.
