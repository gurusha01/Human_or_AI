Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel framework for image super-resolution (SR) based on amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference. The authors propose an innovative neural network architecture that incorporates an affine projection layer, ensuring consistency between high-resolution (HR) outputs and low-resolution (LR) inputs. This eliminates the need for paired HR-LR image datasets during certain stages of training. The framework integrates three methods for optimization: a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach, a denoiser-guided SR method, and a density-guided baseline. The GAN-based method, termed AffGAN, is shown to produce the most visually plausible results. The paper also establishes a theoretical connection between GANs and amortized variational inference, providing a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed approach.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces a novel approach and demonstrates promising results, it lacks sufficient empirical validation and clarity in critical areas. The following key reasons underpin this decision:
1. Insufficient Comparison to State-of-the-Art: The paper does not evaluate its methods on standard SR benchmark datasets (e.g., Set5, Set14, BSD100), which are widely used for fair comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. This omission makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of the proposed approach.
2. Scalability Concerns: The experiments are limited to 128Ã—128 image sizes, leaving the scalability of the framework to larger, real-world images unaddressed.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Theoretical Contributions: The introduction of the affine projection layer is a significant contribution, as it enforces consistency between HR and LR images without requiring paired datasets during certain stages. The theoretical connection between GANs and amortized variational inference is also noteworthy and could inspire future research.
2. Empirical Limitations: The lack of evaluation on standard SR datasets is a major drawback. While the results on ImageNet and CelebA are promising, they do not provide a direct comparison to existing SR methods. Furthermore, the scalability of the framework to larger images remains uncertain, as the experiments are confined to small image sizes.
3. Training Challenges: The affine projection layer requires paired HR-LR datasets for its own training, which raises questions about the practicality of the training transfer process. Additionally, the absence of a noise term in the GAN architecture limits the exploration of the HR image distribution, potentially affecting the diversity of generated solutions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Benchmark Evaluation: Include evaluations on standard SR datasets such as Set5, Set14, and BSD100 to enable fair comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
2. Scalability Testing: Extend the experiments to larger image sizes to demonstrate the framework's applicability to real-world scenarios.
3. Noise Term in GAN: Investigate the inclusion of a noise vector in the GAN framework to better model the HR image distribution and improve diversity.
4. Clarify Training Transfer: Provide more details on how the affine projection layer's training requirements align with the claim of reduced dependence on paired datasets.
5. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to quantify the individual contributions of the affine projection layer and the proposed optimization methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were standard SR benchmark datasets not included in the evaluation? How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art GAN-based SR methods on these datasets?
2. How does the framework handle larger image sizes? Are there any computational or architectural limitations that prevent its application to higher resolutions?
3. Did the authors explore the use of a noise term in the GAN architecture? If so, what were the findings, and if not, why was this omitted?
4. Can the affine projection layer be trained without paired HR-LR datasets? If so, please elaborate on the training process and its practical implications.
In conclusion, while the paper presents a novel and theoretically grounded approach to SR, the lack of comprehensive empirical validation and clarity in certain aspects limits its immediate impact. Addressing these concerns could significantly strengthen the paper for future submissions.
