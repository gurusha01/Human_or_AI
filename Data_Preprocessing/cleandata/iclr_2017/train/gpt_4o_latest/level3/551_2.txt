Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper introduces an end-to-end learnable histogram filter (E2E-HF) for state estimation in robotics, combining algorithmic priors with data-driven learning. The proposed approach encodes the structure of recursive state estimation into a differentiable framework, enabling the learning of motion and measurement models directly from data. The authors demonstrate that E2E-HFs outperform traditional histogram filters (HFs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) in terms of data efficiency and accuracy, particularly in low-data regimes. Additionally, the method supports unsupervised learning, enabling state estimation without labeled data. The paper provides a compelling proof of concept for integrating algorithmic priors with machine learning to balance data efficiency and generality.
Decision: Reject
While the paper proposes an interesting approach and demonstrates promising results, the limitations in the technical novelty, scalability, and experimental rigor prevent it from meeting the bar for acceptance. Below, I outline the key reasons for this decision and provide suggestions for improvement.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Simplistic Motion and Observation Models: The motion model assumes linear motion with Gaussian noise, which is overly simplistic for many real-world robotics applications. While this choice simplifies the implementation, it limits the generality of the approach. The observation model, while learned from data, also lacks technical novelty when generalized beyond the specific tasks presented.
   
2. Scalability Concerns: The histogram-based belief representation scales poorly with the dimensionality of the state space, as evidenced by the computational bottlenecks in the 2D drone task. This limitation significantly restricts the applicability of the method to more complex, high-dimensional robotics problems.
3. Experimental Limitations: The comparison with LSTMs is not entirely convincing, as the results suggest that LSTM performance has not saturated. Larger-scale experiments with more training data are needed to draw robust conclusions about the relative performance of E2E-HFs. Additionally, the experiments are limited to two relatively simple tasks, which do not fully demonstrate the generality of the approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Enhance Model Complexity: Explore more expressive motion and observation models, such as neural networks, to improve generality and applicability. While this may reduce the novelty of the framework, it would increase its practical relevance.
2. Address Scalability: Investigate alternative belief representations, such as particle filters or Gaussian mixtures, to improve scalability to higher-dimensional state spaces.
3. Expand Experimental Scope: Conduct experiments on more diverse and complex robotics tasks, such as 3D localization or dynamic environments, to better demonstrate the generality and robustness of the approach. Additionally, provide more detailed comparisons with baselines, ensuring that competing methods are trained to saturation.
4. Clarify Technical Contributions: Clearly articulate the technical novelty of the approach, particularly in the context of existing differentiable Bayes filters. Highlight any unique aspects of the E2E-HF framework that distinguish it from prior work.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method perform in environments with more complex dynamics or higher-dimensional state spaces? Have you considered alternative belief representations to address scalability issues?
2. Could you provide more details on the choice of the motion and observation models? Why were these specific models chosen, and how do they generalize to other robotics tasks?
3. The results suggest that LSTM performance has not saturated. Could you provide additional experiments with larger-scale training data to ensure a fair comparison?
4. How does the method handle non-Gaussian noise or multimodal distributions in the motion and observation models?
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting direction for combining algorithmic priors with machine learning, the limitations in scalability, experimental rigor, and technical novelty need to be addressed to make a stronger case for acceptance.
