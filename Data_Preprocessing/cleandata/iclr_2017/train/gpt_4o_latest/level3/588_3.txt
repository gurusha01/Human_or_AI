Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions  
This paper addresses the critical problem of detecting extreme weather events in large-scale climate simulation data. It proposes a novel 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that combines an unsupervised autoencoder loss with a YOLO-inspired bounding box prediction mechanism. The model is designed for semi-supervised learning, enabling it to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. The authors demonstrate the potential of their approach on a large-scale climate dataset, showing that temporal modeling and semi-supervised learning can improve the localization of extreme weather events. The paper is well-written, tackles an important societal problem, and provides sufficient methodological details for reproduction.
Decision: Reject  
While the paper is innovative and tackles a significant problem, it falls short in several critical areas, particularly in experimental rigor and evaluation metrics. The lack of a baseline comparison, overly lenient evaluation criteria (IoU threshold of 0.1), and insufficient discussion of key trends undermine the strength of its claims. These issues prevent the paper from meeting the scientific rigor required for acceptance.
Supporting Arguments  
1. Evaluation Concerns: The use of an IoU threshold of 0.1 for localization is too lenient and does not align with standard practices in object detection, where higher thresholds (e.g., 0.5) are typically used. The model's inability to produce variable-sized bounding boxes significantly impacts its performance at stricter IoU thresholds, as evidenced by the large drop-off in mean average precision (mAP). This limitation is acknowledged but not adequately addressed in the paper.  
2. Baseline Comparison: The absence of a baseline approach makes it difficult to contextualize the model's performance. Without a comparison to simpler methods or existing state-of-the-art techniques, it is unclear whether the proposed approach offers a meaningful improvement.  
3. Unclear Trends in Temporal Modeling: While temporal modeling shows some gains in semi-supervised settings, the trends are inconsistent and lack sufficient discussion. This weakens the claim that temporal information is critical for detecting extreme weather events.  
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Evaluation Metrics: Use stricter IoU thresholds (e.g., 0.5) as the primary evaluation metric and provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance under these conditions.  
2. Baseline Inclusion: Include comparisons with simpler or existing methods, such as 2D CNNs or heuristic-based approaches, to establish a performance baseline.  
3. Training Discrepancy: Clarify whether the 2D and 3D models were trained for equivalent durations and provide training/validation accuracy plots for comparison.  
4. Loss Weight Analysis: Discuss the impact of loss weight settings (α, β, γ) on the observed trends to provide deeper insights into the model's behavior.  
5. Surface Quantities: Clearly define what "surface quantities" refer to in the context of the 3D grid to improve clarity for readers unfamiliar with the dataset.  
6. Code Availability: While the paper provides sufficient details for reproduction, making the code publicly available would enhance reproducibility and encourage further research.  
Questions for the Authors  
1. How does the model's performance compare to simpler heuristic-based methods (e.g., TECA) or existing deep learning models for climate event detection?  
2. Can you provide additional results or visualizations for IoU thresholds above 0.1 to demonstrate the model's robustness?  
3. What steps can be taken to address the 3D CNN's difficulty in producing variable-sized bounding boxes?  
4. Did you explore the use of anchor boxes with multiple shapes and sizes to improve detection accuracy for events of varying scales?  
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting and novel approach, the lack of rigorous evaluation and baseline comparisons limits its impact. Addressing these concerns in a future revision would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions.
