The paper introduces a novel dataset derived from Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, aimed at advancing machine learning applications in theorem proving. The authors propose several machine learning tasks using this dataset, benchmark baseline models, and make the dataset publicly available under a BSD license. The dataset includes over two million training examples and nearly 200,000 testing examples, with a balanced classification task for proof step usefulness. The authors demonstrate the potential of deep learning models, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, to predict proof step usefulness with high accuracy, highlighting the promise of integrating machine learning into automated theorem proving (ATP). While the dataset is smaller than datasets in other domains (e.g., Go), it represents a critical first step in applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving.
Decision: Accept
The paper is a valuable contribution to the intersection of machine learning and automated theorem proving. Its key strengths lie in the introduction of a publicly available dataset, the benchmarking of baseline models, and the identification of promising directions for future research. These contributions provide a foundation for further exploration in this emerging field.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The dataset fills a gap in the application of machine learning to HOL theorem proving, a domain where datasets are scarce. By focusing on proof step classification, the authors address a critical bottleneck in ATP systems, making the work highly relevant to both the theorem proving and machine learning communities.
2. Baseline Models and Results: The authors provide a thorough evaluation of baseline models, demonstrating that even simple architectures achieve promising results. This establishes a benchmark for future research and underscores the potential of machine learning in this domain.
3. Broader Impact: The dataset and proposed tasks have the potential to catalyze progress in ATP, with implications for software verification, formal mathematics, and other areas requiring rigorous proof systems.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Scaling and Generalization: While the dataset is a strong starting point, its relatively small size compared to datasets in other domains may limit its impact. Future work should focus on scaling the dataset and exploring its generalizability across different theorem provers and logics.
2. Integration with State-of-the-Art ATPs: The paper would benefit from a discussion on how the proposed models could be integrated into existing ATP systems, such as Vampire or E, to improve their performance.
3. Logical Reasoning in Models: The authors acknowledge that their models rely on pattern matching rather than logical reasoning. Future work should explore architectures capable of explicit reasoning, such as graph-based neural networks or hybrid systems combining symbolic and neural approaches.
4. Evaluation Metrics: While the accuracy results are promising, additional evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) could provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance, especially in practical ATP applications.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the dataset handle the inherent bias introduced by human-curated proofs? Could this limit the applicability of the models to purely automated proofs?
2. Have you considered using graph-based neural networks or other architectures that explicitly model the logical structure of HOL statements?
3. How do you envision the dataset being extended to support tasks beyond proof step classification, such as theorem generation or strategy selection?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field and lays the groundwork for future advancements in machine learning-based theorem proving. While there are areas for improvement, the work is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and impactful, warranting acceptance.
