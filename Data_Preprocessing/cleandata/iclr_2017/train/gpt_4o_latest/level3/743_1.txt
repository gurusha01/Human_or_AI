Review of the Paper
The paper investigates the concept of "universality" in halting time distributions for optimization algorithms, focusing on whether rescaled halting time distributions are independent of stopping parameters, dimensionality, and ensemble. The authors provide empirical evidence for two universality classes—Gumbel-like and Gaussian-like distributions—across a variety of optimization settings, including spin glasses, deep learning, and the QR algorithm. This exploration is theoretically intriguing and contributes to understanding the statistical properties of halting times in optimization processes. The work also highlights the potential benefits of universality as a measure of algorithm stability and robustness, which could have implications for algorithm design and tuning.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses a theoretically interesting problem, it falls short in several critical areas. The primary reasons for rejection are: (1) the lack of practical relevance and broader applicability of the results, and (2) significant clarity and presentation issues that hinder comprehension.
Supporting Arguments
1. Theoretical vs. Practical Relevance: While the concept of universality in halting time distributions is intriguing, its practical utility is limited. Most real-world applications prioritize actual stopping times rather than scaled distributions. The paper does not convincingly argue how this theoretical insight could translate into actionable benefits for practitioners in machine learning or optimization.
2. Missed Opportunities for Comparison: The paper would have been significantly more impactful if it had compared halting time distributions across commonly used optimization methods (e.g., SGD, momentum, ADAM) and deep learning architectures. This would have provided practical insights into how universality manifests in real-world scenarios.
3. Clarity Issues: The paper suffers from poor clarity in its abstract, introduction, and mathematical formulations. Key terms like "input," "dimension," "epsilon," and "ensemble" are not clearly defined. The introduction contains confusing phrasing, such as equating a stopping condition with time, which detracts from the reader's understanding. Additionally, the mathematical notations (e.g., Z, M) are inadequately explained, making the technical content difficult to follow.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Explore Initialization Effects: The influence of initialization on halting time distributions, particularly its potential to reduce the right tail, is an important but unexplored aspect. Addressing this could provide valuable insights into the role of initialization in optimization.
2. Broader Contextualization: The paper should better situate its contributions within the broader literature. For example, discussing how universality could guide hyperparameter tuning or algorithm selection would make the work more relevant to the ICLR audience.
3. Improve Presentation: The abstract and introduction should be revised for clarity and precision. Avoid vague terms and ensure that all key parameters are clearly defined. Additionally, the mathematical exposition should be made more accessible, with detailed explanations of notations and assumptions.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you envision the practical applications of universality in halting time distributions? Can you provide specific scenarios where this insight would be beneficial?
2. Why were comparisons across optimization methods (e.g., SGD vs. ADAM) and architectures not included? Would such comparisons reveal additional insights about universality?
3. Have you considered the role of initialization in shaping halting time distributions? If so, what are your preliminary findings?
In summary, while the paper tackles an interesting theoretical question, its limited practical relevance, lack of comparative analysis, and clarity issues make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing these concerns could significantly enhance its impact and accessibility.
