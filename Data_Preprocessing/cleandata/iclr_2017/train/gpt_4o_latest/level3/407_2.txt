Review of "A2T: Attend, Adapt, and Transfer - An Attentive Deep Architecture for Adaptive Transfer"
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the challenges of transfer reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on avoiding negative transfer and enabling selective transfer between tasks. The authors propose the A2T (Attend, Adapt, and Transfer) framework, which employs a deep attention mechanism to dynamically combine solutions from multiple source tasks and a base network trained on the target task. The framework ensures that transfer is state-specific, allowing selective use of source task solutions while avoiding negative transfer. The method is applied to both policy transfer and value transfer, with implementations for REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms. Experiments conducted on Chain World, Puddle World, and Atari games (e.g., Pong) demonstrate the framework's ability to accelerate learning and adaptively leverage diverse source tasks. The paper also explores scenarios with unfavorable source tasks, showing that A2T can effectively ignore negative experts while benefiting from favorable ones.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a novel and promising approach to transfer reinforcement learning, it falls short in some critical areas that limit its impact and general applicability. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Limited General Applicability: The paper does not explore scenarios where the algorithm operates without a base network, which restricts its utility in settings where no prior knowledge is available.
2. Inconsistent Performance Gains: Although A2T accelerates learning, it does not consistently outperform the solo base network in terms of overall performance, raising questions about its practical advantages.
Supporting Arguments
1. Specific Problem Tackled: The paper addresses the important problem of avoiding negative transfer and enabling selective transfer in reinforcement learning. This is a well-motivated problem, as negative transfer can significantly hinder learning in real-world applications.
2. Novelty and Motivation: The use of a deep attention mechanism for selective transfer is novel and well-placed in the literature. The paper builds on prior work in transfer learning, such as Progressive Neural Networks and multi-task learning, and extends these ideas with state-specific attention.
3. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are well-designed and demonstrate the effectiveness of A2T in various settings. The visualization of attention weights and the ability to handle negative experts are particularly compelling. However, the reliance on pre-trained source tasks and the base network limits the generalizability of the approach.
4. Inconsistent Results: While A2T accelerates learning, it does not consistently outperform the base network in terms of final performance. This undermines its utility in scenarios where training speed is not the primary concern.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Applicability: Explore scenarios where A2T operates without a base network or with minimal prior knowledge. This would make the approach more general and applicable to a wider range of tasks.
2. Stronger Empirical Evidence: Provide more convincing examples where the complementary benefits of source tasks significantly enhance the base network's performance. For example, demonstrate cases where A2T outperforms both the base network and individual source tasks in final performance.
3. Theoretical Insights: Include a deeper theoretical analysis of the attention mechanism, particularly its ability to balance exploration and exploitation when combining source task solutions.
4. Comparison with Ensembles: Since A2T can be interpreted as a form of ensemble reinforcement learning, a direct comparison with ensemble methods would strengthen the paper's contributions.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does A2T perform in settings where no base network is available, and the agent must rely solely on source tasks?
2. Can the attention mechanism handle tasks with different state-action spaces, or is it limited to tasks within the same domain?
3. Could you provide more quantitative evidence of the complementary benefits of source tasks, particularly in complex environments like Atari games?
In conclusion, while A2T is a promising framework with strong experimental results, its limited generalizability and inconsistent performance gains warrant further refinement before acceptance. The suggestions provided aim to help the authors strengthen their work for future submissions.
