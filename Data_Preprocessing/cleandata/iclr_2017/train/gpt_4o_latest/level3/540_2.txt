Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper addresses the problem of network morphism, specifically at the module level, and proposes a novel graph-based abstraction to morph a convolutional layer into an arbitrary module. The authors introduce two atomic morphing operations and classify modules into simple morphable and complex modules, providing algorithms for both. The theoretical contributions include proving that any reasonable module can be morphed from a single convolutional layer and demonstrating the generalization ability of the proposed approach. Experimental results on ResNet architectures show significant performance improvements on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets. The paper highlights the potential of network morphism as a tool for architecture exploration and performance enhancement.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting and theoretically sound approach to network morphism, it falls short in several critical areas that limit its contribution and broader applicability. The key reasons for rejection are:
1. Limited Scope of Experiments: The experiments are primarily conducted on small datasets (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and older architectures (ResNet). The lack of evaluation on larger datasets like ImageNet and newer architectures such as Xception or DenseNet raises concerns about the generalizability and production usability of the proposed method.
2. Insufficient Practical Details: The paper does not provide adequate information about the computational time and effort required for the proposed morphing techniques, making it difficult to assess their practicality in real-world scenarios.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Dataset and Architecture Coverage: While the results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are promising, these datasets are relatively small and may not reflect the challenges of larger, more complex datasets like ImageNet. The absence of experiments on modern architectures like DenseNet or Xception further weakens the claim of general applicability.
2. Lack of Computational Analysis: The paper claims minimal computational overhead but does not provide quantitative metrics or detailed analysis of the computational cost involved in the morphing process. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the trade-offs between performance improvement and computational expense.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Scope: To strengthen the paper, the authors should test their approach on larger datasets like ImageNet and include results for newer architectures such as DenseNet, Xception, or EfficientNet. This would demonstrate the broader applicability of the method.
2. Provide Computational Metrics: Include detailed metrics on computational time, memory usage, and training effort for the morphing process. This would help assess the practicality of the proposed approach.
3. Clarify Practical Implications: While the theoretical contributions are strong, the paper should better articulate the practical implications of the work, especially in terms of deployment in real-world systems.
4. Address Scalability: The authors should discuss how the proposed method scales with increasing network depth and dataset size, as this is critical for its adoption in production environments.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on larger datasets like ImageNet when compared to state-of-the-art architectures such as DenseNet or Xception?
2. What is the computational cost (in terms of time and resources) of the morphing process, and how does it scale with network depth and dataset size?
3. Can the proposed approach handle non-convolutional layers (e.g., attention mechanisms) or hybrid architectures effectively?
In conclusion, while the paper makes a valuable theoretical contribution to the field of network morphism, its limitations in experimental validation and practical details prevent it from being ready for acceptance at this stage. Addressing the outlined concerns could significantly enhance the paper's impact and relevance.
