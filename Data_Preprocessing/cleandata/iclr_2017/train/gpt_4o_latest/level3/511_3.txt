Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel algorithm that leverages neural networks for approximating solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE). The authors propose a recursive bootstrapping approach where the neural network serves dual roles: as a function approximator and as a data generator. The method is validated through three distinct experiments involving linear systems and pursuit-evasion games, demonstrating its ability to approximate solutions with reasonable accuracy. The paper highlights the advantages of the proposed method, such as reduced memory requirements compared to gridding techniques, and its potential scalability to higher-dimensional problems. The authors also discuss limitations, including the need for hyperparameter tuning and longer computation times for low-dimensional systems.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting approach and demonstrates promising results, it has significant shortcomings that limit its contribution to the field. The primary reasons for rejection are (1) the lack of generalizability of the method to other PDE types and (2) insufficient exploration of scalability and sensitivity to domain size, which are critical for practical applicability. Additionally, the paper assumes familiarity with the HJI PDE, making it less accessible to a broader audience.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Generality and Applicability: The method is tailored specifically to the HJI PDE, and the paper does not explore its applicability to other types of PDEs, such as diffusion or wave equations. This limits the broader impact of the work.
2. Scalability and Sensitivity: The experiments are restricted to a single domain size (51x51), and the paper does not investigate how the method performs with larger domains or higher-dimensional problems. This raises concerns about the robustness and scalability of the approach.
3. Practicality: Training a separate neural network for each domain, function, or boundary condition is computationally expensive and impractical for real-world applications. The authors do not propose or explore a more generalizable framework that could address this limitation.
4. Accessibility: The paper assumes familiarity with the HJI PDE, which may alienate readers unfamiliar with this specific PDE. Including an appendix to introduce the HJI PDE would improve accessibility.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Generalization to Other PDEs: The authors should explore whether their method can be extended to other PDE types, such as diffusion or wave equations, to demonstrate its broader applicability.
2. Scalability Analysis: Conduct experiments on larger domains and higher-dimensional systems to assess the method's scalability and sensitivity to domain size.
3. Generalizable Framework: Investigate approaches to train a single neural network that can generalize across multiple domains, boundary conditions, or PDE types.
4. Appendix on HJI PDE: Add an appendix providing an accessible introduction to the HJI PDE, including its relevance and key concepts, to make the paper more approachable for a wider audience.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform on larger domains or higher-dimensional systems? Does the error increase significantly with domain size or dimensionality?
2. Can the approach be extended to other types of PDEs, such as diffusion or wave equations? If not, what are the fundamental limitations?
3. Have you considered methods to train a single neural network that generalizes across multiple domains or boundary conditions? If so, what challenges did you encounter?
4. Could you provide more details on the computational efficiency of your method compared to state-of-the-art tools, especially for higher-dimensional problems?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an innovative approach, addressing the above concerns would significantly enhance its impact and relevance to the broader scientific community.
