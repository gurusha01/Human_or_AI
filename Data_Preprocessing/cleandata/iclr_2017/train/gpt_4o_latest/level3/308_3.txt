The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the challenges of training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), focusing on instability and saturation issues. It introduces a smoothening approach to address these problems, supported by rigorous mathematical analysis and targeted experiments. The authors leverage advanced concepts from differential topology and divergence functions to explain the sources of instability and propose a novel framework for mitigating these issues. The paper also suggests a practical solution that incorporates noise to smooth distributions, enabling stable training dynamics and interpretable gradients.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for this decision are the paper's strong theoretical contributions and its potential to advance our understanding of GAN training dynamics. The authors address a critical problem in the field, providing not only a detailed theoretical framework but also a practical direction for improving GAN stability. The use of smoothened metrics and noise injection is both innovative and well-motivated, with clear implications for future research.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Theoretical Contributions: The paper provides a rigorous analysis of GAN instability using tools from differential topology and divergence measures. The proofs are detailed and mathematically sound, addressing fundamental questions about the training dynamics of GANs.
2. Practical Relevance: The proposed smoothening approach is intuitive and addresses key issues such as vanishing gradients and instability. By introducing noise to smooth distributions, the authors provide a feasible solution that can be implemented in practice.
3. Clarity of Results: The paper supports its claims with targeted experiments that validate the theoretical assumptions and quantify the phenomena discussed.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Length and Accessibility: The paper is overly technical and lengthy, which may limit its accessibility to a broader audience. Section 2.1, in particular, could be shortened by moving detailed proofs to the appendix, as suggested in the guidelines.
2. Clarity of Theorems: Some theorems and assumptions require additional clarification, particularly regarding the domains of random variables and the practical implications of the results. The numbering of theorems is also confusing and should be revised for better readability.
3. Minor Corrections: There are minor grammatical and phrasing issues (e.g., "relly" should be "rely," "Therefore" should be "Then") that need to be addressed. Additionally, theorem references should be checked for consistency.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Could you provide more intuition or examples to explain the practical implications of Theorem 3.3 and its relationship to the Wasserstein metric?
2. How sensitive is the proposed smoothening approach to the choice of noise distribution and its variance? Are there guidelines for selecting these parameters?
3. Have you considered the computational overhead introduced by the noise injection and smoothened metrics? If so, how does it compare to standard GAN training?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of GAN training and offers a promising direction for addressing instability issues. With minor revisions to improve clarity and accessibility, it will be a valuable addition to the conference.
