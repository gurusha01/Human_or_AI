The paper introduces a novel approach to macroscopic knowledge transfer by addressing the problem of network morphism at the module level, rather than the layer level, as in prior work. The authors propose a graph-based abstraction to represent modules as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a framework for modular network morphism using atomic operations. They prove that any convolutional layer can be morphed into an arbitrary module and provide practical algorithms for both simple and complex module transformations. Experimental results on ResNet variants demonstrate performance improvements on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, showcasing the potential of the proposed method.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting problem and proposes a theoretically sound solution, the experimental results and positioning within the literature are insufficient to justify acceptance. The key reasons for this decision are: (1) the lack of clarity regarding the source of performance improvements in the experiments, and (2) the absence of comparative results demonstrating the speedup and model exploration advantages over existing knowledge transfer methods like Net2Net and NetMorph.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses an important problem in knowledge transfer and extends network morphism to the module level, which is a significant conceptual advancement. The use of graph-based abstraction and atomic operations is well-motivated and theoretically sound.
2. Experimental Results: While the experiments on ResNet variants show improved error rates, the source of these improvements is unclear. It is not evident whether the gains are due to the proposed morphing process, better initialization, or other factors. Furthermore, the experiments focus only on simple module transformations, limiting the demonstration of the method's full potential.
3. Positioning in Literature: The "Related Work" section uses the term "network morphism" instead of "knowledge transfer," which misaligns the paper with broader literature. Additionally, the paper does not compare its method against other knowledge transfer approaches like Net2Net and NetMorph in terms of speedup or architectural exploration, which are critical claims of the proposed method.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify the Source of Improvements: Provide detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the proposed morphing process from other factors, such as initialization or architectural changes.
2. Broaden Experimental Scope: Include experiments that demonstrate the method's ability to handle complex module transformations, as claimed in the theoretical analysis.
3. Comparative Analysis: Include comparisons with existing knowledge transfer methods like Net2Net and NetMorph to substantiate claims about speedup and model exploration advantages.
4. Terminology Alignment: Revise the "Related Work" section to use the term "knowledge transfer" and better situate the work within the broader literature.
Questions for the Authors:
1. What specific factors contribute to the observed performance improvements in the experiments? Can these be isolated through ablation studies?
2. Why were experiments on complex module transformations omitted, despite the theoretical capability to handle them?
3. How does the proposed method compare to Net2Net and NetMorph in terms of computational speedup and architectural exploration efficiency?
In summary, while the paper presents a novel and theoretically sound approach, it requires stronger experimental validation and better integration with existing literature to make a compelling case for acceptance.
