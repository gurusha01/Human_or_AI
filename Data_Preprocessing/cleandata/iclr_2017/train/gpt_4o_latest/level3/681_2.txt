Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes three key improvements to scattering networks: (1) a new non-linearity for Fourier-domain computation, (2) compact Fourier-domain representations, and (3) additional variance-based invariant features. The authors claim that these contributions enable faster computations (linear complexity in input size) and enhanced discriminative power for machine learning tasks, particularly in audio classification. The paper validates its approach on a bird song classification dataset, achieving near state-of-the-art results without extensive parameter tuning or feature engineering. The authors also emphasize the scalability and memory efficiency of their framework, which is derived entirely in the Fourier domain.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons:
1. Lack of Clarity and Rigor in Explanations: The paper's writing is unclear, with convoluted sentences and overly complex equations (e.g., Eq. 5 and Eq. 14). This makes it difficult to follow the technical details and evaluate the contributions effectively. Additionally, claims about invariants and fundamental structures lack sufficient mathematical justification.
2. Insufficient Evaluation and Substantiation: While the proposed features are validated on a bird song classification task, the evaluation is limited and does not convincingly demonstrate the claimed improvements in speed and accuracy. The theoretical arguments, particularly around cardinality (Eq. 14), are weak and require stronger support.
Supporting Arguments
1. Writing and Presentation Issues: The paper suffers from unclear writing, particularly in Section 1, where long and obfuscated sentences hinder comprehension. Many equations are unnecessarily complex, with excessive indexing and hyperparameter dependencies. For instance, Eq. 5 could be simplified to improve readability without losing its essence.
2. Weak Theoretical Justifications: The argument for the cardinality of the proposed features (Eq. 14) is unconvincing and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. Similarly, claims about invariants and fundamental structures are not adequately substantiated with mathematical rigor.
3. Limited Empirical Validation: The bird song classification task is the sole empirical validation presented, and while the results are promising, they are not sufficient to generalize the claims about the framework's efficiency and accuracy. The lack of comparisons with other feature extraction methods or ablation studies further weakens the evaluation.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Improve Clarity and Simplify Equations: Rewrite the paper with a focus on clarity and conciseness. Simplify equations where possible and provide intuitive explanations for key concepts. For example, Eq. 5 and Eq. 14 should be revised to reduce unnecessary complexity.
2. Strengthen Theoretical Foundations: Provide rigorous mathematical proofs or arguments to support claims about invariants, cardinality, and fundamental structures. This is particularly important for Eq. 14 and the variance-based features.
3. Expand Empirical Evaluation: Validate the proposed framework on additional datasets and tasks to demonstrate its generalizability. Include comparisons with other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each proposed improvement.
4. Clarify Feature-Building Approach: The feature-building process appears heuristic and lacks guarantees. The authors should provide a more rigorous justification for their approach and discuss its limitations.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed second-order non-linearity compare to the complex modulus in terms of sparsity and discriminative power? Can you provide quantitative evidence to support this?
2. Can you clarify the theoretical basis for Eq. 14? How does the addition of variance-based features improve the cardinality of the feature set?
3. Have you considered validating your framework on other tasks or datasets beyond bird song classification? If not, why?
4. How do the proposed features compare to learned features from deep neural networks in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
While the paper introduces interesting ideas, the lack of clarity, rigor, and comprehensive evaluation prevents it from meeting the standards required for acceptance. The authors are encouraged to address these issues and resubmit after significant revisions.
