Review of the Paper
The paper addresses the critical issue of instability in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a focus on mode collapse, by proposing a novel method that allows the generator to anticipate the discriminator's evolving decision boundary through unrolled optimization. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical GAN objectives and practical training dynamics, offering a more elegant solution compared to existing stabilization techniques. The authors provide extensive experimental evidence across various datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in improving stability and diversity in GAN training.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons for Acceptance:
1. Significant Contribution: The paper tackles a well-known and important problem in GAN training—instability and mode collapse—and proposes a theoretically grounded and practically effective solution.
2. Strong Experimental Validation: The authors present compelling empirical results across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and synthetic data, to support their claims. The experiments demonstrate improved mode coverage, reduced oscillations, and enhanced stability.
3. Elegance of the Approach: The proposed unrolled optimization method is conceptually elegant and avoids ad-hoc "hacks" often used in GAN training, contributing to the broader understanding of GAN dynamics.
Supporting Arguments:
- The paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed method, its theoretical underpinnings, and its practical implications.
- The experimental results are thorough and include both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, such as mode coverage, JS divergence, and pairwise distance distributions, which collectively validate the method's effectiveness.
- The authors acknowledge the computational cost of unrolling but provide a balanced discussion of the trade-offs and scenarios where the method is most beneficial.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Reproducibility Concerns: The reviewer faced difficulties reproducing results on MNIST using a fully connected network. This suggests potential dependencies on specific architectures or techniques (e.g., batch normalization). The authors should explicitly discuss these dependencies and provide guidance for reproducing results across different setups.
2. Alternative Approaches: The paper would benefit from a more detailed comparison with alternative stabilization techniques, such as extended discriminator training or historical averaging. While the authors briefly mention these, a deeper analysis could strengthen the argument for their method.
3. Scalability: The computational overhead of unrolling increases linearly with the number of steps. The authors could explore strategies to mitigate this cost, such as approximations or adaptive unrolling strategies, and discuss their potential impact on performance.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Could the observed benefits of unrolling be achieved by simply training the discriminator for more steps before updating the generator? How does the proposed method compare to this alternative in terms of computational cost and performance?
2. To what extent does the method rely on specific architectural choices (e.g., convolutional networks, batch normalization)? Would the approach generalize to other types of generators and discriminators, such as fully connected networks or transformers?
3. Have the authors considered unrolling the generator's optimization as well, or unrolling sequences of generator and discriminator updates? If so, what were the results?
Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of GAN research by addressing a fundamental challenge with a theoretically sound and empirically validated approach. With minor clarifications and additional discussion, the paper will be a valuable addition to the conference.
