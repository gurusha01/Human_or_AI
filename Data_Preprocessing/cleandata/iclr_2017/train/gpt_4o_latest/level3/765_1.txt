Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel extension to an existing neural network architecture for video frame prediction by incorporating a reward-predicting head. The proposed model jointly predicts future video frames and cumulative rewards in high-dimensional visual environments, specifically in the context of Atari games. The authors demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through empirical evaluations on five games, showcasing accurate cumulative reward predictions up to 200 frames. The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and provides a detailed analysis of both quantitative and qualitative results. The work is positioned as a step toward more data-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) in complex environments where both system dynamics and reward structures are initially unknown.
Decision: Reject
While the paper makes a modest contribution, the novelty of the proposed model is incremental. The addition of a reward-predicting head to an existing architecture does not constitute a substantial advancement in the field. The results, while promising, serve more as a proof of concept rather than a significant leap forward. The paper lays the groundwork for future research but lacks the depth and innovation required for acceptance at a top-tier AI conference.
Supporting Arguments
1. Incremental Contribution: The primary innovation—adding a reward-predicting head—is a straightforward extension of prior work (Oh et al., 2015). While the integration of reward prediction is useful, it does not introduce fundamentally new methodologies or insights into model-based RL.
   
2. Limited Scope: The model is evaluated on a small set of Atari games, which, while standard in RL research, limits the generalizability of the findings. The results are promising but do not convincingly demonstrate the scalability or applicability of the approach to more complex or real-world environments.
3. Preliminary Nature: The paper feels more like a foundational study for future work rather than a complete contribution. The authors themselves acknowledge several limitations, such as the inability to handle non-deterministic state transitions effectively and the need for further improvements in prediction performance.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Evaluation: Expanding the evaluation to include more diverse environments, such as those with non-deterministic dynamics or sparse rewards, would strengthen the paper's claims. Incorporating experiments in more complex domains, like 3D environments or real-world robotics, could demonstrate the model's broader applicability.
2. Comparative Analysis: A more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches would provide better context for the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses. For example, how does this approach compare to recent advances in planning with learned models or hybrid model-based/model-free techniques?
3. Theoretical Insights: Beyond empirical results, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of why the joint prediction of frames and rewards is effective. For instance, exploring how the shared latent representation facilitates learning or planning could provide valuable insights.
4. Addressing Stochasticity: The paper highlights issues with non-deterministic transitions but does not propose concrete solutions. Incorporating techniques like variational autoencoders or probabilistic modeling could be a promising direction to address this limitation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed model perform in environments with sparse rewards or highly stochastic transitions? Would the addition of the reward-predicting head still be effective in such scenarios?
2. Have you considered integrating the model with planning algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to demonstrate its utility in decision-making tasks?
3. Could the compound loss function be further refined to balance frame and reward prediction more effectively, especially in games like Seaquest where stochasticity impacts performance?
In conclusion, while the paper demonstrates a promising direction for model-based RL, its incremental nature and limited scope prevent it from meeting the bar for acceptance. The authors are encouraged to build on this foundation by addressing the outlined limitations and exploring more ambitious applications.
