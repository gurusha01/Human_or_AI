Review
This paper introduces a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to improve long-term predictions in game environments. The authors address key limitations of prior methods, such as computational inefficiency and challenges in predicting many time-steps ahead, by proposing a model that can jump directly to future states without generating high-dimensional images at each step. The paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, including Atari games, a 3D car racing simulator, and 3D maze exploration. The results show significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, with additional qualitative insights provided through human-interactive simulations.
The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology, training schemes, and experimental results. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between short-term and long-term prediction accuracy, offering valuable insights into the design of training schemes and model architectures. The inclusion of 3D maze exploration as a testbed adds practical value, showcasing the model's ability to handle partially observable environments and spatial coherence.

2. Rigorous Evaluation: The extensive experimental evaluation across diverse environments, including human-interactive tests, convincingly supports the claims made in the paper.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance: The paper tackles a well-motivated problem in simulating environment dynamics, which is central to reinforcement learning and decision-making systems. The authors clearly position their work within the existing literature, building on and improving the state-of-the-art.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple environments with varying levels of complexity. The results demonstrate the model's adaptability and robustness, with detailed analyses of training schemes and architectural choices.
3. Practical Utility: The application to 3D maze exploration and the demonstrated ability to improve exploration strategies highlight the practical relevance of the proposed approach.
Additional Feedback
1. Citations: The paper should include references to prior work on "jumpy predictions in low-dimensional observation spaces," as this would strengthen the discussion of related literature.
2. Clarity: While the explanations are generally clear, the section on training schemes could benefit from a more concise summary of the key findings to improve readability.
3. Typos: Fix the typo in Section 3.1: "this configuration is all experiments" should be corrected for clarity.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform in environments with stochastic dynamics, given that it is designed for deterministic settings? Are there plans to extend the approach to handle noise or uncertainty in state transitions?
2. Could the authors elaborate on the computational trade-offs of using higher-dimensional state representations (e.g., 2816 vs. 1024) in terms of training time and memory requirements?
3. In the 3D maze exploration task, how does the proposed exploration strategy compare quantitatively to other state-of-the-art exploration methods, such as intrinsic motivation or curiosity-driven approaches?
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is a valuable addition to the conference. The proposed model and its extensive evaluation set a solid foundation for future work in long-term environment simulation and planning.
