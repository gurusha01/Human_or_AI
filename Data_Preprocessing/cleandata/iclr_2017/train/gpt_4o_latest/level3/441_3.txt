Review of the Paper
Summary
This paper introduces Variable Computation RNN (VCRNN) and Variable Computation GRU (VCGRU), novel recurrent neural network architectures that dynamically adjust the amount of computation performed at each time step. The proposed models aim to address the inefficiencies of constant computation in traditional RNNs by allowing the network to allocate computational resources based on the input and hidden state. The authors demonstrate that these architectures achieve better performance on sequence modeling tasks while reducing the number of operations. Additionally, the models provide interpretability through the computational allocation parameter \(m_t\), which highlights task-relevant time patterns. The paper includes experiments on music modeling, bit-level and character-level language modeling, and multilingual datasets, showcasing the models' ability to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to varying time scales.
Decision: Accept
The paper is a strong contribution to the field of adaptive computation in RNNs. Its novelty, interpretability, and promising experimental results outweigh the concerns regarding computational efficiency claims and baseline comparisons. However, revisions are needed to improve clarity and address certain weaknesses.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Originality: The proposed architectures are inventive, introducing a dynamic computation mechanism that is distinct from existing methods. This approach is well-motivated and addresses a meaningful gap in the literature.
2. Performance: The models outperform vanilla RNNs and achieve comparable or better results than GRUs and LSTMs in some tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness. The interpretability of \(m_t\) adds significant value, offering insights into task difficulty and temporal dependencies.
3. Visualization Insights: The visualizations convincingly show that the models allocate more computational resources to key points, such as word boundaries or fast musical passages, aligning with intuitive expectations.
4. Revisions and Improvements: The authors addressed key concerns raised during the review process, such as adding stronger baselines (e.g., GRU and LSTM) and clarifying experimental details.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Experimental Clarity: The paper lacks sufficient details on hyperparameter selection and baseline tuning. For example, it is unclear whether the baselines were optimized to the same extent as the proposed models. Providing this information would strengthen the empirical rigor.
2. Computational Efficiency Claims: While the models conceptually reduce the number of operations, the absence of wall-clock time measurements undermines claims of practical efficiency. Future work should include hardware-level benchmarks to validate these claims.
3. Impact on State-of-the-Art (SOTA): Although the results are promising, they do not significantly surpass the SOTA on some tasks. The authors should explicitly discuss the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance compared to SOTA models.
4. Practical Feasibility: The paper does not address whether the proposed architectures can be efficiently implemented on modern hardware (e.g., GPUs). This is a critical consideration for real-world adoption.
Questions for the Authors
1. How were the baseline models (e.g., GRU, LSTM) tuned, and were they optimized to the same extent as the proposed models?
2. Can you provide wall-clock time measurements to validate the computational efficiency claims? How do the models perform on GPUs or TPUs?
3. Have you considered extending the approach to multi-layer architectures or other recurrent units like LSTMs? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
4. Could the interpretability of \(m_t\) be further quantified or leveraged for downstream tasks, such as identifying anomalies in time-series data?
In conclusion, this paper presents a compelling contribution to adaptive computation in RNNs, with strong theoretical and empirical foundations. Addressing the outlined concerns would further enhance its impact and practical relevance.
