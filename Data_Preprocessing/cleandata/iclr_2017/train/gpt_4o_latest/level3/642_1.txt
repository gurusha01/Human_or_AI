Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the impact of customized numeric representations, specifically fixed-point and floating-point formats, on the accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) inference. The authors evaluate these representations on production-grade architectures like GoogLeNet and VGG, demonstrating that floating-point representations with reduced bit widths (e.g., 14–17 bits) outperform fixed-point formats in terms of efficiency and accuracy trade-offs. A novel search method for determining optimal precision configurations is proposed, leveraging the last-layer activations to predict accuracy, significantly reducing search time compared to exhaustive evaluation. The study highlights the potential for hardware speedups of up to 7.6× with less than 1% accuracy degradation, providing valuable insights for DNN hardware design.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to an underexplored area of DNN hardware optimization, demonstrating scientific rigor in its experiments and offering actionable insights for hardware designers. The results are well-supported by empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art DNNs, and the proposed search method addresses a practical challenge in customized precision design.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Relevance and Novelty: The paper addresses a critical and underexplored problem—optimizing numeric representations for DNN inference. Unlike prior work, which focused on small-scale networks and fixed-point formats, this study evaluates large, real-world DNNs and demonstrates the superiority of floating-point representations in this context.
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple DNN architectures and metrics (accuracy, speed, energy). The methodology is clearly described, and the results are robust, showing consistent trends across networks.
3. Practical Impact: The findings have direct implications for hardware designers, challenging the conventional preference for fixed-point arithmetic and advocating for narrow-precision floating-point formats. The proposed search method is efficient and scalable, making it feasible for real-world applications.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Scope: The paper should explicitly state that it focuses solely on inference, not training, as training dynamics may differ significantly. Additionally, discussing the potential benefits of incorporating quantization techniques during training to further optimize inference would strengthen the narrative.
2. Simulation Details: It is unclear whether the reported speedup and energy savings include all hardware modules or are limited to multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. Clarifying this and providing more details on the simulation setup would improve transparency.
3. Efficient Precision Search: While the proposed search method is novel, the discussion on its efficiency could be expanded. The claim that exhaustive search with parallelization may be more effective in some cases warrants further exploration or justification.
4. Hardware Context: The paper should discuss Nvidia's Pascal GP100 GPU's FP16 support and cite relevant Nvidia documentation to contextualize its findings within existing hardware capabilities.
5. Future Work: The authors could explore the impact of customized precision on other DNN components, such as batch normalization and recurrent neural networks, in future studies.
Questions for Authors
1. Does the reported speedup and energy consumption include all hardware modules (e.g., memory access, control logic) or just MAC units? If the latter, how do these results generalize to full-system performance?
2. How does the proposed precision search method compare to exhaustive search in terms of computational cost for larger DNNs like GPT or Vision Transformers?
3. Can the proposed method be extended to multi-precision configurations, where different layers use different numeric representations? If not, what are the key challenges?
Overall, this paper provides a solid contribution to the field of DNN hardware optimization and is well-suited for acceptance with minor clarifications and improvements.
