Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel nonlinear dynamical model, termed Relational Dynamic model with Gaussian representations (RDG), for forecasting multiple related multivariate time series. The model is designed to capture both temporal intra-series and relational inter-series dependencies, leveraging Gaussian embeddings in a latent space. It incorporates a linear observation model, a dynamical model for latent variables, and a similarity constraint between time series, which is informed by a predefined graph structure. The model is evaluated on four datasets and compared against several baselines, including auto-regressive models, feed-forward networks, RNNs, and dynamic factor graphs (DFGs). Notably, RDG demonstrates competitive performance and provides uncertainty estimates for predictions, a feature absent in many baselines.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting approach and demonstrates promising results, it has several critical shortcomings that limit its contribution and reproducibility. These include insufficient placement in the broader literature, limited evaluation on small datasets, and a lack of clarity in model architecture and computational complexity.
Supporting Arguments
1. Literature Placement: The paper does not adequately situate its contributions in the context of related work. While it mentions variational inference and Gaussian embeddings, it fails to reference key works on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and deep Gaussian models, which also predict mean and variance. This omission weakens the paper's claim of novelty and leaves the impression of incomplete scholarship.
   
2. Evaluation Limitations: The datasets used for evaluation are small, leading to high variance in results. This is particularly concerning given the model's focus on uncertainty estimation, as small datasets may not provide robust evidence of its reliability. Additionally, the paper does not explore the model's performance on longer time series, which would better demonstrate its scalability and practical applicability.
3. Model Details and Complexity: The paper lacks sufficient details about the model architecture, particularly the design of the decoder and dynamical components. Furthermore, it does not provide a comparison of time complexity with baselines, leaving open questions about the computational feasibility of RDG for large-scale datasets.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Literature Review: Include references to variational auto-encoders and deep Gaussian models, and clarify how RDG differs from or improves upon these approaches.
2. Broader Evaluation: Conduct experiments on larger and more diverse datasets, including longer time series, to validate the model's robustness and scalability.
3. Model and Complexity Details: Provide a more detailed description of the model architecture, including the specific design choices for the decoder and dynamical components. Additionally, include a time complexity analysis to compare RDG with baselines.
4. Correct Minor Issues: Fix the incorrect reference in Footnote 2 on page 5, which mistakenly refers to the structural regularization term instead of the dynamical term.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does RDG compare to variational auto-encoders or deep Gaussian models in terms of both performance and conceptual differences?
2. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of RDG, particularly for large-scale datasets?
3. How sensitive is RDG to the quality of the predefined graph structure? Have you considered learning the graph structure as part of the model?
While the paper introduces an interesting approach to relational time series forecasting, addressing the above concerns is necessary to strengthen its contribution and ensure its impact on the field.
