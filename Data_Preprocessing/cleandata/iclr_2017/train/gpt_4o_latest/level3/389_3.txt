Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces SampleRNN, a novel RNN-based model for unconditional audio generation, which generates audio waveforms sample-by-sample. The authors propose a hierarchical structure where different modules operate at varying temporal resolutions, enabling the model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in audio. The paper claims significant improvements in sample quality over competing models, including WaveNet, as demonstrated through human evaluations and a novel likelihood-based quantitative measure. The authors also explore the impact of various architectural choices and provide empirical results on three datasets: Blizzard (speech), Onomatopoeia (human vocal sounds), and Music (Beethoven piano sonatas). The work is positioned as a step toward replacing handcrafted feature-based audio generation pipelines with end-to-end models.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting hierarchical RNN-based approach and demonstrates promising results, it has critical shortcomings in clarity, modeling choices, and evaluation rigor. These issues must be addressed before the work can be considered a strong contribution.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Clarity and Completeness of Model Description:  
   The paper lacks detailed equations and explanations for key components of the model. For instance, the rationale behind using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) at the sample-level module instead of another RNN is unclear. Similarly, the use of linear projections for up-sampling is not well-justified. These omissions make it difficult to fully understand and reproduce the proposed approach.
2. Questionable Comparisons with WaveNet:  
   The comparison with WaveNet is potentially flawed due to the authors' re-implementation, which may not match the original model's performance. The paper acknowledges differences in hyperparameters and architecture but does not provide sufficient justification for these choices or demonstrate that the comparison is fair.
3. Evaluation Methodology:  
   While human evaluations indicate a preference for SampleRNN, the paper does not provide sufficient details about the evaluation setup (e.g., number of participants, statistical significance of results). Additionally, the novel likelihood-based metric is not well-explained, making it hard to assess its validity.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Model Details:  
   Include detailed equations and explanations for all components of the model, particularly the MLP at the sample level and the linear projections for up-sampling. Clarify the design choices and their impact on performance.
2. Fair Comparisons:  
   Either use the original WaveNet implementation or provide a stronger justification for the re-implementation. Include ablation studies to isolate the impact of hierarchical RNNs versus other architectural differences.
3. Evaluation Rigor:  
   Provide more details about the human evaluation process, including participant demographics, statistical analysis, and confidence intervals. Clearly explain the novel likelihood-based metric and its relevance to audio quality.
4. Broader Context:  
   Situate the work more explicitly within the broader literature on audio generation. Discuss how SampleRNN compares to other recent models beyond WaveNet, such as GAN-based or diffusion-based approaches.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was an MLP used at the sample-level module instead of an RNN? How does this choice affect the model's ability to capture dependencies at the sample level?
2. Can you provide more details about the novel likelihood-based metric? How does it correlate with human perception of audio quality?
3. How do you ensure that the comparison with WaveNet is fair, given the differences in implementation and hyperparameters?
4. What is the rationale for using linear projections for up-sampling? Have you considered alternative up-sampling methods, such as transposed convolutions?
Conclusion
The paper presents an innovative approach to audio generation and demonstrates promising results. However, the lack of clarity in model description, questionable comparisons with WaveNet, and insufficient evaluation rigor significantly weaken the paper's contribution. Addressing these issues could make the work a valuable addition to the field.
