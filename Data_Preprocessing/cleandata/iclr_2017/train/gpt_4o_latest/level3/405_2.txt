Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents enhancements to environment simulators for agent-based systems, specifically focusing on long-term, temporally and spatially coherent predictions from high-dimensional pixel observations. The authors propose modifications to the LSTM architecture, making the hidden state directly dependent on previous actions, and explore alternative training schemes to improve prediction accuracy over long time horizons. Additionally, a novel prediction-independent simulator is introduced to address computational inefficiencies by skipping intermediate frame generation. The paper evaluates the models on diverse environments, including Atari games, a 3D car racing simulator, and 3D mazes, and demonstrates their utility for model-based exploration and live human interaction.
Decision: Reject
Key reasons for rejection:
1. Limited Technical Novelty: The architectural modification to make LSTM states action-dependent is incremental and lacks sufficient novelty compared to prior works. The training scheme variations, while interesting, are conceptually similar to existing approaches like schedule sampling.
2. Insufficient Empirical Justification: The performance improvements attributed to the proposed architectural changes are not well-isolated in the experiments, making it unclear whether the modifications are the primary contributors to the observed gains.
3. Clarity and Presentation Issues: The experimental setup is often unclear, and the reliance on external links for qualitative analysis disrupts the reading flow. Figures are difficult to interpret, further hindering comprehension.
Supporting Arguments
1. Modification to Model Architecture: While the motivation to make LSTM states action-dependent is reasonable, the novelty is marginal. Similar ideas have been explored in prior works, and the paper does not convincingly demonstrate why this approach is superior. The empirical results do not isolate the impact of this modification, making it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness independently of other factors.
   
2. Exploring Training Schemes: The analysis of training schemes is the most compelling aspect of the paper. However, the findings largely align with existing literature, such as the benefits of prediction-dependent transitions for long-term accuracy. The trade-offs between short-term and long-term accuracy are well-documented but do not significantly advance the state of the art.
3. Exploring Jumpy Predictions: The idea of skipping intermediate frames for computational efficiency is practical but not novel. The analysis across different games is insufficient to generalize the findings, and the performance trade-offs are not thoroughly explored.
4. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper suffers from presentation issues. The experimental setup is not described in sufficient detail, and the figures are challenging to interpret. Requiring readers to navigate external links for qualitative analysis disrupts the flow and accessibility of the paper.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Isolate Contributions: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the impact of architectural modifications and training schemes. This would provide stronger empirical evidence for the claims.
2. Broader Analysis: Provide a more comprehensive analysis of the jumpy prediction approach across a wider range of environments and tasks to better understand its generalizability.
3. Improve Presentation: Ensure that all experimental details are included in the paper, and improve the quality and interpretability of figures. Avoid relying on external links for qualitative results.
4. Theoretical Insights: Include a theoretical discussion or justification for the proposed architectural changes and training schemes to strengthen the paper's contributions.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed action-dependent LSTM compare to other state-of-the-art architectures in terms of computational complexity and scalability?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the architectural modifications and training schemes?
3. How robust are the proposed methods to environments with stochastic dynamics or noisy observations, which are common in real-world scenarios?
While the paper presents interesting experimental observations, the lack of strong technical novelty, insufficient empirical justification, and clarity issues make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. However, addressing the above concerns could significantly improve the paper's impact and contribution.
