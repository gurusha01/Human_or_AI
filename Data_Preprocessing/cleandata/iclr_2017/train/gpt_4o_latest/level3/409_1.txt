The paper introduces MusicNet, a well-curated, large-scale dataset for classical music with over 1 million temporal labels across 34 hours of recordings. The dataset is meticulously annotated and constrained to classical music, ensuring homogeneity and utility for the machine learning (ML) community. The authors address a critical gap in music informatics research, where the lack of large, labeled datasets has hindered progress in supervised learning and feature extraction. MusicNet provides a valuable resource for developing and benchmarking ML models for music analysis, particularly in note prediction tasks.
The dataset's construction and validation process is robust and scientifically rigorous. The authors employ dynamic time warping and careful alignment techniques to ensure high-quality annotations. Basic experiments using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and spectrogram-based models demonstrate that MusicNet is sufficiently large to learn meaningful low-level features in an end-to-end context. While the experiments are not groundbreaking, they validate the dataset's utility and show that learned features modestly outperform traditional spectrogram features.
Decision: Accept
The primary reason for acceptance is the significant contribution of MusicNet as a high-quality, publicly available dataset. Its potential to advance music informatics research and provide baseline references outweighs the lack of innovation in experimental techniques. The dataset likely ranks in the top 15% of contributions due to its rarity and value to the community.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Problem Relevance: The paper addresses a critical bottleneck in music informaticsâ€”scarcity of large, labeled datasets. MusicNet fills this gap effectively.
2. Scientific Rigor: The dataset's construction and validation are methodologically sound, ensuring reliability for future research.
3. Community Impact: MusicNet is poised to become a standard benchmark, akin to ImageNet in computer vision, fostering reproducibility and innovation in music-related ML tasks.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Expand Experimental Scope: While the experiments validate the dataset, they lack novelty. Incorporating more advanced or diverse ML techniques (e.g., transformers or self-supervised learning) could strengthen the paper's impact.
2. Dataset Diversity: The dataset is skewed towards Beethoven and solo piano compositions. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include underrepresented instruments and composers to enhance generalizability.
3. Error Analysis: The paper could provide a more detailed error analysis of the alignment process and its impact on downstream tasks.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the dataset handle variations in tempo and dynamics across different performances of the same piece? Are these variations explicitly annotated or accounted for?
2. Could you elaborate on the potential biases introduced by the dataset's genre and composer constraints? How might these affect the generalization of ML models trained on MusicNet?
3. Are there plans to extend MusicNet to include other genres or more diverse instrumentation in future iterations?
In summary, MusicNet is a valuable contribution to the ML and music research communities. While the experimental work is secondary, the dataset itself is a significant step forward, warranting acceptance.
