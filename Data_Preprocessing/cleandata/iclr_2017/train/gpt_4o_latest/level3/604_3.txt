Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel approach to argumentation mining by leveraging a modified Pointer Network (PN) to extract links between argument components (ACs) and classify their roles (e.g., claim, premise). The authors argue that the PN architecture is well-suited for this task due to its ability to model sequential data, enforce tree-like structures, and jointly optimize for multiple subtasks. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets: the Persuasive Essay corpus and the Microtext corpus. Notably, the model performs well even with limited training data, demonstrating its robustness. The joint modeling of link prediction and AC classification, as well as the inclusion of a fully connected layer before the LSTM input, are highlighted as key factors contributing to the model's success.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted for the following reasons:
1. Novelty and Practical Impact: The adaptation of Pointer Networks to argumentation mining is novel and addresses a relevant NLP problem. The model's ability to perform well with minimal data is particularly impactful for resource-constrained domains.
2. Empirical Strength: The model outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods on multiple metrics across two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The use of Pointer Networks is justified by their ability to handle sequential data and enforce tree-like constraints, which align with the hierarchical nature of argument structures. The joint modeling of subtasks is also well-motivated and empirically validated.
2. Solid Quantitative Results: The model achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics, including link prediction and AC classification. Its performance on the Microtext corpus, despite limited training data, is particularly impressive.
3. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient detail about the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics, making the work reproducible.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong overall, the following areas could be improved:
1. Qualitative Analysis: The paper lacks examples of model outputs and qualitative error analysis. Including these would provide deeper insights into the model's strengths and limitations.
2. Comparative Baselines: While the choice of a Pointer Network is reasonable, the paper does not compare its performance against other tree-producing methods. This would strengthen the claim that PNs are particularly well-suited for this task.
3. Figure 2 Error: The error in Figure 2, where the decoder points to an output index instead of an input index, should be corrected for clarity.
4. Formatting Issues: The name "Wei12" appears to be incorrectly formatted. Ensuring proper citation formatting is essential for professionalism.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide examples of the model's predictions, particularly for cases where it succeeds or fails? This would help clarify how the model handles challenging cases.
2. How does the model handle longer sequences of ACs, where the number of potential links increases? Does performance degrade significantly in such cases?
3. Have you considered integrating subtasks 1 (AC identification) and 4 (link type classification) into the model? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?
In summary, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of argumentation mining by adapting Pointer Networks to a novel NLP problem. While there are areas for improvement, the paper's strengths in novelty, empirical results, and clarity justify its acceptance.
