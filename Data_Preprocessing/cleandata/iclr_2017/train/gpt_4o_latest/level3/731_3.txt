The paper presents a novel approach to learning short binary codes for document retrieval by extending Paragraph Vector models with a sigmoid nonlinearity, termed Binary Paragraph Vector models. The authors demonstrate that these binary codes outperform semantic hashing and other baselines in terms of retrieval precision, even when trained on unrelated corpora. They also introduce a Real-Binary PV-DBOW model that simultaneously learns both binary and real-valued representations, enabling efficient initial filtering and high-quality ranking. The work is evaluated on 20 Newsgroups and RCV1 datasets, showing competitive results.
Decision: Reject
While the paper offers a practical and straightforward method for learning binary codes, it lacks significant technical novelty. The proposed approach is primarily an adaptation of existing methods (e.g., PV-DBOW and sigmoid binarization) rather than a fundamentally new contribution. Additionally, critical issues in the experimental setup and presentation of results diminish the paper's overall impact.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Lack of Technical Novelty: The method builds on established techniques (e.g., sigmoid binarization and PV-DBOW) without introducing substantial theoretical or algorithmic innovations. While the results are promising, the simplicity of the approach does not justify acceptance in a competitive venue.
2. Experimental Gaps: The paper does not include baseline numbers from Salakhutdinov and Hinton's semantic hashing work, making direct comparisons difficult. Additionally, results for RCV1 and RCV2 are not directly comparable due to dataset differences, which are not adequately addressed.
3. Incomplete Evaluation: Precision at specific recall levels (e.g., 12.5%, 25%, 50%) is not explicitly reported, limiting the clarity of the results. Furthermore, the paper does not analyze how many binary bits are needed to match continuous representations, which is a critical question for practical applications.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Baseline Comparisons: Include explicit comparisons with semantic hashing baselines from Salakhutdinov and Hinton's work, as well as continuous PV-DBOW representations trained with bigrams, to provide a fairer evaluation.
2. Precision-Recall Analysis: Report precision at 12.5%, 25%, and 50% recall for both the proposed model and semantic hashing to improve result clarity.
3. Dataset Comparability: Address the differences between RCV1 and RCV2 datasets or restrict experiments to a single dataset for consistency.
4. Bit-Length Analysis: Analyze how the performance of binary codes varies with code length, providing insights into the trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency.
5. Grammatical and Terminological Clarity: Fix minor grammatical errors and clarify terms like "code size" in Table 1 to enhance readability.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the performance of Binary PV-DBOW compare to continuous PV-DBOW trained with bigrams? Could this comparison be included for completeness?
2. Can you provide baseline numbers from Salakhutdinov and Hinton's semantic hashing work for direct comparison?
3. What is the impact of varying the number of binary bits on retrieval performance? Could this analysis be added to the paper?
In summary, while the paper presents a practical and efficient method for document retrieval, its lack of novelty and incomplete evaluation prevent it from meeting the standards of this conference. Addressing the above concerns could significantly strengthen the work.
