The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for segmenting bioacoustic data using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). It aims to address the challenge of automatically identifying song units in bioacoustic recordings without prior knowledge of the number of hidden states. The authors apply this Bayesian non-parametric model to two real-world datasets: humpback whale songs and multi-species bird vocalizations. They argue that this approach is particularly suited for bioacoustic data, where manual segmentation is infeasible and expert consensus is often lacking. The paper highlights the potential of HDP-HMM for structuring bioacoustic signals and contributing to ecological and behavioral studies.
Decision: Reject. The primary reasons for this decision are the lack of convincing results and the poor clarity of the paper. While the problem is relevant and the approach is theoretically sound, the experimental outcomes fail to align closely with expert segmentations, and the writing quality significantly hampers comprehension.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Relevance and Motivation: The paper addresses an important problem in bioacoustics and provides a well-motivated application of HDP-HMM to a challenging domain. The use of Bayesian non-parametric methods to infer the number of song units is a meaningful contribution to the field.
2. Results and Rigor: The results, particularly for bird vocalizations, show limited alignment with expert segmentations (mean NMI score of 0.367). This raises concerns about the practical utility of the proposed method. The authors acknowledge several limitations, such as sensitivity to noise and insufficient Gibbs sampling iterations, but these issues undermine the claims of the paper.
3. Clarity and Presentation: The paper suffers from poor writing, with numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. This makes it difficult to follow the methodology and interpret the results. Key details, such as the rationale for parameter choices and the implications of the segmentation results, are not adequately explained.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Improve Writing Quality: The paper needs substantial editing for grammar, clarity, and organization. Clearer explanations of the methodology, results, and their implications are essential.
2. Enhance Experimental Validation: The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with expert segmentations and explore alternative evaluation metrics. Addressing the discrepancies in segmentation results (e.g., over-segmentation or under-segmentation) is critical.
3. Investigate Feature Representations: The use of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) may not fully capture the complexity of bioacoustic signals. Exploring alternative or complementary features could improve performance.
4. Address Computational Limitations: The authors acknowledge the computational expense of their approach. Future work should explore more efficient inference methods, such as variational inference, to scale the model to larger datasets.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How do the authors plan to address the discrepancies between model segmentations and expert annotations in future work?
2. Could the authors provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., truncation levels, Gibbs iterations) and their impact on the results?
3. Have the authors considered incorporating domain-specific knowledge or constraints to guide the segmentation process?
In summary, while the paper tackles an important problem and applies a sophisticated model, the lack of convincing results and poor presentation make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form.
