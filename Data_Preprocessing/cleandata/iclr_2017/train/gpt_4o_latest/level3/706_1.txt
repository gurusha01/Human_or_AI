Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces new prior and approximate posterior families for variational autoencoders (VAEs) that support the reparameterization trick while enabling the modeling of multiple modes in latent variable distributions. The authors propose a piecewise constant prior and posterior, which aim to overcome the limitations of unimodal Gaussian priors in capturing the complex, multimodal nature of real-world data. A gating mechanism between the prior and posterior is also introduced, which improves performance on document modeling tasks. The proposed framework is evaluated on document modeling and dialogue response generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several document modeling benchmarks. The paper also provides an analysis of the learned latent variables, highlighting the ability of piecewise variables to capture specific aspects of the data, such as time-related words and events in dialogue modeling.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces a promising idea with the piecewise constant variational family and demonstrates strong empirical results for document modeling, it falls short in several critical areas. The lack of clarity in the theoretical justification, insufficient ablation studies, and weak experimental results on dialogue modeling make it difficult to fully assess the contributions and generalizability of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Theoretical Issues: The claim that a unimodal latent prior cannot model multimodal observations is incorrect. While the proposed piecewise constant prior has sensible motivations, the paper does not adequately justify why it is superior to existing methods, such as normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians, which also address multimodality.
2. Experimental Weaknesses: 
   - The dialogue modeling results are mostly negative, with no significant improvements over baselines. Although the encoding of time-related words and sentiment in different variables is intriguing, the lack of quantitative gains undermines the contribution in this domain.
   - The document modeling results, while strong, lack ablation studies to disentangle the contributions of the piecewise prior, gating mechanism, and other architectural choices. This makes it unclear which components drive the improvements.
3. Conceptual Ambiguity: The paper's treatment of "multi-modality" is inconsistent. It discusses multimodality in observed data, prior, and posterior, but fails to clearly demonstrate which type is being modeled or how the proposed method addresses each.
4. Interpretability and Analysis: The qualitative analysis of the learned prior modes is insufficient. While adding more constant components improves performance, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of what these modes represent or how they align with the data's structure.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Theoretical Claims: Address the incorrect claim about unimodal priors and provide a more rigorous comparison with alternative approaches for modeling multimodality, such as normalizing flows or discrete latent variables.
2. Ablation Studies: Conduct thorough ablation experiments to isolate the effects of the piecewise prior, gating mechanism, and other components. This would help clarify the source of improvements in document modeling.
3. Improved Dialogue Modeling: Investigate why the proposed method underperforms on dialogue modeling tasks. Consider additional experiments on standard datasets like MNIST to demonstrate the general applicability of the approach.
4. Qualitative Analysis: Provide a more detailed qualitative analysis of the learned prior modes, including their interpretability and alignment with distinct data patterns.
5. Dataset Diversity: Testing on a broader range of datasets, including standard benchmarks like MNIST, could strengthen the paper's contributions and demonstrate the generality of the proposed method.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a more detailed explanation of why the piecewise constant prior improves performance over other multimodal priors, such as mixtures of Gaussians or normalizing flows?
2. Why were ablation studies not conducted to isolate the contributions of different components of the proposed framework?
3. How do you explain the negative results on dialogue modeling, and what steps could be taken to improve performance in this domain?
4. Could you clarify how the proposed method handles the three types of multimodality (observed data, prior, posterior) and provide evidence for each?
In conclusion, while the paper introduces an interesting idea with the piecewise constant prior, it requires stronger theoretical justification, more comprehensive experiments, and clearer analysis to make a compelling case for acceptance.
