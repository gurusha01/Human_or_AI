Review of the Paper: Variational Walkback for Generative Modeling
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel generative modeling approach, Variational Walkback, which employs an annealing-based transition operator to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. The method builds upon prior work such as RAISE and AIS but innovates by learning transition probabilities rather than fixing them, as in RAISE. This eliminates the need for symmetric weights, enhancing biological plausibility. The authors propose a framework that locally "carves" the energy function, avoiding the need for expensive MCMC sampling in the inner loop. The paper also introduces a temperature annealing schedule to efficiently eliminate spurious modes and improve training convergence. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate the approach's potential, with competitive results in inpainting tasks and generative modeling.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a promising idea, several critical issues undermine its scientific rigor and clarity. These include insufficient quantitative validation, errors in theoretical analysis, and inadequate discussion of related work. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the paper.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Theoretical and Empirical Validation: 
   - The analysis in Appendix D appears flawed, as it assumes constant temperature, conflicting with Neal (2001). This undermines the theoretical justification for the variational bound's tightness.
   - The paper does not report log-likelihood estimates, which are standard for evaluating generative models and would allow direct comparison with prior work like RAISE on datasets such as MNIST.
   - Quantitative results are limited, and the claims about the method's superiority are not convincingly supported by empirical evidence.
2. Relationship to Prior Work: 
   - The connection to AIS and RAISE is only briefly mentioned. A detailed comparison, particularly regarding the advantages of learning transition probabilities, is necessary to contextualize the contribution.
   - Missing citations for related methods in the literature weaken the paper's placement within the broader research landscape.
3. Clarity and Justification:
   - The justification for "carving the energy function" is vague and detracts from the focus on optimizing the variational lower bound. This needs clearer exposition.
   - The characterization of ML training for undirected graphical models as requiring MCMC sampling is misleading, as methods like Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) often use single-step updates.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Theoretical Corrections: Address the inconsistency in Appendix D regarding temperature variation and provide a rigorous analysis of the variational bound's tightness.
2. Quantitative Validation: Report log-likelihood estimates and compare them with state-of-the-art methods like RAISE and AIS on standard benchmarks. Include additional experiments to substantiate claims about spurious mode elimination and training efficiency.
3. Discussion of Related Work: Expand the discussion of AIS, RAISE, and other related methods. Highlight the specific advantages of the proposed approach in detail, including its implications for biological plausibility and computational efficiency.
4. Clarity in Presentation: Reframe the "carving the energy function" intuition to align with the mathematical framework. Provide clearer explanations of the annealing schedule and its role in training.
5. Minor Revisions: Correct the characterization of PCD and ensure all methods in the related work section are properly cited.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare quantitatively to RAISE and AIS in terms of log-likelihood estimates and sample quality?
2. Can you clarify the role of temperature annealing in the variational bound's tightness and address the inconsistency in Appendix D?
3. How does the method perform on more challenging datasets or tasks beyond MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA?
In conclusion, the paper introduces an interesting idea with potential, but the current submission lacks the rigor and validation necessary for acceptance. Addressing the highlighted issues could make this work a strong contribution to the field.
