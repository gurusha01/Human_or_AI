Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions  
The paper investigates the problem of network morphism at a higher level, proposing a novel approach to morph convolutional layers into arbitrary modules while preserving network functionality. The authors introduce a graph-based abstraction for modular network morphism, define simple and complex morphable modules, and propose algorithms for morphing these modules. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline ResNet models with minimal additional computational cost. The paper claims that the proposed morphing approach achieves up to 25% relative error reduction and provides a systematic framework for exploring new architectures with reduced computational and human effort.
Decision: Reject  
While the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to network morphism, the lack of rigorous experimental evidence and weaker baseline comparisons undermine the validity of its claims. The following key reasons contribute to this decision:  
1. The baseline ResNet models used in the experiments underperform compared to standard implementations in the literature and publicly available GitHub repositories, raising concerns about the reliability of the reported improvements.  
2. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed morphing approach outperforms training from scratch for the same architectures. This is a critical gap, as the claimed benefits of network morphism hinge on its efficiency and effectiveness compared to conventional training.  
Supporting Arguments  
1. Weaker Baselines: The performance of the baseline ResNet models used in the experiments is significantly lower than reported state-of-the-art results. For example, the CIFAR-10 results for ResNet-20 and ResNet-56 are suboptimal compared to standard benchmarks. This makes the reported improvements less convincing, as they may be attributed to subpar baselines rather than the effectiveness of the morphing approach.  
2. Lack of Comparative Evidence: The paper does not systematically compare the proposed morphing approach to training the same architectures from scratch. While some results suggest that morphing achieves better performance, the evidence is anecdotal and lacks statistical rigor. A direct comparison with training from scratch is necessary to validate the claimed advantages of network morphism.  
3. Incremental Costs: The paper does not adequately address the computational and training time overhead introduced by the morphing process. While the approach claims to be efficient, the lack of detailed analysis on these aspects leaves the reader uncertain about its practicality.  
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Stronger Baselines: Use standard ResNet implementations from the literature or publicly available repositories to ensure fair and credible comparisons.  
2. Comparative Experiments: Provide a thorough comparison of the proposed morphing approach with training from scratch for the same architectures. Include statistical significance tests to strengthen the claims.  
3. Detailed Cost Analysis: Include a detailed analysis of the computational and training time costs introduced by the morphing process. This will help assess the trade-offs between performance improvements and resource requirements.  
4. Broader Evaluation: Evaluate the proposed approach on additional datasets and architectures to demonstrate its generalizability and robustness.  
Questions for the Authors  
1. How do the baseline ResNet models used in the experiments compare to standard implementations in terms of performance and architecture?  
2. Can you provide detailed results comparing the proposed morphing approach to training from scratch for the same architectures?  
3. What is the incremental training time and computational cost introduced by the morphing process? How does this compare to training from scratch?  
4. Have you explored the applicability of the proposed approach to other network architectures beyond ResNet?  
In conclusion, while the paper introduces a novel and potentially impactful approach to network morphism, the lack of rigorous experimental validation and weaker baselines significantly weaken its contributions. Addressing the outlined concerns and providing additional evidence could make this work more compelling for acceptance in the future.
