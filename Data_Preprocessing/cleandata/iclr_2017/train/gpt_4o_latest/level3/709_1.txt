Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel method for unsupervised pretraining of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models by initializing both the encoder and decoder with pretrained language models (LMs). The approach is simple yet effective, leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data to improve generalization and optimization in downstream tasks. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements in machine translation (Englishâ†’German) and abstractive summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks (+1.3 BLEU over prior best models) and competitive results on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization dataset. Extensive ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of various components, such as pretraining the encoder versus decoder, the importance of the LM objective, and the benefits of pretraining on large monolingual corpora. The paper is well-written, experimentally rigorous, and provides a strong empirical foundation for its claims.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of seq2seq learning by introducing a novel pretraining strategy that is both simple and generalizable across tasks. The strong empirical results, coupled with thorough ablation studies, justify acceptance. The method's flexibility and potential applicability to other tasks further enhance its impact.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Simplicity: Unlike prior work, which often focuses on pretraining either the encoder or decoder, this paper pretrains both components using LMs. This dual pretraining approach is novel and demonstrates substantial performance gains, particularly in low-resource settings.
2. Strong Empirical Results: The method achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation and competitive results in abstractive summarization. The +2.7 BLEU improvement in machine translation over baseline models is particularly noteworthy.
3. Thorough Analysis: The ablation studies are comprehensive, providing insights into the sources of performance improvements. For example, the study highlights the critical role of pretraining the decoder and the LM objective as a regularizer.
4. Broader Applicability: The technique is task-agnostic and can be applied to a variety of seq2seq problems, making it a valuable contribution to the broader NLP community.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Comparison with Related Work: While the paper discusses related work, a more detailed comparison with other semi-supervised or unsupervised methods, such as backtranslation or autoencoders, would strengthen the positioning of the proposed approach.
2. Summarization Results: The results on abstractive summarization are less impressive compared to machine translation. The authors could explore additional techniques, such as using bidirectional LSTMs or pretrained embeddings, to further improve summarization performance.
3. Scalability and Resource Requirements: The method relies on training large LMs on extensive monolingual corpora, which may not be feasible for all researchers. A discussion on computational efficiency or potential trade-offs would be helpful.
4. Human Evaluation: While the paper includes a small-scale human evaluation for summarization, a larger and more detailed study would provide stronger evidence of the method's effectiveness in generating high-quality summaries.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method perform on other language pairs or tasks beyond machine translation and summarization? Have you considered testing on low-resource languages or domains?
2. Could the proposed pretraining strategy be adapted for transformer-based architectures, such as BERT or GPT, which are increasingly popular in seq2seq tasks?
3. How sensitive is the method to the size and quality of the monolingual corpora used for LM pretraining? Would smaller or noisier datasets significantly degrade performance?
In conclusion, this paper presents a simple yet impactful method for improving seq2seq models through unsupervised pretraining. Its strong empirical results, coupled with thorough analysis, make it a valuable contribution to the field. With minor improvements and clarifications, it has the potential to inspire further research in this area.
