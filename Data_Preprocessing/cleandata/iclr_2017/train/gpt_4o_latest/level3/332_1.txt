Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces Object Persistence Net (OPnet), a model designed to improve perceptual similarity judgments by fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (AlexNet) using a triplet loss function. The key innovation lies in incorporating object persistence constraints, which bring different views of the same object closer in the feature space while separating views of different objects. The model is evaluated on object instance and category retrieval tasks using datasets of novel objects, including synthetic datasets and the Tenenbaum objects, and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline CNNs and existing methods. Notably, OPnet achieves a higher correlation with human perceptual similarity judgments compared to AlexNet, supporting the hypothesis that object persistence plays a role in shaping human similarity perception.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting and somewhat novel use of triplet loss for cross-view learning, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons:
1. Insufficient Placement in the Literature: The paper lacks adequate references to related work and does not compare its approach against several existing state-of-the-art methods. For instance, the omission of a comparison with the "image purification" paper (Su et al., SIGGRAPH Asia 2015) is a significant oversight, as it is directly relevant to cross-view retrieval.
2. Limited Scientific Rigor in Evaluation: Although the results are promising, the evaluation is incomplete. The paper primarily focuses on comparisons with AlexNet and a single prior method (Li et al., 2015), but does not benchmark against other relevant approaches in distance metric learning or multi-view object retrieval, which undermines the generalizability of its claims.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Novelty and Technical Contribution: The use of triplet loss for cross-view learning is a positive contribution, and the paper demonstrates that OPnet achieves better instance- and category-level retrieval performance than AlexNet. The transferability of the learned representations to novel objects and categories is particularly noteworthy. However, the novelty is incremental rather than groundbreaking, as triplet loss and Siamese architectures are well-established in the literature.
   
2. Evaluation and Comparisons: While the paper shows improvements over AlexNet and AlexNetFT, it does not compare OPnet to a broader range of relevant methods, such as other distance metric learning approaches or 3D shape retrieval models. The lack of a comparison with Su et al. (2015) is a glaring omission, as their work on cross-view retrieval is highly relevant. Additionally, the evaluation on real-world datasets is limited, and the authors acknowledge that OPnet's performance gains diminish in such settings.
3. Human Perception Correlation: The higher correlation of OPnet with human perceptual similarity judgments is an interesting result. However, the testing on human perception data (Tenenbaum objects) is limited in scope and does not provide sufficient evidence to fully support the hypothesis that object persistence constraints align with human similarity judgments.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Related Work: The paper should include a more comprehensive review of related work, particularly in the areas of cross-view retrieval, distance metric learning, and 3D shape representation. The authors should explicitly compare OPnet against Su et al. (2015) and other relevant methods.
   
2. Broaden Evaluation: The evaluation should include additional state-of-the-art methods and datasets, particularly real-world datasets with more complex variations (e.g., lighting, scale, and occlusion). This would strengthen the claims of generalizability and transferability.
3. Clarify Novelty: The authors should better articulate the novelty of their approach compared to existing methods. For example, how does OPnet differ fundamentally from other triplet-based or Siamese architectures?
4. Address Overfitting: The paper acknowledges that OPnet overfits to the ShapeNet dataset, which limits its applicability to real-world scenarios. Future work should explore methods to mitigate this overfitting, such as incorporating additional nuisance variables or more diverse training datasets.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does OPnet compare to other state-of-the-art methods in cross-view retrieval, such as Su et al. (2015) or other recent approaches in distance metric learning?
2. Can the authors provide more details on the limitations of OPnet in real-world datasets? What steps could be taken to improve its performance in such settings?
3. How does the choice of margin parameter \(M\) in the triplet loss affect the results? Were other values tested, and if so, how did they impact performance?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach, it falls short in terms of situating its contributions within the broader literature and providing a comprehensive evaluation. Addressing these issues would significantly strengthen the paper.
