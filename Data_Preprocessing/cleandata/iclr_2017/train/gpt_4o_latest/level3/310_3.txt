Summary of Contributions  
This paper introduces a novel framework for language learning through multi-agent communication, specifically focusing on referential games. The authors demonstrate that two neural network agents can develop meaningful symbolic communication by playing these games, using pretrained image representations and reinforcement learning (REINFORCE). The emergent communication encodes high-level semantic concepts, as evidenced by experiments with different game setups and image classes. A multi-game setup combining referential games with supervised image classification is proposed, which grounds the learned communication in human language and enhances interpretability. This approach offers an alternative to sequence-to-sequence models by emphasizing the functional aspects of language. The paper provides a strong foundation for future research in multi-agent communication, with promising implications for building conversational AI.
Decision: Accept  
The paper is well-motivated, addresses an important problem in AI, and presents a novel and scientifically rigorous approach. The key reasons for acceptance are:  
1. The innovative combination of referential games and supervised learning to ground communication in human language, which is a significant step toward interpretable and human-compatible AI.  
2. Strong empirical results that support the claims, including the emergence of meaningful symbolic communication and improved interpretability in the multi-game setup.  
Supporting Arguments  
1. Problem and Motivation: The paper tackles the critical problem of developing interactive AI systems capable of meaningful communication. It is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in multi-agent systems, linguistics, and reinforcement learning, while addressing the limitations of passive supervised learning approaches.  
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, demonstrating that agents can successfully coordinate and develop interpretable communication. The use of purity metrics, t-SNE visualizations, and human evaluations strengthens the validity of the results. The multi-game setup is particularly compelling, as it bridges the gap between emergent communication and human language.  
3. Novelty: The focus on functional aspects of language and the integration of supervised learning for grounding are innovative contributions that distinguish this work from prior studies.  
Suggestions for Improvement  
1. Clarifications: The paper should provide more details on how the target variable \( t \) is incorporated into the sender network. This is critical for understanding the sender's decision-making process.  
2. Formatting and Errors: Address inconsistencies in percentage formatting in Tables 1 and 2, and verify the accuracy of Table 1 values. Fix minor typos such as "assest" → "assess" and "usufal" → "usual."  
3. Analysis Depth: While the purity metric is informative, additional analysis of the semantic properties of emergent communication (e.g., using clustering or similarity metrics) could provide deeper insights.  
4. Human Evaluation: The human evaluation results are promising but could benefit from a larger sample size and more detailed analysis of failure cases to identify areas for improvement.  
Questions for the Authors  
1. How does the sender network explicitly encode the target variable \( t \), and how does this influence the emergent communication?  
2. Did you explore the impact of varying the vocabulary size or embedding dimensionality on the semantic quality of communication?  
3. Could the framework be extended to multi-step communication or back-and-forth interaction between agents? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?  
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of multi-agent communication and interactive AI. While there are minor areas for improvement, the novelty, rigor, and potential impact of the work strongly justify acceptance.
