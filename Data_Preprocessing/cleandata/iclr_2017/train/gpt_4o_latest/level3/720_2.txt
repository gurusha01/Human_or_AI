Review of the Paper: "Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations for Multi-Field Categorical Data"
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces Cat2Vec, a method for learning distributed representations for multi-field categorical data. The approach embeds categories into a low-dimensional space, explicitly models pairwise interactions using neural gates, and applies K-max pooling to select the most informative interactions. By iterating this process, the model captures higher-order interactions for downstream tasks such as classification or regression. The authors claim that Cat2Vec improves over state-of-the-art models in tasks like click-through rate (CTR) prediction, demonstrating its ability to capture significant patterns in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The paper also draws an analogy between its iterative interaction modeling and the Apriori algorithm in association rule mining.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons:
1. Lack of Novelty: While the explicit modeling of pairwise interactions is an interesting addition, the core ideas—embedding categorical data and using deep networks for feature extraction—are well-established in the literature. The contribution is incremental and does not provide sufficient innovation to warrant acceptance.
2. Weak Experimental Validation: The evaluation is limited to one real-world dataset (iPinYou) and synthetic data, with comparisons made against weak baselines. The omission of stronger baselines, such as wsabie or other advanced deep learning models, undermines the claims of superiority.
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper builds on existing techniques like embeddings (Word2Vec-inspired) and neural network-based feature extraction. While the use of K-max pooling and neural gates for pairwise interactions is novel in this specific context, these components are not fundamentally new. Furthermore, the claim that higher-order interactions are captured iteratively could likely be achieved by existing deep convolutional networks without explicit pairwise modeling.
   
2. Experimental Weakness: The experimental results are not comprehensive. The use of only one real-world dataset (iPinYou) is insufficient to generalize the findings. Additionally, comparisons are made against simple baselines (e.g., DNN Concat, DNN Sum) rather than stronger models like wsabie, CCPM, or other advanced architectures. This raises concerns about the robustness of the proposed method.
3. Missed Opportunities: The paper does not explore alternatives such as using a deep convolutional network with margin loss, which could potentially outperform the proposed method. This lack of exploration limits the scope of the contribution.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Validation: Evaluate the method on multiple real-world datasets across different domains to demonstrate generalizability. Include comparisons with stronger baselines, such as wsabie, DeepFM, or Wide & Deep Learning models.
   
2. Clarify Novelty: Clearly articulate how Cat2Vec differs from existing methods and why explicit pairwise modeling is necessary. Provide theoretical or empirical evidence that these interactions cannot be learned implicitly by existing deep models.
3. Explore Alternatives: Investigate whether a deep convolutional network or other architectures can achieve similar or better results. This would help justify the need for the proposed iterative interaction modeling.
4. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of individual components, such as neural gates, K-max pooling, and the iterative process. This would clarify their specific impact on performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were stronger baselines, such as wsabie or DeepFM, not included in the comparisons? How would Cat2Vec perform against these models?
2. How does the model handle scalability issues with large categorical fields, especially when the number of categories is in the millions?
3. Could the authors provide more insights into why explicit pairwise modeling is necessary, as opposed to relying on implicit feature extraction by deep networks?
4. How does the choice of K in K-max pooling affect performance? Is there a systematic way to tune this parameter?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to modeling multi-field categorical data, the lack of novelty and insufficient experimental validation prevent it from making a strong case for acceptance. Addressing the above concerns could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
