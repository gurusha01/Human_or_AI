Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel multiagent system framework as a generalization of neural networks, aiming to eliminate the restrictive layer-based architecture and matrix-vector computation scheme. The authors argue that this system is more biologically plausible, scalable, and memory-efficient. They demonstrate the equivalence of their multiagent system to Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE) both theoretically and empirically. Additionally, they introduce a variant called Sparse Connect SDAE (SCSDAE), which reduces computational cost by truncating edges in the network. Experiments on the MNIST dataset and a toy XOR dataset validate the equivalence of the multiagent and standard SDAE implementations and highlight the computational efficiency of SCSDAE.
Decision: Reject
The key reasons for rejection are:  
1. The proposed multiagent system does not present a fundamentally novel departure from existing neural network architectures. It can be reframed as a neural network with more complex connectivity structures, which undermines the claim of generalization.  
2. The computational efficiency claims are only benchmarked against sparsely connected autoencoders, not fully-connected neural networks, which limits the scope of the results.  
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of Fundamental Novelty: While the paper argues that the multiagent system is free from the constraints of layer-based architectures, this claim is misleading. Neural networks are not inherently limited to matrix-matrix multiplication or layer-based structures, as demonstrated by existing works on graph neural networks and other non-layered architectures. The multiagent system can be reframed as a neural network with more complex connectivity, making it an incremental rather than transformative contribution.  
2. Limited Empirical Comparisons: The computational efficiency of the Sparse Connect SDAE is only compared to sparsely connected autoencoders. A more rigorous evaluation would benchmark against fully-connected networks and other state-of-the-art sparse neural network techniques. Without such comparisons, the claimed advantages remain unconvincing.  
3. Biological Plausibility: While the authors emphasize biological plausibility as a motivation, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence or discussion to substantiate this claim beyond a superficial analogy to local interactions in the brain.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Benchmarking: Include comparisons of computational efficiency and performance against fully-connected neural networks and other sparse network techniques. This would strengthen the claims of efficiency and scalability.  
2. Clarify Novelty: Clearly articulate how the proposed multiagent system differs fundamentally from existing neural network frameworks, such as graph neural networks or other non-layered architectures.  
3. Biological Plausibility: Provide more rigorous evidence or analysis to support the claim of biological plausibility. For example, compare the system's behavior to known properties of biological neural networks.  
4. Theoretical Insights: Beyond empirical equivalence, provide theoretical insights into why the multiagent system might offer advantages over standard neural networks in terms of representation power or optimization.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed multiagent system compare in computational efficiency and performance to fully-connected neural networks?  
2. Can you provide more concrete evidence or metrics to support the claim of biological plausibility?  
3. How does the multiagent system handle scalability in larger and more complex datasets beyond MNIST?  
4. Could the proposed framework be extended to other neural network paradigms, such as convolutional or recurrent networks?  
While the paper introduces an interesting perspective, it falls short in demonstrating significant novelty or providing sufficient empirical evidence to justify its claims. Addressing the above concerns could strengthen the contribution and make the work more impactful.
