Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel convolutional framework for graph-structured data, extending the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) beyond grid-based inputs. The method leverages random walks to define ordered neighbors, transforming graphs into feature matrices suitable for matrix multiplication. The authors claim that their approach is parameter-efficient, computationally feasible, and applicable to both regression and classification tasks. They validate their method on the Merck Molecular Activity dataset and MNIST, demonstrating its potential for supervised learning on graph-structured data. The paper also highlights the computational efficiency of the proposed convolution, which requires only a one-time preprocessing step to compute the graph structure.
Decision: Reject
The paper is not ready for publication in its current form. The primary reasons for this decision are:
1. Unconvincing Empirical Evaluation: The choice of MNIST as a benchmark is problematic, as it removes the spatial structure of the data and artificially increases task difficulty. The results on MNIST are underwhelming compared to regular CNNs, which undermines the claimed generalization capability of the proposed method.
2. Flawed Comparisons: The comparison with standard CNNs is not rigorous. The proposed method performs poorly on MNIST, failing to achieve competitive accuracy. This raises questions about its practical utility.
3. Insufficient Incorporation of Graph Structure: The method does not fully leverage the graph structure in datasets where node relations are not adequately captured by a similarity matrix. This limits its applicability to real-world graph data.
Supporting Arguments
1. The empirical results on MNIST are suboptimal. The proposed method achieves worse performance than regular CNNs, even when the graph structure is artificially imposed. This suggests that the method does not effectively exploit the graph representation.
2. The use of MNIST as a benchmark is inappropriate for evaluating graph-based methods. By removing the spatial structure, the task becomes unnecessarily complicated and does not reflect the strengths of the proposed approach.
3. The paper lacks a robust comparison with state-of-the-art graph-based methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). This omission makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Dataset Selection: The authors should evaluate their method on datasets with inherent graph structures (e.g., citation networks, social networks, or molecular graphs) to better demonstrate its utility.
2. Incorporate Graph Structure: The method should be extended to account for additional graph-specific features, such as relative node positions or edge weights, to improve its performance on datasets where the similarity matrix is insufficient.
3. Comparison with Baselines: The paper should include comparisons with established graph-based methods, such as GCNs or spectral approaches, to provide a clearer context for its contributions.
4. Pooling Mechanisms: The authors mention the potential for developing efficient pooling methods for graphs. Including such mechanisms in the current work could strengthen the method's applicability and performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to existing graph-based methods like GCNs or spectral CNNs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
2. Why was MNIST chosen as a benchmark, given its lack of inherent graph structure? Could you provide results on datasets with natural graph representations?
3. How does the method handle datasets with sparse or noisy graph structures? Have you evaluated its robustness in such scenarios?
In summary, while the paper presents an interesting idea for generalizing CNNs to graph-structured data, it falls short in empirical validation and methodological rigor. Addressing the concerns outlined above could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
