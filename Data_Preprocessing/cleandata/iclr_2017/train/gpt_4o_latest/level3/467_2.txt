Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs), a novel framework for unsupervised feature learning that extends the standard GAN architecture by incorporating an encoder to learn the inverse mapping from data to latent space. The authors argue that this bidirectional mapping enables the learned latent representations to serve as useful features for downstream supervised tasks. The paper provides theoretical guarantees that the encoder and generator learn to invert each other at the global optimum and demonstrates the utility of BiGANs for feature learning on both simple (MNIST) and complex (ImageNet) datasets. Empirical results show that BiGANs are competitive with contemporary self-supervised and weakly supervised methods for feature learning, particularly in the visual domain.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting extension to GANs and demonstrates promising results, the work falls short in several critical areas. The theoretical contributions are sound, but the empirical evaluation lacks sufficient rigor and comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address the significant performance gap between BiGANs and supervised convolutional networks for feature learning, which undermines its practical applicability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Placement in Literature:  
   The paper is well-motivated, addressing the limitation of standard GANs in lacking an inverse mapping from data to latent space. The proposed BiGAN framework is positioned appropriately within the literature, with clear connections to related work on GANs, autoencoders, and self-supervised learning. However, the paper does not sufficiently explore how BiGANs compare to other bidirectional GAN variants, such as ALI (Adversarially Learned Inference), which was developed concurrently.
2. Empirical Evaluation:  
   While the results on MNIST and ImageNet demonstrate that BiGANs can learn meaningful features, the evaluation is limited in scope. The reported performance on ImageNet transfer tasks is competitive with some unsupervised methods but falls significantly short of supervised convolutional networks. This gap is acknowledged but not adequately analyzed or addressed. Additionally, the paper does not include comparisons to more recent self-supervised methods, such as contrastive learning approaches, which have set new benchmarks for unsupervised feature learning.
3. Claims and Scientific Rigor:  
   The theoretical claims are well-supported, with detailed proofs provided in the appendix. However, the empirical results do not fully substantiate the claim that BiGANs are "competitive with contemporary approaches." The paper would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation, including ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the encoder and discriminator, as well as comparisons to other bidirectional GAN frameworks.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Stronger Empirical Comparisons:  
   Include comparisons to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) and other bidirectional GAN variants like ALI. This would provide a clearer picture of where BiGANs stand in the current landscape of feature learning.
2. Analysis of Feature Quality:  
   Provide a deeper analysis of the learned features, such as visualizations of the latent space or quantitative metrics like clustering performance. This would help clarify how well BiGANs capture semantic information in the data.
3. Addressing Performance Gaps:  
   Investigate why BiGANs underperform compared to supervised networks and explore potential improvements, such as architectural modifications or alternative training objectives.
4. Ablation Studies:  
   Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of the encoder, generator, and discriminator to the overall performance. This would help isolate the impact of the bidirectional mapping.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed BiGAN framework compare to ALI in terms of both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance?
2. Can the authors provide insights into why BiGANs perform poorly relative to supervised convolutional networks for feature learning? Are there specific limitations in the architecture or training process?
3. Have the authors considered combining BiGANs with recent advancements in contrastive learning or other self-supervised techniques to improve feature quality?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting extension to GANs and provides a solid theoretical foundation, the empirical evaluation is insufficient to justify its claims of competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods. Addressing these limitations would significantly strengthen the paper.
