Summary of Contributions
This paper explores a novel application of the sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) for bioacoustic signal segmentation, specifically for identifying song units in humpback whale and multi-species bird recordings. The authors address the challenge of inferring the number of hidden states in bioacoustic data, a problem where ground truth is often unavailable. By leveraging the Bayesian non-parametric framework of HDP-HMM, the paper provides an unsupervised approach to segment bioacoustic signals into meaningful units. The results demonstrate the model's ability to identify song units in diverse datasets, offering a promising tool for ecological monitoring and species behavior analysis. The paper also highlights the limitations of the current implementation, such as computational inefficiency, and suggests future directions like hybrid models combining deep learning and graphical models.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting application of HDP-HMM to bioacoustics, it suffers from significant organizational and methodological issues that undermine its overall quality. The primary reasons for rejection are as follows:
1. Poor Paper Organization: The manuscript contains repetitive content, particularly in the abstract and introduction, which detracts from clarity and conciseness. Figures and tables are misplaced, disrupting the logical flow of the paper.
2. Methodological Concerns: The choice of Gibbs sampling for inference raises scalability issues, especially for larger datasets. More efficient methods like beam sampling or stochastic variational inference are not explored.
3. Feature Relevance: The use of MFCC features, which are calibrated to human auditory systems, is questionable for analyzing non-human bioacoustic signals. This choice may limit the ecological validity of the results.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Dataset Interest: The application of HDP-HMM to bioacoustic signal segmentation is novel, and the datasets (humpback whale and multi-species bird recordings) are interesting and relevant to ecological research. However, the structural and representational choices in the paper detract from its impact.
2. Scientific Rigor: While the HDP-HMM description is well-executed and aligns with existing literature, the paper does not sufficiently address the inconsistency of Dirichlet Process mixture models in estimating the true number of clusters. Additionally, the evaluation metrics (e.g., NMI scores) reveal significant discrepancies between model outputs and expert annotations, particularly for certain bird species.
3. Future Directions: The suggestion to explore hybrid models combining deep learning representations (e.g., LSTMs) with graphical models is promising and could address some of the current limitations.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Streamline Content: The abstract and introduction should be revised to remove redundancy and focus on the core contributions. Figures and tables should be appropriately placed to enhance readability (e.g., Figure 4 in the introduction, Figure 5 in the methods section, and Table 1 in the experiments section).
2. Scalability: Investigate more scalable inference methods, such as stochastic variational inference, to make the approach applicable to larger datasets.
3. Feature Selection: Consider using features more suited to non-human auditory systems, such as spectral features tailored to the frequency ranges of bird and whale vocalizations.
4. Evaluation: Provide a more detailed analysis of the discrepancies between model outputs and expert annotations. For example, discuss why the model struggles with certain species and how these challenges could be addressed in future work.
5. Broader Context: Discuss the ecological implications of the results in greater depth, particularly how the proposed method could aid in biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was Gibbs sampling chosen over more scalable methods like beam sampling or stochastic variational inference? Were computational constraints a factor?
2. How do you justify the use of MFCC features, given their calibration to human auditory systems? Have you considered alternative feature representations?
3. Can you elaborate on the potential ecological applications of your method, particularly in scenarios involving overlapping vocalizations from multiple species?
While the paper demonstrates potential, addressing the above issues is critical to improve its quality and impact.
