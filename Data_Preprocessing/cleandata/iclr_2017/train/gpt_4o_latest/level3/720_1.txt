Review of "Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations for Multi-Field Categorical Data"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces Cat2Vec, a novel method for learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data, with applications in recommender systems, computational advertising, and social link prediction. The proposed model employs neural gates (SUM/MULT) to compute pairwise interactions between category embeddings, followed by K-max pooling to select the most informative interactions. By repeating this process across multiple layers, the model captures higher-order interactions. The authors also propose a discriminant training method that distinguishes true samples from fake ones to learn category embeddings more effectively. The paper claims that Cat2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance in click-through rate (CTR) prediction, outperforming established baselines such as Logistic Regression, Factorization Machines, and deep neural networks (DNNs). The authors argue that traditional embedding methods like Word2Vec are unsuitable for multi-field categorical data due to the lack of explicit order relationships and the high dimensionality of categories.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting approach to modeling interactions in categorical data, it falls short in several critical areas that undermine its contributions. The lack of rigorous baseline comparisons and insufficient novelty in the proposed method are the primary reasons for this decision.
Supporting Arguments
1. Baseline Comparisons:  
   The paper does not provide a direct comparison between the proposed gated network and simpler architectures, such as convolutional or pooling-based networks, which could also capture interactions. Without such comparisons, it is unclear whether the observed performance gains are due to the proposed architecture or simply the increased model complexity. Additionally, there is no discussion of whether the baseline models and Cat2Vec have comparable parameter counts, which raises concerns about fairness in the evaluation.
2. Novelty:  
   While the use of gates and K-max pooling for interaction modeling is interesting, the underlying ideas are not particularly novel. The approach is conceptually similar to existing methods in association rule mining (e.g., Apriori) and neural interaction models. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from prior work, particularly in the context of deep learning for CTR prediction.
3. Empirical Validation:  
   Although the authors claim state-of-the-art performance, the experimental results lack sufficient rigor. For example, the improvement over baselines like FNN and CCPM is modest (~1.7% in accuracy), and the paper does not explore whether this gain is statistically significant. Furthermore, the choice of hyperparameters and dropout rates appears arbitrary, with limited justification provided.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Baseline Comparisons:  
   Include experiments comparing Cat2Vec to simpler architectures (e.g., convolutional/pooling-based networks) with similar parameter counts. This would help isolate the benefits of the proposed gates and K-max pooling.
2. Ablation Studies:  
   Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the individual contributions of gates, K-max pooling, and the discriminant training method. For example, compare the performance of the model with and without K-max pooling.
3. Statistical Significance:  
   Report statistical significance tests (e.g., t-tests) to validate the observed performance improvements over baselines.
4. Clarity and Novelty:  
   Clearly articulate how Cat2Vec differs from existing methods, particularly in terms of novelty. Highlight specific scenarios where Cat2Vec is expected to outperform traditional methods like Word2Vec or FNN.
5. Parameter Comparisons:  
   Provide a detailed comparison of the parameter counts for Cat2Vec and baseline models to ensure fairness in the evaluation.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of Cat2Vec compare to simpler convolutional or pooling-based architectures?  
2. Are the parameter counts of Cat2Vec and the baseline models comparable? If not, how do you account for this in your evaluation?  
3. What is the rationale for the specific choice of gates (SUM/MULT)? Did you experiment with other gating mechanisms, and if so, how did they perform?  
4. Can you provide more details on the statistical significance of the reported performance improvements?  
5. How does the model handle scalability for datasets with very high-dimensional categorical fields?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach, it requires stronger empirical validation, clearer novelty claims, and more rigorous comparisons to justify its contributions.
