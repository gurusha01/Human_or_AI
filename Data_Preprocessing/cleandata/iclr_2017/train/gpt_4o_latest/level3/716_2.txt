Review of "ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation"
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes ENet, a real-time semantic segmentation network designed specifically for embedded systems and mobile applications. The authors claim that ENet achieves significant speed and resource efficiency, being up to 18× faster and requiring 75× fewer FLOPs than existing models, while maintaining comparable accuracy. The architecture is based on an encoder-decoder design and incorporates techniques such as indexed pooling, dilated convolutions, and PReLU activations to optimize performance and memory usage. The authors highlight ENet's practical value by demonstrating its performance on NVIDIA TX1 embedded systems and public datasets like Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D.
Decision: Reject  
Key Reasons:
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper primarily combines pre-existing techniques (e.g., indexed pooling, dilated convolutions, PReLU) without introducing significant innovation. While the integration of these techniques is effective, it does not meet the bar for novel contributions expected at a top-tier conference like ICLR.
2. Weak Experimental Rigor: The design choices are ad-hoc, with no ablation studies to validate the importance of individual components. Additionally, the performance comparison is against a weak baseline (SegNet), and ENet does not achieve state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Innovation: Most of the components used in ENet are well-established in the literature. While the authors emphasize the practical efficiency of their model, the lack of novel architectural contributions or theoretical insights limits the paper's impact.
2. Weak Baseline and Performance Trade-offs: The comparison to SegNet, which is not state-of-the-art, undermines the significance of the reported results. Furthermore, while ENet achieves impressive speed and model size (0.7MB), this comes at the cost of significant performance drops on some benchmarks, particularly in terms of global accuracy and IoU on datasets like SUN RGB-D.
3. Insufficient Analysis: The paper does not analyze critical aspects such as memory consumption during inference, which is essential for embedded systems. Additionally, the trade-off between model size and accuracy is not thoroughly explored.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation experiments to validate the contribution of individual design choices (e.g., indexed pooling, dilated convolutions, PReLU) to the overall performance and efficiency of ENet.
2. Stronger Baselines: Compare ENet against more competitive state-of-the-art models to better contextualize its performance. This would strengthen the claim of practical utility.
3. Memory Analysis: Include a detailed analysis of memory consumption during inference, as this is critical for embedded systems.
4. Trade-off Exploration: Provide a deeper exploration of the trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy. For example, how does ENet perform when slightly increasing model size to improve accuracy?
5. Broader Applications: While the focus on embedded systems is valuable, demonstrating ENet's applicability to other use cases (e.g., cloud-based real-time processing) could broaden its impact.
Questions for Authors
1. Can you provide ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of individual components (e.g., dilated convolutions, PReLU) on ENet's performance?
2. Why was SegNet chosen as the primary baseline, given that it is not state-of-the-art? How does ENet compare to more recent models like DeepLab or PSPNet in terms of both speed and accuracy?
3. What is the memory consumption of ENet during inference on embedded systems, and how does it compare to other models?
4. Could ENet's performance be improved by slightly increasing the model size, and if so, what would be the trade-offs?
In summary, while ENet demonstrates practical value for real-time semantic segmentation on embedded systems, the lack of novelty, weak experimental rigor, and insufficient analysis make it unsuitable for acceptance at this time. Addressing the above concerns could significantly strengthen the paper.
