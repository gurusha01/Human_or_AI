Review of the Paper
Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel formulation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) called Differentiable CCA, which is designed to be incorporated as a layer within multi-view neural networks. The authors claim that their approach enables gradient flow through the computation of CCA projection matrices, allowing for direct optimization of task-specific objectives (e.g., cosine distance for cross-modality retrieval). They evaluate their method on cross-modality retrieval tasks using two public datasets (Flickr30k and IAPR TC-12) and report improved retrieval performance compared to Deep CCA (DCCA) and other baselines. The authors suggest that Differentiable CCA could serve as a useful building block for multi-modality tasks.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected due to the following key reasons:
1. Unclear Contribution: The claimed contribution of enabling back-propagation through CCA is not convincingly demonstrated to be novel. Deep CCA (Andrew et al., 2013) already provides gradient derivations for the correlation objective, and the distinction between the proposed method and DCCA is insufficiently articulated.
2. Confusing Claims: The claim that the proposed differentiable version allows direct back-propagation through CCA computation is unclear, as the authors do not adequately explain how their approach differs fundamentally from existing methods like DCCA.
3. Lack of Rigorous Support for Claims: While the experimental results show some improvement in retrieval tasks, the paper does not provide sufficient theoretical or empirical evidence to justify the claimed advantages of Differentiable CCA over DCCA.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Unclear Novelty: The paper does not adequately distinguish its contributions from prior work. DCCA already allows for gradient-based optimization of nonlinear transformations, and the paper does not convincingly demonstrate how Differentiable CCA extends this capability in a meaningful way. The discussion of gradient computation through the CCA projection matrices is overly technical but lacks clarity on why this is a novel or necessary improvement.
2. Confusing Terminology: The claim that the proposed method "enables gradient flow through the computation of the CCA projection matrices" is confusing. DCCA already achieves gradient flow for optimizing the correlation objective, and the authors do not clearly articulate why their method is fundamentally different or better.
3. Empirical Results: While the results on cross-modality retrieval tasks show modest improvements, the gains are incremental and could be attributed to differences in optimization strategies or hyperparameter tuning rather than the proposed method itself. Additionally, the experiments lack ablation studies to isolate the impact of the differentiable CCA layer.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify the Contribution: The authors should clearly articulate how Differentiable CCA differs from and improves upon DCCA. Specifically, they should explain why the ability to back-propagate through the CCA projection matrices is a meaningful and novel contribution.
2. Provide Theoretical Insights: A more rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method is needed to justify its claims. For example, the authors could provide proofs or derivations showing how their approach enables optimization of objectives that DCCA cannot handle.
3. Ablation Studies: The experimental section would benefit from ablation studies to isolate the impact of the differentiable CCA layer. For example, the authors could compare their method to DCCA under identical experimental setups to highlight the specific advantages of their approach.
4. Broader Evaluation: The authors should evaluate their method on additional tasks or datasets to demonstrate its general applicability and robustness.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does Differentiable CCA fundamentally differ from DCCA in terms of gradient computation and optimization capabilities? Can you provide a clear and concise explanation?
2. Why is back-propagating through the CCA projection matrices necessary or advantageous compared to optimizing the correlation objective as in DCCA?
3. Can you provide ablation studies or additional experiments to isolate the impact of the differentiable CCA layer on retrieval performance?
In its current form, the paper lacks clarity and rigor in its claims and contributions, and the experimental results do not sufficiently support the novelty or significance of the proposed method.
