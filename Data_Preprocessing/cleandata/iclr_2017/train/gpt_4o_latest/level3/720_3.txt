Review of "Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations for Multi-Field Categorical Data"
The paper presents "Cat2Vec," a novel method for learning distributed representations of multi-field categorical data. The proposed approach computes pairwise interactions between category embeddings using neural gates, applies non-linear transformations, and selects the most informative interactions via K-Max pooling. By iteratively repeating this process, the model captures higher-order interactions, which are shown to improve performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks, such as click-through rate (CTR) prediction. The authors also propose a discriminant training method to enhance the model's ability to distinguish real from synthetic samples. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting approach, it falls short in several critical areas, including insufficient motivation, lack of clarity in its connection to existing work, and incomplete comparisons with related methods. These shortcomings undermine the paper's scientific rigor and its contribution to the field.
Supporting Arguments for Decision:
1. Motivation and General Applicability:  
   The paper claims to address multi-field categorical data but does not convincingly justify why the proposed method is particularly suited to this data type. The approach is general and could be applied to any embeddings, raising questions about its specific relevance to categorical data. The lack of a clear connection between the method and the unique challenges of categorical data weakens the motivation.
2. Lack of Discussion on Related Work:  
   The proposed method bears structural similarities to Compact Bilinear Pooling (CBP) and Convolutional Click Prediction Models (CCPM). However, the paper does not adequately discuss these methods or clarify how Cat2Vec differs conceptually or practically. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty of the approach.
3. Comparison Gap:  
   While the experimental results are promising, the paper does not compare Cat2Vec against CBP or other advanced pooling mechanisms, which are natural baselines given the method's design. Without such comparisons, it is unclear whether the observed improvements are due to the proposed method or simply the use of additional interaction layers.
4. Theoretical Justification:  
   The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of why the K-Max pooling mechanism is optimal for selecting informative interactions. While the empirical results are compelling, a deeper theoretical grounding would strengthen the claims.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify Motivation:  
   Provide a stronger justification for why the proposed method is particularly well-suited for multi-field categorical data. Highlight the challenges of this data type and explicitly connect them to the design choices in Cat2Vec.
2. Expand Related Work Discussion:  
   Include a detailed comparison with CBP, CCPM, and other related methods. Discuss the conceptual similarities and differences, and explain why Cat2Vec is a meaningful advancement.
3. Broader Experimental Comparisons:  
   Incorporate additional baselines, such as CBP, and evaluate the method on a wider range of datasets. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses.
4. Theoretical Insights:  
   Include a theoretical analysis of the K-Max pooling mechanism and its role in capturing significant interactions. This would add depth to the paper and support its empirical findings.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does Cat2Vec differ conceptually from CBP and CCPM, and why were these methods not included as baselines in your experiments?
2. What specific challenges of multi-field categorical data does Cat2Vec address that existing methods do not?
3. Can you provide a theoretical justification for the use of K-Max pooling in selecting informative interactions?
In summary, while the paper introduces a potentially impactful method, its lack of sufficient motivation, incomplete discussion of related work, and limited experimental comparisons prevent it from meeting the standards of this conference. Addressing these issues would significantly strengthen the paper.
