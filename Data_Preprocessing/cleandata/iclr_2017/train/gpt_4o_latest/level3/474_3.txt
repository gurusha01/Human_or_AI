The paper proposes a novel framework, MUS-ROVER II, for learning compositional rules in music generation using a teacher-student model. The generative component (student) employs Probabilistic Graphical Models to create music, while the discriminative component (teacher) refines rules by comparing generated music with exemplar music. Unlike GANs, the system is interpretable, emphasizing hierarchical rule learning and adaptive memory selection. The paper claims that MUS-ROVER II achieves deeper interpretability and dynamic rule learning, making it suitable for music education and style recognition.
Decision: Reject.  
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of rigorous evaluation against baselines and the paper's poor accessibility due to unclear explanations and excessive technical jargon.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Evaluation Concerns: The paper does not compare MUS-ROVER II with its predecessor or other baseline models, such as LSTMs or GAN-based approaches. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess the system's relative performance or its claimed advantages in interpretability and rule learning. The absence of quantitative metrics further weakens the empirical validation of the proposed framework.  
2. Clarity Issues: The paper is challenging to follow due to its reliance on dense music theory terminology and over-complicated mathematical descriptions. Key concepts like "feature hierarchy" and "informational hierarchy" are insufficiently explained, making it hard to grasp their significance or implementation. This lack of clarity hinders the accessibility of the work to a broader audience, including those outside the intersection of music and AI.  
Additional Feedback for Improvement:  
1. Baseline Comparisons: The authors should include experiments comparing MUS-ROVER II with its predecessor and other models (e.g., LSTMs, GANs). Metrics such as interpretability, rule recovery accuracy, and music quality (evaluated by human experts) would strengthen the paper's claims.  
2. Simplify Explanations: The paper would benefit from clearer and more concise explanations of its core concepts. For instance, using illustrative examples or diagrams to explain "feature hierarchy" and "informational hierarchy" could make these ideas more accessible.  
3. Broader Evaluation: While the system is tested on Bach's chorales, exploring its performance on other datasets or genres could demonstrate its generalizability.  
4. Accessibility: Reducing the reliance on domain-specific jargon and providing a glossary for key terms would make the paper more approachable for non-expert readers.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does MUS-ROVER II compare to MUS-ROVER I in terms of rule recovery and music quality?  
2. Why were LSTM-based or GAN-based models not included as baselines for comparison?  
3. Could you provide a more intuitive explanation of the conceptual and informational hierarchies? How do they contribute to the system's interpretability?  
4. How does the system handle musical styles outside of Bach's chorales? Can it generalize to other genres or composers?  
In summary, while the proposed framework is promising and emphasizes interpretability, the lack of rigorous evaluation and the paper's inaccessibility significantly limit its impact. Addressing these issues could make the work more compelling for future submissions.
