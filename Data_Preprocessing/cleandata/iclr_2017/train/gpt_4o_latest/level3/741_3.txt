Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn game concepts in tic-tac-toe under weak supervision. The authors train a CNN to classify 1029 tic-tac-toe boards into 18 categories, achieving 100% accuracy. They employ Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to visualize the network's focus, demonstrating that the CNN identifies critical empty squares and contextual board elements to predict the next winning move. The paper claims that this setup reveals the emergence of game concepts such as grid structure, winning rules, and turn-taking without explicit supervision. Additionally, the authors argue that CAM can activate in non-salient regions, showcasing the CNN's ability to hierarchically gather contextual information. The study also examines the robustness of the model to variations in board and piece appearances, as well as the network's learning dynamics over time.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the limited novelty of the work and the contrived nature of the experimental setup. While the paper demonstrates interesting results in a controlled environment, its contributions are incremental and lack broader applicability to more complex or real-world scenarios.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Novelty: The paper's claims about discovering game rules and concepts are overstated. The task of predicting the next winning move in tic-tac-toe is inherently simple, and the use of a CNN for this purpose does not represent a significant advancement. The application of CAM to visualize attention is well-established, and the claim that CAM can activate in non-salient regions is not particularly surprising in this context, given the simplicity of the dataset.
   
2. Contrived Setup: The use of a CNN for a task as simple as tic-tac-toe feels unnecessarily complex. The dataset and task are highly artificial, and the insights gained may not generalize to more challenging problems. The study does not convincingly demonstrate how its findings contribute to broader topics such as weakly supervised or multi-modal learning.
3. Relevance to Broader Contexts: The paper attempts to connect its findings to deep reinforcement learning and cross-modal supervision, but these connections are tenuous. The study does not address how its results could be extended to more complex games or tasks, limiting its impact.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Applicability: The authors should consider extending their methodology to more complex games or scenarios where the rules and strategies are less explicit. This would make the findings more relevant to the broader AI community.
   
2. Stronger Positioning in Literature: The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing works in weakly supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Demonstrating how this work advances the state of the art in these fields is critical.
   
3. Improved Writing: While the paper is generally well-written, there are some grammatical errors that should be addressed. Clarity and conciseness could also be improved, particularly in the methodology and results sections.
4. Quantitative Depth: The quantitative evaluation is limited. Metrics like representation accuracy (RAC) and representation consistency (RCO) are introduced but not sufficiently contextualized. A more rigorous analysis of the network's generalization ability and robustness would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed methodology scale to more complex games or tasks where the rules are not as explicit as in tic-tac-toe?
2. Can the authors provide more evidence or experiments to support the claim that the CNN has "learned" game concepts rather than simply memorizing patterns in the dataset?
3. How does this work contribute to the fields of weakly supervised or multi-modal learning beyond the specific tic-tac-toe example?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting application of CAM and CNNs to a toy problem, its limited novelty, contrived setup, and lack of broader relevance make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. The authors are encouraged to address these concerns and explore more impactful applications of their approach.
