Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel method for mining logical rules directly from relational embeddings, extending prior work by enabling the discovery of more expressive logical theories. The authors frame rule mining as a sparse recovery problem in the embedding space and leverage compressed sensing techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to extract rules. The method supports conjunction, disjunction, and negation, offering a more comprehensive logical framework than prior approaches. Empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed method outperforms kNN-based rule miners in terms of F-score and per-rule recall across multiple knowledge bases. The authors also highlight the potential for improved scalability and generalization through the use of relational embeddings.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting approach to rule mining from embeddings, it falls short in several critical areas that undermine its contribution. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of clear motivation for mining rules from embedding spaces and insufficient empirical evidence to support the claims of improved performance and interpretability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Context: The paper does not adequately explain why mining rules from embedding spaces is a meaningful or necessary extension of existing rule mining techniques. While the authors highlight the limitations of classical ILP methods, they fail to establish the practical significance of embedding-based rule mining beyond theoretical interest.
2. Empirical Evidence: The experimental results are unconvincing. Figures 1 and 2 lack baseline comparisons, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's performance relative to established techniques. Additionally, the absence of link prediction results undermines the claim that the learned rules improve knowledge base completion.
3. Interpretability and Debugging: The paper asserts that the proposed method yields interpretable and diverse rules, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate this claim. Figure 3, which aims to demonstrate the utility of the learned rules, fails to convincingly show how these rules contribute to interpretability or debugging.
4. Scalability: The scalability of the proposed method is a significant limitation. The authors acknowledge the exponential growth of candidate rule bodies but defer the solution to future work. This undermines the practicality of the approach for large-scale knowledge bases.
Additional Feedback
1. Baseline Comparisons: Including comparisons with state-of-the-art rule mining methods, such as AMIE or lifted RP, would strengthen the empirical evaluation and provide a clearer picture of the method's relative performance.
2. Motivation and Use Cases: The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential applications where embedding-based rule mining offers unique advantages over classical methods.
3. Scalability Improvements: Addressing scalability concerns, even partially, would make the method more practical. For example, demonstrating the use of online recovery algorithms or other techniques to reduce computational overhead would be valuable.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Beyond F-score and per-rule recall, additional metrics such as runtime, memory usage, and interpretability scores could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide a concrete example or use case where mining rules from embeddings significantly outperforms traditional rule mining approaches in terms of practical utility?
2. How does the proposed method handle noise in the embeddings, and how does this affect the quality of the mined rules?
3. What steps can be taken to address the scalability issues, and how do you envision the method being applied to large-scale knowledge bases like YAGO or DBpedia?
In conclusion, while the paper introduces an innovative approach to rule mining, the lack of clarity in motivation, insufficient empirical validation, and scalability concerns make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the paper's impact and contribution to the field.
