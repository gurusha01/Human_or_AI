The paper introduces a novel modification to Gatys et al.'s parametric texture synthesis model, addressing its inability to capture long-range texture correlations. By incorporating Gram matrices of spatially shifted feature vectors, the proposed method enhances the synthesis of textures with structured long-range correlations, such as brick patterns. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through a variety of experiments, including applications to texture generation, inpainting, and season transfer. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and comprehensive experimental results.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its simple yet effective modification of an established method, which significantly improves the synthesis of structured textures. While not a groundbreaking contribution, the work is a meaningful step forward in texture synthesis and addresses a key limitation of Gatys et al.'s approach.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Specific Problem Tackled: The paper addresses the inability of Gatys et al.'s method to model long-range spatial correlations in textures. This is a well-defined and relevant problem in the field of texture synthesis.
2. Well-Motivated Approach: The proposed modification is grounded in prior work and builds logically on Gatys et al.'s method. The use of spatially shifted Gram matrices is both intuitive and computationally feasible, making it a practical extension.
3. Empirical Validation: The results convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority in synthesizing structured textures, such as bricks, and its applicability to inpainting and style transfer. The visual comparisons with Gatys et al.'s method are compelling.
Additional Feedback:
1. Variability of Generated Samples: As noted, the method shares a limitation with Gatys et al.'s approach, where the global minimum of the objective is the original image itself. While the authors partially address this through inpainting experiments, further discussion or exploration of alternative solutions would strengthen the paper. For example, could regularization techniques or alternative loss formulations mitigate this issue?
2. Parameter Sensitivity: The choice of the δ parameter for spatial translations is critical but appears somewhat ad hoc. A more systematic analysis or automated selection process for δ values would improve the robustness of the method.
3. Computational Overhead: The authors note an 80% increase in generation time due to the additional loss terms. While this is acceptable for research purposes, a discussion on potential optimizations or trade-offs would be valuable for practical applications.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method perform on textures with less regular but still structured patterns (e.g., natural textures like tree bark or stone)?
2. Could the approach be extended to incorporate other types of transformations beyond translations and flips, such as rotations or scaling? If so, what challenges might arise?
3. Have the authors considered using alternative optimization techniques or initialization strategies to address the variability of generated samples?
In conclusion, the paper presents a well-motivated and empirically validated contribution to texture synthesis. While there are areas for improvement, the proposed method is a valuable addition to the field and merits publication.
