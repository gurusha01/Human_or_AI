Review
Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces TreNet, a hybrid neural network architecture combining 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and a feature fusion layer for predicting local trends in time series data. The authors argue that local trends, characterized by slope and duration, are more informative than point predictions in applications such as stock trading and energy management. TreNet extracts local features using CNNs and long-term dependencies using LSTMs, combining these representations for trend forecasting. The paper demonstrates TreNet's superiority over baseline methods, including standalone CNNs, LSTMs, support vector regression (SVR), and pattern-based hidden Markov models (pHMM), across three real-world datasets. The results show that TreNet achieves lower root mean square error (RMSE) in trend prediction tasks.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a promising hybrid architecture and achieves competitive results, it has significant methodological and presentation flaws that undermine its scientific rigor and practical relevance. The key reasons for rejection are:
1. Methodology Flaws: The paper treats slope and duration predictions independently, whereas these should be modeled jointly with a combined loss function to capture their inherent correlation.
2. Baseline Inconsistencies: The baselines are not uniformly implemented. For instance, the SVM baseline uses concatenated inputs, while CNN and LSTM baselines do not. A direct CNN-to-LSTM baseline without ad-hoc trend extraction is also missing.
3. Application Relevance: The evaluation lacks real-world metrics, such as trading profit/loss, to assess the practical utility of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
1. Prediction Horizon: The paper does not specify the prediction horizon for time series trends, which is critical for interpreting the results and ensuring meaningful comparisons with baselines.
2. Trend Extraction Analysis: The trend extraction technique is not rigorously evaluated, leaving questions about its reliability and generalizability to other datasets.
3. Architecture Analysis: The paper does not analyze the role of CNN filters or the learned trend representations, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each component.
4. Missing Baseline: A simple baseline that predicts the next trend as the previous trend (na√Øve baseline) is absent, which is a standard benchmark in time series forecasting.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Supervised Loss for Trend Prediction: Adding an auxiliary supervised loss for the CNN's trend prediction could improve the model's ability to capture local features.
2. Paper Organization: The appendix content on trend variance should be moved to the main paper, as it is essential for understanding the results. Redundant details in Section 4 can be condensed to improve readability.
3. Dataset Details: The number of data points in each dataset and the distribution of local trends should be clarified to ensure reproducibility.
4. Missing References: The paper omits key references on hybrid CNN-LSTM models from 2014, which would strengthen its positioning in the literature.
5. Typographical Errors: Fix the typo on page 5 ("duration and slop").
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were slope and duration predictions treated independently? Would a joint loss function improve performance?
2. Can you provide a baseline that directly connects CNN to LSTM without ad-hoc trend extraction?
3. How does the choice of trend extraction method affect the results? Have you tested alternative segmentation techniques?
4. What is the prediction horizon for the reported results, and how does it compare to baselines?
5. Can you evaluate TreNet's practical utility using application-specific metrics, such as trading profit/loss?
In summary, while TreNet is a novel and promising approach, the paper requires significant improvements in methodology, evaluation, and presentation to meet the standards of the conference.
