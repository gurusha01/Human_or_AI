Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the geometry of preimages of specific activity vectors in hidden layers of fully connected multilayer rectifier networks. The authors demonstrate that these preimages form piecewise linear manifolds in the input space, providing a procedure to compute them. The paper argues that understanding these preimages is essential for efficient classification and could serve as building blocks for modeling input manifolds specific to classes. The authors also discuss implications for convolutional networks, highlighting that preimages are "well-behaved" and semantically consistent with the input. By formalizing the preimage concept, the paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how deep networks achieve efficient classification and dimensionality reduction.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses an interesting and underexplored problem, it lacks sufficient theoretical novelty and practical applicability to warrant acceptance. The work is largely preliminary, with limited insights beyond existing literature. The absence of empirical validation or concrete applications further weakens its contribution.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Depth: The paper's primary contribution—characterizing preimages as piecewise linear manifolds—is not entirely novel. Similar ideas have been explored in prior works, such as those by Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015, 2016) and Montufar et al. (2014). While the authors extend these ideas, the theoretical insights remain incremental rather than groundbreaking.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The paper lacks empirical results to support its claims. For instance, the authors do not compute or visualize preimages for real-world networks or datasets, which would have strengthened their arguments about the practical relevance of preimages in understanding neural networks.
3. Practical Applications: The paper does not propose clear applications for its findings. While the authors suggest that preimages could enhance training efficiency or help model class manifolds, these claims remain speculative and are not substantiated by experiments or concrete methodologies.
4. Alternative Approaches: The paper focuses exclusively on a geometric perspective but does not explore alternative approaches, such as inductive or probabilistic methods, which could provide complementary insights into the problem.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Empirical Analysis: Include experiments that compute and visualize preimages for real-world datasets and networks. For example, demonstrating how preimages differ across layers or how they relate to class separation would add significant value.
   
2. Practical Applications: Explore concrete applications of preimages, such as improving training algorithms, detecting adversarial examples, or analyzing class separability. Providing even preliminary results in these areas would make the work more impactful.
3. Comparison with Existing Work: Clearly articulate how this work advances beyond prior studies, such as those by Mahendran & Vedaldi or Montufar et al. A more detailed discussion of the limitations of existing methods and how this paper addresses them would strengthen its positioning.
4. Broader Scope: Consider extending the analysis to convolutional networks in greater detail, as they are more commonly used in practice. Investigating how pooling layers affect preimages could also provide new insights.
5. Alternative Perspectives: Explore inductive or probabilistic approaches to complement the geometric analysis. This could provide a more holistic understanding of preimages and their role in neural networks.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do preimages evolve across layers in a deep network? Are there empirical patterns that could validate the theoretical claims?
2. Can the authors provide examples of how preimages could be used to improve training efficiency or detect adversarial examples?
3. How does the proposed procedure for computing preimages scale to large networks and datasets?
4. What specific advantages does the geometric perspective offer over alternative approaches, such as optimization-based methods?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an intriguing topic, it requires significant theoretical, empirical, and practical development to make a substantial contribution to the field.
