Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel bioacoustic representation based on the Fast Chirplet Transform (FCT) and demonstrates its utility in pretraining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for bioacoustic classification tasks. The authors propose FCT as a trade-off between handcrafted feature engineering and fully data-driven feature learning, arguing that it provides a computationally efficient, bioinspired auditory representation. The paper presents the first algorithm and implementation of FCT, validates its computational efficiency on large datasets (e.g., bird and whale recordings), and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving CNN training speed and classification performance on both bird species and vowel datasets. Notably, FCT pretraining reduces training time by 26–28% and improves classification accuracy by 2.3–7.8% compared to raw audio-based CNNs. The authors also discuss potential applications in interspecies bioacoustic transfer learning and tonotopic deep learning architectures.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting and novel approach, it does not fully meet the scientific rigor and clarity required for acceptance. The primary reasons for rejection are (1) insufficient justification for the use of Chirplets over other feature representations, and (2) lack of evidence that the proposed approach generalizes beyond the specific datasets used. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address the criticisms of feature engineering and does not convincingly position FCT within the broader literature on feature learning.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Motivation and Positioning in Literature: The paper does not sufficiently justify why Chirplets are the optimal representation for bioacoustic tasks. While the authors cite neurobiological evidence, they do not compare FCT with other established feature representations (e.g., Mel spectrograms, scattering transforms) in terms of generalization or robustness. The claim that FCT is a trade-off between feature engineering and data-driven learning is not well substantiated, as the approach still relies on handcrafted parameters (e.g., Chirplet filter bank design).
2. Scientific Rigor and Generalization: The experiments focus on relatively small and specific datasets (e.g., Bird10, TIMIT vowels), which limits the generalizability of the results. The authors do not evaluate FCT on larger or more diverse datasets, nor do they explore its performance in real-world noisy conditions. Additionally, the reported gains in training speed and accuracy, while promising, are incremental and may not justify the added complexity of incorporating FCT into CNN pipelines.
3. Criticism of Feature Engineering: The paper criticizes feature engineering but does not convincingly demonstrate that FCT overcomes its limitations. The reliance on predefined Chirplet parameters suggests that the approach still involves significant manual design. Furthermore, the authors do not explore whether end-to-end learning from raw audio could achieve comparable or superior results with sufficient data.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Dataset Expansion: To strengthen the claims of generalizability, the authors should evaluate FCT on larger, more diverse datasets, including real-world noisy recordings. Collecting additional data from zoos or natural environments, as suggested, could provide a more robust evaluation.
2. Comparison with End-to-End Learning: The paper should include a direct comparison between FCT-pretrained CNNs and fully end-to-end models trained on raw audio. This would clarify whether the proposed approach offers significant advantages over purely data-driven methods.
3. Theoretical Justification: The authors should provide a stronger theoretical justification for the use of Chirplets, including a comparison with other time-frequency representations (e.g., wavelets, Mel spectrograms). Highlighting specific advantages of Chirplets in terms of sparsity, denoising, or biological relevance would strengthen the motivation.
4. Task-Specific Relevance: The use of Chirplets for bioacoustic tasks is intriguing, but the authors should clarify how this representation aligns with task-specific requirements. For example, how does FCT handle weak signal-to-noise ratios or overlapping vocalizations in complex environments?
Questions for the Authors
1. How does FCT compare with other feature representations (e.g., Mel spectrograms, scattering transforms) in terms of robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency?
2. Could the proposed approach be integrated into an end-to-end learning framework, where Chirplet parameters are learned directly from data?
3. Have you evaluated the performance of FCT-pretrained CNNs on larger or noisier datasets? If not, how do you plan to address this limitation in future work?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an innovative approach, it requires additional validation, theoretical grounding, and broader comparisons to meet the standards of this conference.
