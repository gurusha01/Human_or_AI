Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks, with a focus on both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples. The authors provide a novel contribution by conducting experiments on large-scale models (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50/101/152) and datasets (ImageNet), as well as a black-box system (Clarifai.com). The paper identifies that while non-targeted adversarial examples transfer effectively, targeted adversarial examples rarely transfer using existing methods. To address this, the authors propose an ensemble-based optimization approach, which significantly improves the transferability of targeted adversarial examples for the first time. Additionally, the paper explores geometric properties of decision boundaries to better understand adversarial transferability and demonstrates the practical implications of their findings by successfully attacking Clarifai.com.
Decision: Reject
While the paper addresses an important and timely problem, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons: (1) limited novelty in the proposed ensemble-based optimization approach, and (2) methodological and presentation shortcomings that detract from the paper's overall impact and clarity.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Novelty: The ensemble-based optimization approach, while effective, is a relatively incremental improvement over existing methods. The idea of leveraging multiple models to enhance transferability is intuitive and has been explored in prior works, albeit in different contexts. The paper does not provide sufficient theoretical or methodological innovation to justify its contribution as a significant advancement.
2. Methodological Concerns: 
   - The authors treat ResNet-based models as independent entities despite their architectural similarities, which undermines the meaningfulness of certain comparisons.
   - The evaluation of black-box attacks relies on subjective measures, particularly for Clarifai.com, raising concerns about fairness and reproducibility.
   - The question of using \( f(x) \) versus \( J(x) \) in Equation (7) is not adequately addressed, suggesting potential inefficiencies in the gradient descent process.
3. Presentation Issues:
   - The paper is overly lengthy, with redundant sections (e.g., overlap between Sections 1 and 2.3) that could be pruned for clarity and conciseness.
   - The discussion of related work is insufficient, particularly regarding Fawzi et al. (NIPS 2016), whose findings could provide valuable context for the geometric studies.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Methodology: Provide a more rigorous justification for treating ResNet models as independent and address the potential inefficiencies in Equation (7). Consider including additional quantitative metrics for black-box attack evaluations to reduce reliance on subjective measures.
2. Strengthen Related Work: Expand the discussion of prior research, particularly Fawzi et al. (2016), to better contextualize the geometric findings and highlight the novelty of the proposed approach.
3. Prune Redundancies: Streamline the paper by removing overlaps between sections and focusing on the most critical contributions and findings.
4. Enhance Novelty: Explore additional theoretical insights or methodological innovations to distinguish the ensemble-based approach from prior work.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you justify treating ResNet-based models as independent, given their architectural similarities? Would combining them in the ensemble lead to different results?
2. Can you provide quantitative metrics for evaluating black-box attacks on Clarifai.com to complement the subjective measures?
3. What specific challenges did you encounter when implementing the ensemble-based approach, and how were they addressed?
4. How does your work compare to Fawzi et al. (2016) in terms of geometric insights? Could their findings be integrated into your analysis?
In conclusion, while the paper provides valuable insights into adversarial transferability and proposes a practical ensemble-based approach, its limited novelty and methodological shortcomings prevent it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this time. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
