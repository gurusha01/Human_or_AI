Review of the Paper: "Efficient Pruning of Convolutional Neural Networks Using Taylor Expansion"
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel pruning strategy for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on a Taylor expansion criterion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by removing network parameters. The approach is computationally efficient, leveraging first-order gradient information to identify parameters with minimal impact on accuracy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in transfer learning scenarios, achieving significant reductions in floating-point operations (FLOPs) with minimal accuracy loss on fine-grained classification tasks (e.g., Birds-200, Flowers-102) and large-scale datasets like ImageNet. The paper also highlights the superiority of the Taylor criterion over existing methods, such as weight magnitude or activation-based pruning, and provides empirical comparisons with Optimal Brain Damage (OBD). The method is validated on AlexNet, VGG-16, and a recurrent 3D-CNN, showing flexibility and scalability.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is technically sound and introduces a promising pruning strategy, it lacks critical comparisons and clarity in certain areas, which limits its overall contribution. Specifically, the absence of a direct comparison with the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) framework in terms of accuracy and computational trade-offs weakens the empirical validation. Additionally, the results for AlexNet and VGG-16 are reported on different datasets, making it difficult to generalize the findings. These shortcomings, along with the need for further analysis of pruning versus lower precision computation, prevent the paper from meeting the acceptance threshold.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Comparison with Optimal Brain Damage (OBD): The authors claim that OBD is computationally inefficient, but this assertion is not rigorously substantiated. Back-of-envelope calculations suggest that OBD could be competitive with the proposed method. A direct empirical comparison in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and pruning efficiency is necessary to validate this claim.
   
2. Dataset Consistency: Results for AlexNet and VGG-16 are reported on different datasets (Flowers-102 and Birds-200, respectively). This inconsistency makes it challenging to assess the generalizability of the proposed method across architectures and tasks. Reporting results for both networks on both datasets would strengthen the analysis.
3. Pruning vs. Lower Precision Computation: The paper focuses solely on pruning but does not explore the trade-offs or complementarity with lower precision computation. A comparison in terms of GFLOPs and accuracy would provide valuable insights into the broader applicability of the method.
4. Clarity on Fine-Tuning Iterations: It is unclear whether the reported accuracy comparisons account for additional fine-tuning iterations (N+M vs. N iterations). This ambiguity makes it difficult to interpret the results and assess the practical implications of the method.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Include a Rigorous Comparison with OBD: Provide detailed empirical results comparing the proposed method with OBD in terms of accuracy, computational cost, and pruning efficiency. This would address the current gap in the analysis and strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Consistent Dataset Usage: Report results for both AlexNet and VGG-16 on the same datasets (e.g., Birds-200 and Flowers-102) to enable a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's generalizability.
3. Analyze Pruning vs. Lower Precision Computation: Explore the trade-offs between pruning and lower precision computation, particularly in terms of GFLOPs and accuracy. This would position the method within the broader context of model compression techniques.
4. Clarify Fine-Tuning Details: Clearly specify whether accuracy comparisons account for additional fine-tuning iterations. If so, provide a breakdown of the number of iterations used for each experiment.
5. Explore Modified Criteria: Investigate the potential of combining the Taylor criterion with a weighted feature activation term, as suggested in the review guidelines. While this may require additional parameter tuning, it could yield improved results.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare with OBD in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly when implemented with modern frameworks?
2. Can you provide results for AlexNet and VGG-16 on both Birds-200 and Flowers-102 datasets to ensure consistency in the evaluation?
3. Have you considered the trade-offs between pruning and lower precision computation? If so, how does the proposed method complement or compete with lower precision techniques?
4. Do the reported accuracy results account for additional fine-tuning iterations? If so, how many iterations were used, and how does this impact the practical runtime of the pruning process?
By addressing these points, the paper could significantly enhance its contribution and clarity, making it a strong candidate for future acceptance.
