Review of the Paper
The paper proposes a hierarchical transfer learning framework for sequence tagging, aimed at improving low-resource tasks by sharing multiple levels of representation between source and target tasks. The framework is generalizable to various neural architectures and demonstrates competitive performance across multiple benchmark datasets. The authors explore three transfer learning settings—cross-domain, cross-application, and cross-lingual—and present experimental results that show significant improvements, particularly under low-resource conditions. The paper also achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach.
Decision: Accept
The paper addresses an important problem in natural language processing (NLP)—transfer learning for sequence tagging in low-resource settings—and provides a well-motivated and methodologically sound solution. The hierarchical transfer learning framework is novel, generalizable, and empirically validated across diverse datasets and tasks. The results are compelling, particularly the consistent improvements under low-resource conditions and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. These contributions make the paper a valuable addition to the field.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance and Novelty: The paper tackles the critical challenge of improving low-resource sequence tagging tasks, a problem with significant implications for NLP applications in underrepresented domains and languages. The focus on hierarchical representation sharing is novel and well-motivated.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across multiple datasets, tasks, and transfer settings. The analysis of parameter-sharing schemes (T-A, T-B, T-C) is insightful and supports the claim that sharing more levels of representation improves performance.
3. Generalizability: The framework is adaptable to various neural architectures, making it broadly applicable. This generality enhances the impact and usability of the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Source and Target Task Definitions: The terms "source" and "target" tasks are used interchangeably in some parts of the paper, which could confuse readers. Clear and consistent definitions would improve the paper's readability.
2. Training Procedure Details: Section 3.3 lacks sufficient detail about the training procedure, particularly the task sampling strategy and hyperparameter tuning. Providing more specifics would enhance reproducibility.
3. Impact on High-Resource Tasks: It remains unclear whether the proposed framework benefits both tasks in a pair or primarily the low-resource task, potentially at the expense of the high-resource task. Addressing this trade-off empirically would strengthen the paper.
4. Random Task Pairing Analysis: The paper would benefit from an analysis of how often the framework improves low-resource tasks when task pairs are randomly selected. This would provide additional insights into the robustness of the approach.
5. Empirical Validation of Assumptions: The assumption that "sharing more levels of representation helps more" could be tested further with cross-domain task pairs to validate its generality.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the framework handle cases where the source and target tasks are only loosely related? Does the performance gain diminish significantly in such scenarios?
2. Can the proposed framework be extended to tasks with disparate alphabets (e.g., English and Chinese)? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. How does the framework balance the trade-off between improving the low-resource task and potentially degrading the performance of the high-resource task?
Overall, the paper is a solid and promising contribution to the field of NLP and transfer learning. Addressing the above suggestions and questions would further strengthen the work.
