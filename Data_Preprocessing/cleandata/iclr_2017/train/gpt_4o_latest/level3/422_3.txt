Review of the Paper: Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF)
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel method for unsupervised learning of latent Markovian state-space models. The authors leverage Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) to enable inference in highly non-linear dynamical systems, such as image sequences, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. The paper's key contributions include enforcing state-space model assumptions for reliable system identification, enabling long-term predictions, and scaling to large datasets through stochastic optimization. The proposed method is validated on dynamic systems like a pendulum and bouncing balls, demonstrating its ability to recover meaningful latent states and perform stable generative sampling.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is well-motivated and demonstrates novelty in its approach, several critical issues undermine its overall impact. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of convincing experimental results in key areas and incomplete comparisons with relevant prior work.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Strengths:
   - The paper is well-motivated, with clear assumptions about Markovian latent space and conditional independence. These assumptions are appropriate for extracting meaningful latent variables.
   - The use of SGVB in a sequential setting with state-space constraints inspired by Linear Gaussian Models is novel and well-articulated.
   - The bouncing ball experiment demonstrates an interesting alignment between latent space and physical system dynamics, particularly the checkerboard visualization.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Unconvincing Regression Results: The regression results in Figure 3, particularly for angular velocity extraction, are weak. While the method captures angle information effectively, the inability to extract velocity information undermines the claim of full-information latent state recovery.
   - Missing Comparisons: The absence of comparisons with Watter et al. (2015) is a significant oversight. Given that this prior work is directly relevant, its exclusion weakens the paper's positioning in the literature.
   - Unclear Design Choices: The rationale for combining coordinates in a 3x3 checkerboard pattern (Figure 5a) is not explained, leaving the reader uncertain about the motivation and implications of this design.
   - Deterministic Nature of Experiments: The bouncing ball experiment lacks predictive power due to its deterministic setup. This limits the generalizability of the results to more complex, stochastic systems.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Experimental Rigor:
   - Strengthen the regression results, particularly for velocity extraction, to better support the claim of meaningful latent variable recovery.
   - Include comparisons with Watter et al. (2015) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.
2. Clarity and Justification:
   - Provide a clear explanation for the 3x3 checkerboard pattern in Figure 5a. Why was this specific visualization chosen, and what does it reveal about the latent space?
   - Discuss the limitations of the deterministic bouncing ball experiment and consider including experiments with stochastic dynamics to demonstrate broader applicability.
3. Broader Context:
   - Address the trade-offs between reconstruction and prediction in greater detail. How does DVBF balance these competing objectives compared to prior methods?
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare quantitatively to Watter et al. (2015) in terms of long-term prediction and latent state recovery?
2. Can you provide additional insights into why the regression results for velocity extraction are poor? Is this due to the model architecture, training data, or some other factor?
3. What is the significance of the 3x3 checkerboard pattern in the bouncing ball experiment? How does it relate to the underlying system dynamics?
In conclusion, while the paper presents a novel and promising approach, the issues outlined above need to be addressed to strengthen its contributions and impact.
