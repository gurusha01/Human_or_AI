Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes an extension to Chalupka et al. (2016) by introducing a causal regularizer that incorporates sparsity assumptions via regularization. The authors aim to guide predictive models, particularly neural networks, toward causally interpretable solutions. The proposed method is applied to electronic health records (EHR) datasets, including Sutter Health's heart failure study and the MIMIC III dataset, to identify causal factors for heart failure and mortality outcomes. The authors claim that their causally regularized models outperform L1-regularized counterparts in both predictive and causal relevance. Additionally, the paper explores the use of causal regularization in generating multivariate causal hypotheses, achieving up to a 20% improvement in the causality score of generated hypotheses.
Decision: Reject
Key reasons for rejection are the lack of technical novelty and insufficient empirical evidence to support the central claims of causality learning.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Technical Novelty: The primary contribution of the paper is the addition of a regularization objective to the existing framework of Chalupka et al. (2016). While the idea of causal regularization is interesting, it is not sufficiently novel to warrant acceptance. The paper heavily relies on prior work and does not introduce a fundamentally new approach to causality detection or inference.
   
2. Weak Empirical Evidence: The experiments fail to convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns causality. The evaluation relies on expert judgment for ground truth, which, while valuable, is subjective and insufficient to validate the claims rigorously. The lack of robust causal validation metrics further undermines the empirical contributions.
3. Presentation Issues: The paper assumes familiarity with Chalupka et al. (2016) and is not self-contained, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the prior work to follow. Additionally, the organization of the paper is haphazard, with key methodological details and results scattered, leading to an unclear narrative.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Presentation: The paper should be restructured to provide a clear and logical flow. A standalone explanation of the Chalupka et al. (2016) framework and how the proposed regularizer extends it would improve accessibility. Additionally, the focus on healthcare datasets should be consistent throughout the paper.
2. Strengthen Empirical Validation: The authors should include more robust experiments to validate causality learning. For example, synthetic datasets with known causal structures could be used to quantitatively assess the method's ability to recover true causal relationships. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art causal inference methods would also strengthen the claims.
3. Enhance Technical Contributions: To improve the paper's novelty, the authors could explore more sophisticated regularization techniques or theoretical insights into the properties of the proposed causal regularizer. Additionally, addressing limitations of the current approach, such as sensitivity to noise or scalability to larger datasets, would add value.
4. Provide Detailed Methodological Insights: The paper should include more detailed explanations of the causal regularizer's design and its integration with neural networks. For instance, the rationale behind specific choices (e.g., hyperparameters, synthetic data generation) should be elaborated.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed causal regularizer compare to other causal inference methods, such as those based on structural equation modeling or causal discovery algorithms?
2. Can the authors provide quantitative evidence that the method identifies causal relationships rather than spurious correlations, particularly in real-world datasets?
3. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of regularization parameters? Can the authors provide guidelines for selecting these parameters in practice?
While the paper demonstrates a sincere effort to address an important problem in healthcare, it falls short in terms of novelty, rigor, and clarity. Addressing these issues could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
