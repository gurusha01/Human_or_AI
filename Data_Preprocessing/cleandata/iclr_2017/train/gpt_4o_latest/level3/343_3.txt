Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel statistical approach to character-level language modeling that is applicable to both programming languages and natural languages. The proposed model leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) to synthesize probabilistic models, enabling the representation of complex data dependencies. The method combines program synthesis via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with count-based estimation, offering advantages such as fast query times, human interpretability, and the ability to dynamically update training data. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms LSTM and n-gram models on structured programming datasets (e.g., Linux Kernel) and achieves competitive results on unstructured natural language datasets (e.g., Wikipedia). Additionally, the model's query times are faster than LSTM and comparable to n-gram models, making it a practical alternative for certain applications.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel approach, strong empirical results on programming datasets, and potential to inspire diverse research directions. However, improvements in clarity and completeness of algorithmic details are necessary.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper presents a unique non-neural approach to language modeling, which is particularly well-suited for structured data like programming languages. This is a refreshing departure from the dominant neural network-based methods and highlights the potential of program synthesis in machine learning.
2. Empirical Results: The model demonstrates superior performance compared to LSTM and n-gram models on programming datasets, with significant improvements in both bits-per-character (BPC) and error rates. While the results on natural language datasets are less impressive, the model remains competitive, showcasing its versatility.
3. Efficiency: The proposed method achieves faster query times than LSTM models and is comparable to n-gram models, making it a practical choice for real-time applications. The interpretability and modularity of the DSL-based approach further enhance its usability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Algorithmic Details: The paper lacks sufficient detail on key aspects of the synthesis process, such as the exact implementation of MCMC and decision tree learning. Including these details would improve reproducibility and clarity.
2. Wikipedia Results Table: The authors should include n-gram results in the Wikipedia results table for a more comprehensive comparison.
3. Discussion on Limitations: While the paper acknowledges that the DSL's restricted expressiveness may limit its applicability to unstructured data, a more detailed discussion on this trade-off would strengthen the paper.
4. Broader Context: The paper could better situate its contributions within the broader literature by discussing potential synergies with neural models, such as using the DSL model as a preprocessor or feature extractor for neural networks.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the choice of DSL instructions and their expressiveness impact the model's generalization to unstructured datasets like Wikipedia? Could extending the DSL improve performance in such cases?
2. What specific challenges were encountered during the synthesis of SwitchPrograms, and how were they addressed?
3. Could the authors provide more details on the computational resources required for training the DSL model, particularly in comparison to neural models on GPUs?
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by proposing a novel, interpretable, and efficient approach to language modeling. With some refinements, it has the potential to inspire further research at the intersection of program synthesis and machine learning.
