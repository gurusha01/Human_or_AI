Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper addresses the critical challenge of high-dimensional data (d >> n) in deep learning, particularly in genomic datasets where the number of features (SNPs) vastly exceeds the number of samples. The authors propose "Diet Networks," a novel reparametrization approach that significantly reduces the number of free parameters in neural networks by using feature embeddings and a parameter prediction network. This multi-task learning framework treats each feature as a task, enabling the model to generalize better and mitigate overfitting. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this method on the 1000 Genomes dataset for ancestry prediction, achieving competitive results while drastically reducing the parameter count. The work is well-written, with clear motivation, rigorous experiments, and a strong connection to prior literature.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted because it tackles a significant problem in deep learning with high-dimensional data, proposes a novel and feasible solution, and provides empirical evidence that supports its claims. The method is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates improvements over reasonable baselines.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Significance: The issue of high-dimensional data is a well-known bottleneck in applying deep learning to genomics and other domains. The proposed method directly addresses this challenge, making it highly relevant to the field.
2. Novelty and Feasibility: The idea of using a parameter prediction network to reduce the parameter count is innovative and practical. The multi-task learning perspective for features is a fresh and compelling approach.
3. Empirical Validation: The experiments on the 1000 Genomes dataset are thorough, with results showing reduced misclassification error and robustness compared to baselines like PCA and standard neural networks. The use of pre-computed feature embeddings further highlights the flexibility of the approach.
4. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-structured and provides sufficient background, detailed methodology, and clear explanations of results.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability Discussion: While the method is effective for the 1000 Genomes dataset, the scalability to even larger datasets with millions of features and samples could be discussed in more detail. How would the computational cost of the auxiliary network scale with increasing feature dimensions?
2. Comparison with Advanced Baselines: The paper compares Diet Networks with PCA and standard neural networks but does not benchmark against other state-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional data, such as sparse neural networks or feature selection techniques.
3. Feature Embedding Selection: The choice of feature embeddings (e.g., SNP2Vec, histograms) is critical to the method's success. A deeper exploration of how these embeddings impact performance and their computational trade-offs would strengthen the paper.
4. Biological Interpretability: Since the method is applied to genomic data, it would be valuable to discuss how the learned embeddings or parameter prediction network could provide insights into biological relationships between SNPs.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method handle datasets with missing or noisy SNP data? Would the parameter prediction network still be effective in such cases?
2. Can the Diet Networks framework be extended to other high-dimensional domains beyond genomics, such as image or text data? If so, what modifications would be required?
3. Did the authors explore the interpretability of the learned feature embeddings? For example, do similar SNPs cluster together in the embedding space, and does this align with known biological relationships?
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field by addressing a critical challenge in high-dimensional data analysis with a novel and effective approach. With minor improvements and additional clarifications, it has the potential to make a significant impact in both machine learning and genomics.
