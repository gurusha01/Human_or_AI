Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel perspective on understanding Residual Networks (ResNets) and Highway Networks, framing their skip-connected blocks as iterative refiners of the same feature rather than generators of new representations. This "unrolled iterative estimation" view challenges the traditional representation-based understanding of deep networks, offering insights into the advantages and disadvantages of these architectures. The authors provide theoretical derivations to unify ResNets and Highway Networks under this framework, explaining phenomena such as resilience to lesioning, layer reshuffling, and dropout. They also present preliminary experiments comparing ResNets and Highway Networks, refuting prior claims about the inefficiency of Highway Networks and highlighting the role of gating in feature refinement. The paper provides a promising theoretical foundation and raises important questions for further exploration.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting theoretical perspective and offers valuable insights, the decision to reject is based on the following key reasons:
1. Insufficient Experimental Validation: The empirical evidence supporting the "unrolled iterative estimation" assumption is limited. For example, the inconsistency observed in Stage 4 of Figure 3 undermines the generality of the proposed framework. Additional experiments, particularly beyond comparisons between ResNets and Highway Networks, are necessary to validate the iterative estimation hypothesis.
2. Preliminary Nature of Results: While the theoretical contributions are compelling, the experimental results are insufficiently robust to substantiate the claims. The paper does not explore the implications of its framework across diverse tasks or architectures, limiting its practical impact.
Supporting Arguments
1. The paper's theoretical contributions are well-motivated and address contradictions in the traditional representation view, such as the resilience of ResNets to lesioning and layer reshuffling. The derivations linking ResNets and Highway Networks under the iterative estimation framework are rigorous and insightful.
2. However, the experimental results are limited in scope. For instance, the analysis of estimation error (Figure 3) is not conclusive, as Stage 4 deviates from the expected behavior. This raises questions about the universality of the proposed framework.
3. The comparative experiments between ResNets and Highway Networks are informative but insufficient to establish the broader applicability of the iterative estimation view. The experiments focus primarily on image classification and language modeling, leaving other domains unexplored.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Validation: Conduct additional experiments to validate the iterative estimation hypothesis across diverse architectures and tasks. For example, testing the framework on transformer-based models or other modern architectures could strengthen the paper's claims.
2. Address Stage 4 Inconsistencies: Provide a detailed analysis of why Stage 4 in Figure 3 does not align with the proposed framework. This could involve exploring architectural modifications or alternative explanations for the observed behavior.
3. Broaden Comparative Analysis: Compare the iterative estimation framework with other theoretical perspectives, such as optimization-based views, to highlight its unique contributions and limitations.
4. Clarify Practical Implications: While the theoretical insights are valuable, the paper could benefit from a clearer discussion of how the proposed framework can guide the design of new architectures or improve existing ones.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide additional experiments to validate the iterative estimation hypothesis, particularly in architectures beyond ResNets and Highway Networks?
2. How do you explain the inconsistency in Stage 4 of Figure 3? Could this indicate a limitation of the proposed framework?
3. Have you considered testing the framework on tasks beyond image classification and language modeling? If so, what were the results?
4. How does the iterative estimation perspective compare to optimization-based views of ResNets and Highway Networks? Are there scenarios where one perspective is more applicable than the other?
In conclusion, while the paper offers a compelling theoretical perspective, additional experimental validation and broader exploration are necessary to establish its contributions fully.
