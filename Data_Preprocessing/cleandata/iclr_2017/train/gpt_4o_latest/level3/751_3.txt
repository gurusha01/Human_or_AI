The paper tackles the critical and timely issue of safety in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), proposing a novel approach called "intrinsic fear" to mitigate catastrophic failures. The authors highlight the limitations of deep Q-networks (DQNs) in avoiding catastrophic states due to distributional shift and catastrophic forgetting, introducing a supervised danger model to penalize the Q-learning objective and guide the agent away from dangerous states. The concept of \( D_d \) (rare but dangerous states) is particularly promising, as it aligns with the unique challenges of reinforcement learning compared to supervised learning. The paper demonstrates the method's effectiveness on toy environments like Adventure Seeker and Cart-Pole, as well as preliminary results on the Atari game Seaquest.
Decision: Reject  
While the paper addresses an important problem and introduces a creative solution, it suffers from significant flaws that undermine its scientific rigor and clarity. Specifically, the lack of sufficient context on prior work, an ill-defined problem setup, and the ad-hoc nature of the proposed solution raise concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the results.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Insufficient Context on Prior Work: The paper does not adequately situate itself within the broader literature on robust reinforcement learning, particularly omitting key contributions such as Shie Mannor's work. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and relevance of the proposed approach.
   
2. Ill-Defined Problem Setup: The definition of "catastrophic" actions is post-hoc and lacks clarity, making it challenging to evaluate the validity of the experiments. Additionally, the mismatch between training and evaluation metrics further complicates the interpretation of results.
3. Ad-Hoc Solution Design: The intrinsic fear model introduces new hyperparameters, additional networks, and replay memories without sufficient justification or ablation studies. This raises questions about the robustness and reproducibility of the results. For instance, the reported DQN performance on Cart-Pole appears inconsistent with established benchmarks.
4. Unaddressed Reviewer Feedback: The authors did not incorporate expected SARSA results, despite prior feedback, which would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Literature Review: Expand the discussion of related work, particularly in robust RL and safe exploration, to better contextualize the contribution.
   
2. Problem Definition: Provide a more rigorous and generalizable definition of catastrophic states and clarify how they are identified during training and evaluation.
3. Ablation Studies: Conduct experiments to isolate the contributions of individual components (e.g., fear radius, fear factor) and demonstrate the robustness of the approach across different hyperparameter settings.
4. Evaluation Metrics: Align training and evaluation metrics to ensure consistency and provide a more transparent comparison with baseline methods.
5. Bibliography: Address the sloppy citations (e.g., replacing arXiv references with peer-reviewed publications) to improve the paper's professionalism.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method compare to other robust RL techniques, such as those based on risk-sensitive objectives or constrained optimization?
2. Can the authors provide theoretical guarantees or empirical evidence that the intrinsic fear model does not overly penalize optimal policies in complex environments?
3. How sensitive is the approach to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the fear radius and fear factor? Would the method generalize to environments with higher-dimensional state spaces?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting idea with potential applications in safe RL, the current version lacks the rigor and clarity necessary for acceptance. Addressing the outlined issues could significantly strengthen the contribution.
