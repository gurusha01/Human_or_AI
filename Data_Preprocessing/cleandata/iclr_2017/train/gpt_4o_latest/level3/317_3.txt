Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces an innovative approach to image super-resolution (SR) by leveraging amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference with neural networks. The proposed method ensures that the high-resolution (HR) outputs are consistent with the low-resolution (LR) inputs by projecting onto an affine subspace of valid SR solutions. The authors present three optimization techniques to solve this problem: (1) Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), (2) denoiser-guided SR, and (3) density-guided SR. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with the GAN-based approach (AffGAN) yielding the most visually appealing results. Additionally, the work establishes a theoretical connection between GANs and variational inference, which is a novel contribution to the field. 
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces a promising method and demonstrates its effectiveness, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons: (1) the lack of clarity in the writing and presentation, which makes it difficult to fully comprehend the contributions and methodology, and (2) insufficient analysis of the learned network features, which limits the interpretability and understanding of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper tackles a highly technical and complex topic, but the writing is dense and often unclear. Key concepts, such as the affine projection mechanism and its integration into the neural network architecture, are not explained intuitively. The mathematical derivations, while thorough, are not accompanied by sufficient high-level explanations or visual aids to guide the reader through the methodology. This lack of clarity significantly hampers accessibility, even for an expert audience.
2. Analysis of Learned Features: While the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the paper does not provide sufficient analysis of the learned features or the behavior of the network. For instance, understanding how the affine projection influences the feature representations or why AffGAN outperforms other methods would strengthen the paper's contributions. Without this analysis, the results, though promising, lack interpretability and broader applicability.
3. Empirical Validation: The results are demonstrated across multiple datasets, and the GAN-based approach shows strong performance. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art SR methods beyond MSE and MAE-based baselines. This limits the ability to contextualize the contributions within the broader SR literature.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Improve Writing and Clarity: Simplify and streamline the presentation of the methodology. Use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the affine projection mechanism and its integration into the network. Provide more intuitive explanations alongside the mathematical derivations.
2. Feature Analysis: Include an in-depth analysis of the learned features, such as visualizing intermediate representations or conducting ablation studies to understand the role of the affine projection layer. This would provide insights into why the proposed methods work and how they can be improved.
3. Broader Comparisons: Compare the proposed methods with more state-of-the-art SR techniques, such as perceptual loss-based methods or other GAN-based SR approaches. This would contextualize the contributions and highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.
4. Stability of GAN Training: While the paper introduces instance noise to stabilize GAN training, more details on its impact and comparison with other stabilization techniques would be valuable.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the affine projection layer influence the feature representations learned by the network? Can you provide visualizations or insights into this?
2. Why does the AffGAN approach outperform the denoiser-guided and density-guided methods? Are there specific scenarios where the latter methods might be preferable?
3. How does the proposed method compare to state-of-the-art SR techniques, such as SRGAN or ESRGAN, in terms of perceptual quality and computational efficiency?
4. Can the proposed affine projection mechanism be generalized to other inverse problems beyond SR? If so, have you explored its applicability?
In conclusion, while the paper introduces a novel and promising approach to SR, significant improvements in clarity, analysis, and contextualization are needed to make it a strong contribution to the field.
