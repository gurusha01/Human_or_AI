Review of the Paper
The paper proposes a novel framework for joint motion prediction and activity classification, with applications to fruit fly behavior and online handwriting recognition. It employs a classical encoder-decoder pipeline with skip connections, leveraging semi-supervised learning by combining classification and motion prediction losses. The authors claim that motion prediction serves as a useful auxiliary task for improving action classification, particularly when labeled data is scarce. Additionally, the paper explores the generative capabilities of the model for simulating realistic motion trajectories and highlights its potential for discovering high-level behavioral phenomena.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces an interesting framework and demonstrates its application to two distinct domains, the decision to reject is based on two key reasons: (1) insufficient quantitative evaluation, and (2) unclear or incomplete results for the handwriting application. These issues undermine the scientific rigor and generalizability of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments
1. Insufficient Quantitative Results: The experimental evaluation is heavily qualitative, with limited quantitative metrics provided. For example, while motion prediction is claimed to improve action classification, the performance gain on motion prediction itself appears small and potentially insignificant compared to the baseline. Furthermore, the lack of quantitative results for the handwriting recognition task raises concerns about the robustness and applicability of the method to this domain.
2. Unclear Presentation: Figure 5a is unclear and introduces the term "BesNet" without prior explanation, which could confuse readers. Additionally, Figure 4 attempts to convey multiple narratives and should be split into separate figures for clarity. These presentation issues detract from the overall readability and impact of the paper.
3. Evaluation Concerns: The handwriting application lacks recognition results, making it difficult to assess the method's effectiveness in this domain. This omission weakens the claim of general applicability across different types of motion data.
Additional Feedback for Improvement
- The statement "Animal behavior is nondeterministic" is overstated and should be rephrased to reflect the lack of access to cognitive processes rather than asserting nondeterminism as a fact.
- The authors should consider whether a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) might be a more natural fit for modeling the non-deterministic behavior of agents, as GANs are well-suited for generating diverse and realistic outputs.
- The experimental section would benefit from more rigorous quantitative analysis, including statistical significance tests to validate performance improvements.
- The authors should provide a clearer explanation of the term "BesNet" and ensure that all figures are self-contained and easy to interpret.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide quantitative results for the handwriting recognition task to support your claims of generalizability?
2. How significant is the performance improvement in motion prediction compared to the baseline? Have you conducted statistical tests to validate this improvement?
3. Why was the use of GANs not considered for modeling non-deterministic behavior? Would this approach address some of the limitations of your current framework?
In summary, while the paper introduces a promising framework with interesting ideas, the lack of rigorous evaluation and clarity in presentation limits its impact. Addressing these issues in future work could significantly strengthen the contribution.
