Review of the Paper
Summary:  
This paper addresses the fundamental question of why deep neural networks are preferred over shallow networks by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis of their approximation capabilities. Specifically, the authors derive constructive proofs for ε-error upper bounds on neural networks with logarithmic depth and ReLU units, demonstrating that deep networks require exponentially fewer neurons than shallow networks for approximating a large class of piecewise smooth functions. The results are extended to broader function classes, including smooth and vector-valued functions, and tight lower bounds on network size are established for shallow architectures. The paper is well-written, technically sound, and integrates existing proof techniques to achieve sharp results. The contributions are significant, as they provide a deeper understanding of the advantages of depth in neural networks.
Decision: Accept  
The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution to the field of deep learning by rigorously analyzing the trade-offs between depth and size in neural networks. The results are novel, generalizable, and well-supported by clear proofs. The extension to multivariate and vector-valued functions further broadens the impact of the work. The clarity of writing and logical coherence make the paper accessible to a wide audience in the AI community.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Problem Tackled: The paper addresses a critical and timely problem in machine learning—understanding the efficiency of deep networks compared to shallow ones in function approximation. This question is both theoretically important and practically relevant, given the widespread use of deep learning in various applications.  
2. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-motivated and builds on a solid foundation of prior work, including results by Telgarsky (2016) and Eldan & Shamir (2015). It extends these results by providing tight bounds for a broader class of functions and by offering constructive proofs, which make the results more interpretable and applicable.  
3. Scientific Rigor: The claims made in the paper are supported by detailed and mathematically rigorous proofs. The results are not only correct but also sharp, as evidenced by the tightness of the bounds established for both deep and shallow networks. The inclusion of lower bounds further strengthens the theoretical contributions.
Suggestions for Improvement:  
1. Practical Implications: While the theoretical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a brief discussion on the practical implications of the findings. For instance, how might these results inform the design of neural network architectures in real-world applications?  
2. Empirical Validation: Although the focus is on theoretical analysis, a small empirical study illustrating the exponential growth in neurons required for shallow networks could make the results more tangible for practitioners.  
3. Comparison with Yarotsky (2016): The authors mention a similar paper by Yarotsky (2016) but do not provide a detailed comparison. A discussion highlighting the differences in approach and results would clarify the novelty of this work.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How do the results extend to neural networks with other activation functions, such as sigmoid or tanh?  
2. Can the theoretical findings be applied to neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent, or are they limited to idealized settings?  
3. Are there specific function classes where shallow networks might still be competitive, despite the exponential growth in size?  
Overall, this paper makes a significant theoretical contribution to the understanding of neural network depth and is a strong candidate for acceptance.
