Review
The paper presents an online structure learning algorithm for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) with Gaussian leaves, addressing the challenge of learning SPN structures from continuous data. The authors propose a novel method that begins with a fully factorized model and incrementally introduces structure by detecting correlations in the data. This approach improves upon the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by Jaini (2016), which constructs SPNs randomly while maintaining completeness and decomposability. The proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance, achieving better results on 5 out of 7 datasets compared to baseline methods such as randomly constructed SPNs, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBMs), and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GenMMNs). The manuscript is well-written, and the results suggest that the algorithm is effective and scalable for large datasets.
Decision: Reject
While the paper demonstrates promising empirical results and introduces a novel approach, the decision to reject is based on two primary concerns: (1) the lack of theoretical justification or insight into why the proposed algorithm works, and (2) significant overlap with Jaini's prior work, raising questions about the originality and depth of the contribution.
Supporting Arguments
1. Theoretical Justification: The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation or motivation for the proposed algorithm. While the empirical results are compelling, the absence of theoretical insights makes it difficult to generalize the findings or understand the underlying principles driving the algorithm's success.
2. Originality Concerns: Much of the manuscript builds on Jaini's work, and the overlap in methodology raises concerns about the novelty of the contribution. Although the authors extend Jaini's approach by introducing an online structure learning technique, the incremental nature of the improvement may not be sufficient for acceptance at a top-tier conference.
3. Reviewer Expertise: As a reviewer with limited expertise in SPNs and the datasets used, I am unable to fully assess the significance of the results. This limitation further contributes to the decision to reject, as I cannot confidently evaluate the broader impact of the work.
Additional Feedback
1. Hyperparameter Analysis: The paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the impact of hyperparameters (e.g., correlation threshold, maximum variables per leaf) on the SPN graph structure and performance. This could provide valuable insights into the robustness and adaptability of the algorithm.
2. Toy Task with Nonuniform Covariances: Testing the algorithm on toy datasets with nonuniform covariances could help validate its ability to detect complex correlations and provide a clearer demonstration of its capabilities.
3. Clarification of Novelty: The authors should explicitly clarify how their work differs from Jaini's and other prior methods. Highlighting the unique contributions and providing a more detailed comparison would strengthen the manuscript.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed algorithm handle cases where correlations between variables change dynamically over time? Does the structure adapt effectively in such scenarios?
2. Could the authors provide a theoretical explanation or intuition for why their method improves upon random SPN structures?
3. How sensitive is the algorithm to the choice of the correlation threshold? Would an adaptive threshold improve performance?
4. Can the proposed method be extended to handle discrete variables or mixed-variable datasets? If so, what challenges might arise?
While the paper demonstrates potential, addressing the concerns outlined above would significantly enhance its contribution and impact.
