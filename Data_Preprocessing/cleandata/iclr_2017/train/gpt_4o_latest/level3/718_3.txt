Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel framework for reinterpreting deep neural networks as multiagent systems, aiming to move away from the traditional layer-based, matrix-vector computation paradigm. The authors claim that their approach is more biologically plausible and scalable while maintaining equivalence with standard architectures like Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE). They also introduce a variant called Sparse Connect SDAE (SCSDAE), which reduces computational cost by randomly truncating connections. The paper provides theoretical proofs of equivalence between the proposed multiagent SDAE and the standard SDAE, as well as empirical validation using the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that SCSDAE achieves reduced computation time without significant degradation in performance.
Decision: Reject
The paper presents an interesting idea of generalizing neural architectures via multiagent systems, but it suffers from significant issues in clarity, technical rigor, and novelty. The lack of clarity in the exposition, combined with questionable claims and confusing implementation details, undermines its contributions.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Clarity and Presentation: The paper is difficult to follow due to unclear explanations and overly verbose descriptions. Key concepts, such as how the multiagent system fundamentally differs from existing architectures, are not well-articulated. The theoretical proofs are lengthy and convoluted, making it hard to verify their correctness.
2. Technical Concerns: 
   - The claim that the proposed layer-free architecture performs the same computation as a standard MLP appears circular. The authors essentially reimplement SDAE using a different framework but fail to demonstrate any significant advantage beyond equivalence.
   - Despite the stated goal of moving away from matrix-vector computations, the approach still relies on matrix-vector products at a low level, which contradicts the claimed novelty.
   - The asynchronous node communication is functionally equivalent to a "locking" computation, which is a well-known concept, further diminishing the novelty of the approach.
3. Empirical Results: While the experiments show equivalence between the multiagent SDAE and the standard SDAE, this is unsurprising given the theoretical claims. The results for Sparse Connect SDAE are intriguing but insufficiently explored. The authors do not provide a thorough analysis of why sparsity sometimes improves performance, leaving key insights unexplored.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity: The authors should streamline the presentation, focusing on the core contributions and clearly differentiating their approach from existing work. Simplifying the proofs and providing intuitive explanations would greatly improve readability.
2. Novelty and Motivation: The paper should better justify why the proposed framework is necessary and what unique advantages it offers. For example, demonstrating a clear biological or computational advantage over standard architectures would strengthen the motivation.
3. Technical Rigor: The authors need to address the apparent contradictions in their claims, such as the reliance on matrix-vector computations and the novelty of asynchronous communication. A more detailed comparison with related work, such as spiking neural networks or other biologically inspired models, is also necessary.
4. Empirical Analysis: The experiments should go beyond demonstrating equivalence and explore the practical benefits of the proposed framework. For instance, how does the multiagent system scale with larger datasets or more complex tasks? What are the trade-offs between sparsity and performance in SCSDAE?
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you clarify how the proposed multiagent framework fundamentally differs from existing biologically inspired models, such as spiking neural networks or asynchronous neural networks?
2. How does the use of matrix-vector computations align with the goal of moving away from layer-based architectures?
3. What specific advantages does the multiagent system provide in terms of scalability or biological plausibility, beyond what is achievable with standard architectures?
4. Can you provide more insights into why sparsity in SCSDAE sometimes improves performance? How does this relate to the underlying structure of the data or the optimization process?
While the paper introduces an intriguing concept, it requires significant revisions to address the issues of clarity, technical rigor, and novelty before it can be considered for acceptance.
