Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent features across layers, transitioning from low-level image properties to high-level semantic concepts. The authors propose a novel framework to quantify neuron selectivity using two indexes: a color selectivity index and a class selectivity index. These indexes enable ranking and clustering neurons based on their responses to specific properties. Additionally, the paper introduces the Neuron Feature (NF), a weighted average of images that maximally activate a neuron, as a visualization tool to better understand neuron activity. The study provides insights into the role of color in CNN representations, showing that color remains significant across all layers, and explores class selectivity, revealing that neurons in deeper layers become increasingly specialized. The authors also draw parallels between CNN feature representations and neural coding theories in human vision.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting framework and provides meaningful insights into CNN representations, it falls short in several areas. The novelty of the semantic analysis is limited, and the proposed NF measure, while sensible, does not generalize beyond the dataset used. These limitations hinder the broader applicability and impact of the work.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The paper effectively demonstrates the transition from low-level to high-level features in CNNs, corroborating existing literature.
   - The color analysis is a significant contribution, showing that color plays a critical role in CNN performance, even in deeper layers. The drop in performance on grayscale images underscores this point.
   - The proposed selectivity indexes are intuitive and provide a systematic way to analyze neuron behavior. The class selectivity index, in particular, offers a useful metric for understanding semantic specialization in CNNs.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The NF measure is limited to the dataset used for training and testing the network. It does not address the broader question of what functions the neurons compute, which restricts its generalizability.
   - The semantic analysis, while well-executed, offers limited new insights. The findings largely confirm known behaviors of CNNs (e.g., deeper layers are more class-selective), without providing groundbreaking revelations.
   - The discussion on localist versus distributed coding is speculative and lacks empirical evidence to substantiate the claims.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Generalization of NF: The authors should explore methods to generalize the NF measure beyond the specific dataset. For example, testing the framework on multiple datasets or incorporating synthetic data could strengthen the claims.
2. Broader Functionality of Selectivity Indexes: The paper could benefit from additional selectivity indexes, such as those for shape or texture, as mentioned in the conclusion. This would make the framework more comprehensive.
3. Empirical Validation of Speculations: The discussion on localist versus distributed coding is intriguing but requires empirical validation. The authors could design experiments to test these hypotheses directly.
4. Comparison with Existing Methods: The paper would be stronger with a more detailed comparison of the proposed framework against existing neuron visualization and interpretability techniques.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the NF measure perform on datasets other than ImageNet? Can it generalize to unseen data or networks trained on different tasks?
2. Have you considered extending the selectivity indexes to other properties, such as texture or shape? If so, what challenges do you foresee?
3. Can you provide empirical evidence to support the claims about localist versus distributed coding in CNNs?
In conclusion, while the paper makes meaningful progress in understanding CNN representations, its limitations in generalization and novelty prevent it from being a strong candidate for acceptance in its current form. Addressing the suggested improvements could significantly enhance its impact.
