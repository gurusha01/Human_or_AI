Review of "Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ)" Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel ternary weight quantization method, Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), which reduces the precision of neural network weights to ternary values while maintaining or even improving model accuracy. The method achieves a 16Ã— reduction in model size and demonstrates strong empirical performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The key innovation lies in the use of layer-specific, trainable scaling coefficients for positive and negative weights, enabling the model to learn both ternary values and assignments during training. The authors also highlight the potential for energy efficiency and inference acceleration, particularly on custom hardware. The results show that TTQ outperforms prior ternary methods (e.g., TWN) and even full-precision models in some cases, with improvements of up to 3% on ImageNet.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents an interesting and well-executed approach to weight quantization, achieving impressive results on benchmark datasets. While the novelty is somewhat incremental compared to prior work, the method is clearly articulated, and the empirical results convincingly support the claims. However, the paper would benefit from addressing several clarity and analysis issues, as outlined below.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The proposed method is well-motivated, addressing the critical trade-off between compression and performance for deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices.
   - The empirical results are robust and demonstrate clear improvements over both full-precision and prior ternary models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
   - The introduction of layer-specific learned scaling coefficients is a meaningful contribution, improving model capacity and preventing overfitting in deeper networks.
   - The paper provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm, making it reproducible.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The analysis of sparsity during training is interesting but lacks actionable insights. For example, while sparsity is shown to vary across layers, the implications for energy savings or hardware acceleration are not quantified.
   - The energy analysis assumes dense activations, which may not hold in practice. Providing average activation sparsity would strengthen the claims.
   - The role of quantized weights as "learning rate multipliers" during backpropagation is mentioned but not sufficiently explained or analyzed.
   - The novelty of the method is somewhat limited, as it builds on existing ternary quantization techniques (e.g., TWN) with incremental improvements.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity:
   - Provide more detailed captions for figures and tables to improve readability and self-containment.
   - Clarify how the threshold parameter \( t \) is set and whether results for multiple thresholds are included in the experiments. This would help assess the robustness of the method.
   - Address minor issues, such as the discrepancy in Table 3 (FLOPS vs. Energy), a figure reference error, and unclear phrasing in Section 5.
2. Analysis:
   - Include a quantitative analysis of activation sparsity to validate the energy efficiency assumptions.
   - Expand on the discussion of quantized weights acting as "learning rate multipliers" and their impact on training dynamics.
   - Provide a more detailed comparison with prior work, including TWN and DoReFa-Net, to better contextualize the contributions.
3. Future Directions:
   - Explore the potential for more aggressive pruning of redundant filters, as suggested by the kernel visualization analysis.
   - Investigate the scalability of TTQ to larger and more complex architectures, such as transformers or vision models.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of TTQ to the choice of the threshold parameter \( t \)? Did you explore adaptive or layer-specific thresholds?
2. Can you provide quantitative results on the energy savings achieved through sparsity in activations and weights?
3. How does TTQ perform on tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or natural language processing?
In conclusion, this paper presents a solid contribution to the field of model compression and quantization. While there are areas for improvement, the method's effectiveness and practical relevance make it a strong candidate for acceptance.
