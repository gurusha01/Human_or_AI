The paper proposes a novel approach for estimating maximum entropy (ME) distributions under expectation constraints by leveraging normalizing flow networks with invertible transformations. The authors reformulate the ME problem into a finite-dimensional optimization task, which is solved using stochastic optimization combined with the augmented Lagrangian method. The approach is validated on two problems: a toy Dirichlet distribution and a financial application involving option price data. The method demonstrates competitive performance, matching or outperforming Gibbs sampling while providing the added benefit of a closed-form density solution.
Decision: Accept (with revisions)  
Key reasons for this decision include the technical soundness of the method and its potential to impact fields requiring ME modeling. However, concerns about originality and the simplicity of the experimental validation warrant revisions to strengthen the paper.
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Technical Soundness: The use of normalizing flows to address the computational challenges of ME modeling is well-executed. The augmented Lagrangian method for handling constraints is a reasonable choice, though the paper does not explore whether this approach is novel in the context of stochastic objectives.  
2. Experimental Results: The method achieves comparable or superior results to Gibbs sampling, with the added advantage of closed-form density evaluation and efficient sampling. However, the experiments are limited to relatively simple problems, leaving open questions about scalability to high-dimensional or non-linear settings.  
3. Clarity and Writing: The paper is well-written and accessible, making it easy to follow the methodology and results. This clarity is a strength of the work.  
Additional Feedback for Improvement:  
1. Experimental Scope: The experiments should be expanded to include more complex, high-dimensional, or real-world problems to better demonstrate the method's robustness and scalability. For instance, testing on higher-dimensional Dirichlet distributions or more challenging financial datasets would strengthen the claims.  
2. Originality: While the combination of normalizing flows with the augmented Lagrangian method is interesting, the paper does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing work. A more thorough discussion of related literature and how this work advances the state of the art is needed.  
3. Practical Utility: The paper should provide a clearer discussion of the practical implications of the method, particularly in fields like finance or computer vision. How does this approach compare to existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and real-world applicability?  
4. Figures and Details: Additional clarification is needed for Figure 2, particularly regarding the choice of the Dirichlet distribution and its relevance to the broader claims of the paper.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does the proposed method scale with the dimensionality of the problem? Have you tested it on high-dimensional distributions beyond the Dirichlet example?  
2. Can you provide more details on the choice of the Dirichlet distribution and why it was selected as a validation problem?  
3. How does the method compare computationally to Gibbs sampling or other ME approaches in terms of runtime and resource usage?  
Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to ME modeling, but revisions are necessary to address concerns about originality, experimental scope, and practical utility.
