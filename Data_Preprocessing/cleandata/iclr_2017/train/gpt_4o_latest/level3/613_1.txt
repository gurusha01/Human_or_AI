Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel causal regularizer for neural networks, designed to balance causal interpretability and predictive performance in healthcare applications. By leveraging the "independence of mechanisms" (ICM) assumption, the authors introduce a causality score to weight a sparsity regularizer, enabling joint causal variable selection and prediction. The methodology is applied to electronic health records (EHR) datasets, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy and causal relevance compared to L1-regularized models. Additionally, the paper explores the use of the causal regularizer in multivariate causal hypothesis generation, reporting up to a 20% improvement in causality scores for generated hypotheses.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of broader experimental validation and limited technical novelty. While the paper addresses an important problem and demonstrates potential in healthcare applications, it falls short in providing sufficient theoretical and empirical evidence to establish the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Experimental Validation: The evaluation relies heavily on proprietary healthcare datasets, with no experiments on publicly available datasets beyond MIMIC III. This restricts the generalizability of the findings and makes it difficult for the community to reproduce or extend the results. The absence of controlled synthetic experiments further weakens the empirical validation.
   
2. Lack of Theoretical Contributions: The paper does not provide any formal theoretical guarantees, such as a theorem on identifiability or convergence properties of the proposed regularizer. This omission limits the scientific rigor and makes it challenging to assess the reliability of the method.
3. Limited Novelty: The methodology builds on prior work, such as Chalupka et al. (2016), with incremental modifications. While the integration of the causal regularizer with neural networks is interesting, it does not represent a significant technical advancement over existing approaches.
4. Absence of Ground Truth: The experiments rely on expert judgment as a proxy for causal ground truth, which introduces subjectivity. The lack of a clear ground truth undermines the claims of improved causal relevance.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Validation: Evaluate the proposed approach on additional publicly available datasets and include controlled synthetic experiments to demonstrate its robustness and generalizability. Synthetic experiments would also allow for the inclusion of a known ground truth, strengthening the empirical claims.
2. Theoretical Analysis: Provide formal theoretical results, such as guarantees on identifiability or conditions under which the proposed regularizer is optimal. This would add scientific rigor and make the contributions more compelling.
3. Reproducibility: Release the code and synthetic data generation process to enable reproducibility and facilitate further research by the community.
4. Comparison with Baselines: Include comparisons with a broader range of baseline methods, such as other causal inference techniques, to better contextualize the performance gains.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed regularizer perform in settings with known ground truth causal relationships? Can synthetic experiments be added to address this?
2. What are the theoretical properties of the causal regularizer? Are there specific conditions under which it is guaranteed to perform well?
3. How sensitive is the method to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the regularization parameter Î»?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses a relevant and challenging problem, it requires significant improvements in experimental validation, theoretical rigor, and reproducibility to meet the standards of acceptance at ICLR.
