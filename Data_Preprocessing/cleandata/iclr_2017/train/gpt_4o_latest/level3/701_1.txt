Review of "A Neuro-Modular Approach to Transfer Learning"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel modular approach to transfer learning, where pre-trained neural networks are augmented with additional untrained modules to learn task-specific representations. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, this method preserves the representational power of the original network while enabling the new modules to learn complementary features. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across multiple domains, including vision (CIFAR-10 to CIFAR-100, Stanford Cars) and NLP (IMDB sentiment classification), particularly in scenarios with limited training data. The proposed method reportedly outperforms standard fine-tuning, showcasing its potential as a valuable alternative for transfer learning tasks with small datasets.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting idea with potential, it falls short in critical areas of evaluation and practical feasibility. The following reasons underpin this decision:
1. Insufficient Validation of Claims: The reported performance gains may stem from the increased network capacity (doubling parameters) rather than the modular approach itself. The lack of key baselines, such as fine-tuning with learnable original weights or training the stitched network from scratch, undermines the scientific rigor of the results.
2. Practical Limitations: The method significantly increases computational cost (3x) and parameter count (2x), making it impractical for real-world applications where efficiency is critical. This issue is not adequately addressed in the paper.
Supporting Arguments
1. Baseline Comparisons: The absence of critical baselines, such as allowing the original network weights to be fine-tuned alongside the additional module, raises questions about whether the observed improvements are due to the proposed technique or simply the increased capacity. Similarly, training the stitched network from scratch on the source task before fine-tuning for the target task would help isolate the benefits of the modular approach.
   
2. Dataset Limitations: The omission of ImageNet, a standard benchmark for pre-trained networks, weakens the paper's claims of broad applicability in computer vision. The experiments on Stanford Cars, while interesting, primarily demonstrate ensembling rather than validating the modular approach.
3. Computational Overhead: The significant increase in parameters and computation undermines the practical utility of the method, especially in resource-constrained environments. The authors should explore strategies to reduce these overheads, such as more compact modules or pruning techniques.
4. Limited Analysis of Results: While the modular approach shows improvements on small data, the paper lacks a deeper analysis of why the modules learn complementary features and how this behavior generalizes across tasks and architectures.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Add Baselines: Include experiments that allow fine-tuning of the original network weights alongside the module and train the stitched network from scratch on the source task. These baselines are crucial to validate the claims.
2. Evaluate on ImageNet: Testing the method on ImageNet would strengthen its applicability and relevance to the broader community.
3. Address Efficiency: Explore ways to reduce computational and parameter overhead, such as using smaller modules or sparsity-inducing regularization.
4. Clarify Stanford Cars Results: Provide a more detailed analysis of how the modular approach contributes to performance gains beyond ensembling.
5. Expand Analysis: Include visualizations or ablations to better understand what the modules are learning and how they complement the pre-trained network.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you ensure that the observed performance gains are not solely due to the increased network capacity? Can you provide experiments isolating this factor?
2. Why was ImageNet excluded as a benchmark, and do you plan to evaluate the method on this dataset in future work?
3. Have you considered strategies to reduce the computational and parameter overhead of the proposed approach? If so, what were the results?
In conclusion, while the paper presents a promising idea, the lack of sufficient validation, practical limitations, and incomplete analysis prevent it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this time. Addressing these concerns in future iterations could significantly strengthen the work.
