The paper introduces a novel multi-view learning algorithm that aligns neighborhood relationships across views using linear projections. The authors frame the problem from an information retrieval perspective, which is a commendable and refreshing approach to multi-view learning. The method's flexibility in allowing projections with differing dimensions across views is a notable strength, as it accommodates diverse data structures. The proposed algorithm models neighborhood relationships better than Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), focusing on preserving local dependencies rather than maximizing global correlation. However, it does not directly optimize typical retrieval criteria like ranking, which could limit its applicability in certain information retrieval tasks.
Despite the innovative contributions, the paper has several limitations that hinder its acceptance. The high time complexity of the algorithm is a significant concern, as it restricts scalability and confines experiments to small datasets. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, they do not propose or implement any acceleration techniques to address it. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation lacks depth. The choice of linear mappings over nonlinear ones is not adequately justified, and the absence of experiments with nonlinear projections limits the method's demonstrated significance. Comparisons with nonlinear CCA or other state-of-the-art nonlinear methods are missing, which weakens the empirical validation of the proposed approach.
Additionally, the paper does not sufficiently situate itself within the broader literature. For instance, it lacks a discussion and comparison with relevant approaches, such as the contrastive loss framework introduced by Hermann and Blunsom (ICLR 2014). This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and relative advantages of the proposed method.
Decision: Reject
Key Reasons:
1. The high time complexity limits scalability, and no solutions are proposed to address this issue.
2. The experimental evaluation is incomplete, lacking justification for linear mappings and comparisons with nonlinear methods.
Supporting Arguments:
- The scalability issue is critical for real-world applications, where datasets are often large.
- Without experiments on nonlinear projections or comparisons with nonlinear CCA, the paper's claims about flexibility and superiority remain underexplored.
- The absence of discussion on related work like contrastive loss frameworks weakens the paper's positioning in the literature.
Additional Feedback:
1. Scalability: Consider implementing acceleration techniques, such as those used in neighbor embedding, to reduce the time complexity and enable experiments on larger datasets.
2. Nonlinear Projections: Extend the method to include nonlinear mappings and compare its performance with nonlinear CCA and other state-of-the-art methods.
3. Related Work: Include a detailed discussion of related approaches, particularly contrastive loss frameworks, and clarify how the proposed method differs or improves upon them.
4. Ranking Optimization: Explore ways to directly optimize retrieval criteria like ranking, which could enhance the method's applicability in information retrieval tasks.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Why was the choice of linear mappings prioritized over nonlinear ones, given the flexibility of the proposed framework?
2. How does the method compare to nonlinear CCA or other nonlinear multi-view learning approaches in terms of performance and computational cost?
3. Could the proposed algorithm be extended to optimize ranking-based retrieval criteria, and if so, how?
By addressing these concerns and expanding the scope of experiments, the paper could significantly strengthen its contributions and impact.
