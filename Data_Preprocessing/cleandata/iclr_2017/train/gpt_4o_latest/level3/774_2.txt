The paper introduces several techniques for sampling and visualizing the latent spaces of generative models, including spherical linear interpolation (slerp), J-diagrams, MINE grids, and novel methods for deriving attribute vectors. It aims to improve the interpretability and visual quality of generative models, with examples applied to both Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The paper's contributions are primarily in visualization design, offering tools to explore latent spaces and manipulate image attributes. While the techniques are visually compelling and demonstrate creative potential, the paper leans more toward artistic visualization than rigorous scientific contributions.
Decision: Reject.  
Key reasons:  
1. The paper lacks a single clear message or cohesive narrative, making it difficult to identify a central scientific contribution.  
2. The justification for spherical interpolation is flawed, relying on incorrect assumptions about GAN latent space distributions and lacking strong theoretical or empirical evidence.  
Supporting Arguments:  
The spherical interpolation idea, while intriguing, is based on an oversimplified understanding of high-dimensional latent space properties. The assumption that slerp prevents divergence from the model's prior is not rigorously validated, and the results suggesting its visual superiority are inconclusive. Furthermore, most contributions focus on visualization rather than advancing the underlying generative models or providing quantitative evaluations. The J-diagram and MINE grids are effective tools for exploring latent spaces, but their utility is limited to qualitative insights. The attribute vector section introduces novel methods for transforming images, but these techniques are not evaluated quantitatively, leaving their broader applicability unclear.
Additional Feedback:  
1. The paper would benefit from a clearer focus and a more cohesive narrative. What is the primary problem being addressed, and how do the proposed techniques advance the field?  
2. The justification for spherical interpolation should be revisited. The authors should provide stronger theoretical evidence or empirical results to validate its effectiveness.  
3. Quantitative evaluations are essential. For example, comparing the proposed techniques to existing methods using established metrics (e.g., FID, IS) would strengthen the paper's claims.  
4. The artistic and visualization-oriented contributions are valuable but should be framed as complementary to scientific advancements, not as substitutes.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. Can you provide quantitative evidence to support the claim that spherical interpolation produces sharper samples compared to linear interpolation?  
2. How does the proposed spherical interpolation perform across different types of generative models (e.g., GANs with non-Gaussian priors)?  
3. Have you considered alternative methods for addressing the "tent-pole" effect in linear interpolation, and how do they compare to slerp?  
4. Could you clarify how the attribute vector techniques generalize to domains outside of images?  
Overall, while the paper introduces creative and visually engaging techniques, it falls short in terms of scientific rigor and clarity. Addressing these issues could significantly improve its impact.
