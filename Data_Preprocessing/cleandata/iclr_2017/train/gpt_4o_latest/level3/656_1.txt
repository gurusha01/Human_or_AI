Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture that combines a scattering network with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve stability and performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The scattering network serves as a fixed, theoretically grounded initialization for the first layers, while the subsequent layers are learned in a supervised manner. The authors demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10, while offering stability to geometric transformations and noise. Additionally, the paper introduces ScatWave, a GPU-based implementation of scattering networks, and provides insights into the learned invariances of the hybrid architecture. The work addresses a gap in the scattering literature by adapting it for practical applications and highlights its potential for computational savings and robustness.
Decision: Accept with Minor Revisions
The paper makes a novel and well-motivated contribution by bridging scattering networks and CNNs, demonstrating their complementary strengths. However, there are areas where the work could be strengthened, particularly in terms of empirical validation and robustness analysis. These limitations do not detract significantly from the overall contribution, but addressing them would enhance the paper's impact.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Novelty and Motivation: The hybrid architecture is a unique contribution that fills a gap in the scattering literature by adapting it for practical, supervised learning tasks. The motivation is clear, and the approach is well-grounded in theory, leveraging the stability properties of scattering transforms.
2. Empirical Results: The experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10 demonstrate competitive performance, particularly in limited data settings. The results support the claim that scattering initialization improves generalization and stability.
3. Theoretical Insights: The paper provides valuable theoretical insights into the stability and invariance properties of the hybrid architecture, which are supported by both mathematical analysis and empirical observations.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Adversarial Robustness: While the paper emphasizes the stability of scattering layers, it does not explore their adversarial robustness. An analysis of how the hybrid architecture performs under adversarial attacks would provide valuable insights and strengthen the claims about stability.
2. Real-World Limited Data Problems: The experiments are limited to standard benchmarks. Testing the architecture on real-world limited data scenarios (e.g., medical imaging or remote sensing) would better validate its generalization capabilities.
3. Comparison with SOTA ResNet: The inclusion of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ResNet in Table 3, as suggested, would provide a more comprehensive comparison and contextualize the performance of the proposed architecture.
4. Minor Typos: The text contains minor typographical errors (e.g., "tacke," "developping," "learni") that should be corrected for clarity and professionalism.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the hybrid architecture perform under adversarial attacks compared to purely supervised CNNs? Can the scattering layers mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities?
2. Have you considered testing the architecture on real-world datasets with limited labeled data, such as medical imaging or satellite imagery? If not, what challenges do you foresee in applying the method to such domains?
3. Could you provide more details on the computational savings achieved by the scattering layers compared to fully learned CNNs? How significant are these savings in large-scale applications?
By addressing these points, the paper would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed architecture and its practical implications. Overall, the work is a valuable contribution to the field and merits acceptance.
