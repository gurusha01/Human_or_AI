Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the types of information captured in unsupervised sentence representation learning, focusing on low-level sentence properties such as length, word content, and word order. It introduces a novel methodology for analyzing sentence embeddings through auxiliary prediction tasks, providing a fine-grained lens to evaluate different sentence representation models. The study reveals several surprising findings, such as the ability of CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words) representations to probabilistically encode word order and sentence length, despite their lack of explicit sequence modeling. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that LSTM-based sentence autoencoders encode interpretable features even for randomly permuted sentences, suggesting robustness to natural language word order. These insights are valuable for advancing unsupervised sentence representation learning and have broader implications for other representation learning systems.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its novel contributions to understanding sentence embeddings and its rigorous empirical evaluation. However, certain claims and findings require clarification and further investigation, as outlined below.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Impact: The proposed methodology for analyzing sentence embeddings is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the literature. By focusing on low-level sentence properties, the paper provides actionable insights that can inform the design of future sentence representation models.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with a clear evaluation framework and extensive comparisons across models (CBOW, LSTM autoencoders, and skip-thought vectors). The use of auxiliary prediction tasks is a strength, offering a more nuanced understanding of the encoded information.
3. Surprising Findings: The discovery that CBOW representations encode non-trivial information about word order and length is both unexpected and thought-provoking, challenging assumptions about the limitations of bag-of-words models.
Areas for Improvement and Questions for the Authors
1. Unexplained Drop in CBOW Performance: The paper reports an unexplained and implausible drop in CBOW performance at higher dimensions, particularly for word-content prediction. This warrants further investigation. Is this due to overfitting, or are there other factors at play? Additional analysis, such as examining the embedding norms or distributional properties, would be helpful.
2. Misleading Claim: The statement that "LSTM autoencoders are more effective at encoding word order than word content" is misleading, as the two are not directly comparable. The authors should rephrase this claim to avoid confusion and provide a more balanced interpretation of the results.
3. Evaluation of Skip-Thought Vectors: While the inclusion of skip-thought vectors is insightful, the comparison is not entirely fair due to differences in training data and embedding sizes. A more controlled comparison would strengthen the findings.
4. Generality of Findings: The paper acknowledges the limitations of empirical work and the potential lack of generalizability to other datasets. Could the authors provide additional experiments on a different corpus to validate their findings?
5. BLEU Scores and Encoder Quality: The paper suggests that BLEU scores are sub-optimal for evaluating encoder quality. Could the authors propose alternative metrics or evaluation strategies that better align with the properties they aim to measure?
Questions for Clarification
1. How does the performance of the proposed methodology compare to traditional evaluation methods for sentence embeddings on downstream tasks? Could the authors provide a brief discussion on this?
2. The paper mentions that CBOW encodes word order probabilistically due to natural language regularities. Could the authors elaborate on how these regularities are quantified or modeled in the experiments?
3. For the LSTM autoencoder, how does the dimensionality trade-off between word content and word order encoding manifest in practical applications? Are there specific tasks where one property is more critical than the other?
Additional Feedback
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of its limitations, particularly regarding the focus on low-level properties and the lack of direct connection to downstream applications.
- The visualizations (e.g., accuracy vs. embedding size) are informative but could be supplemented with error bars or significance tests to provide a clearer picture of variability across runs.
- Future work could explore extending the methodology to higher-level semantic and syntactic properties, as acknowledged by the authors.
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of unsupervised sentence representation learning. While there are areas that require further clarification and refinement, the novelty and rigor of the work justify its acceptance.
