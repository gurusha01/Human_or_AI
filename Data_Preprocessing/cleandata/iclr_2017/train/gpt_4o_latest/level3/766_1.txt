Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a pedestrian detection method combining EdgeBoxes for region proposal generation and Fast R-CNN with batch normalization to improve training efficiency and generalization. The authors claim that their approach reduces training time, avoids gradient issues, and enhances detection performance. Experiments are conducted on the INRIA and ETH datasets, where the proposed method reportedly achieves competitive results compared to some state-of-the-art methods.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of novelty and limited significance of the contributions. The proposed method does not introduce substantial advancements over prior works and fails to surpass the state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the evaluation is restricted to two datasets, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The poor writing quality further detracts from the paper's clarity and impact.
Supporting Arguments
1. Lack of Novelty: The paper builds on existing techniques (EdgeBoxes and Fast R-CNN) with the addition of batch normalization, which is a well-established method. This combination does not represent a novel contribution, as similar ideas have been explored in prior works like S. Zhang et al. (CVPR 2016) and L. Zhang et al. (ECCV 2017). The paper fails to articulate how its approach significantly advances the field.
   
2. Limited Results: While the results on INRIA and ETH datasets are fair, they do not surpass the state-of-the-art methods such as SpatialPooling or TA-CNN. The performance gap is particularly evident on the ETH dataset. Moreover, the absence of evaluations on more diverse and challenging datasets like Caltech or KITTI undermines the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.
3. Writing Quality: The paper suffers from poor grammar, unclear sentences, and incorrect citation formatting. This significantly hampers readability and makes it difficult to follow the technical details. For instance, the introduction and related work sections are verbose and repetitive, while the experimental results lack sufficient depth in analysis.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Dataset Evaluation: To strengthen the experimental validation, the authors should include results on more diverse datasets such as Caltech or KITTI. This would provide a better understanding of the method's generalizability and robustness.
2. Novelty and Significance: The authors should clearly articulate the unique contributions of their work compared to prior approaches. A deeper exploration of innovative techniques, such as improved region proposal methods or novel architectural modifications, would enhance the paper's impact.
3. Writing and Presentation: The paper requires significant editing for grammar, clarity, and citation formatting. The authors should focus on concise and precise descriptions of their methodology and results. Figures and tables should be better annotated to improve interpretability.
4. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: The paper should include a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Highlighting specific scenarios where the proposed method excels would add value.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to recent advancements in pedestrian detection, such as those using transformer-based architectures or advanced feature fusion techniques?
2. Why were the Caltech and KITTI datasets excluded from the evaluation? Would the proposed method be scalable to more complex datasets with varying conditions?
3. Can the authors provide more detailed insights into the computational efficiency gains achieved by their approach compared to Fast R-CNN without batch normalization?
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an important problem in pedestrian detection, it falls short in terms of novelty, significance, and experimental rigor. Significant improvements are needed before the work can be considered for publication.
