Review
The paper proposes a novel framework for addressing inverse problems in computer vision by employing a weakly supervised inversion model. The authors introduce the concept of "adversarial imagination priors," which leverage unpaired data and memory retrieval to guide the generation of imaginations (e.g., albedo, shading, or in-painted images). The proposed approach is evaluated across three tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic image decomposition, and figure-ground layer extraction. The key contribution lies in replacing hand-designed priors with data-driven adversarial priors, which are trained without paired supervision. The authors also propose the use of fully convolutional discriminators and task-specific renderers to stabilize training and improve generalization.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons: (1) the experimental evaluation is insufficient to support the paper's claims, and (2) the lack of standard experimental validation makes it difficult to assess the scientific rigor and practical utility of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
1. Insufficient Experimental Validation: The experimental results lack quantitative benchmarks against strong baselines. For example, in the image in-painting task, the authors compare their method against variations of their own model rather than established baselines in the literature. Similarly, the intrinsic image decomposition results are not quantitatively compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, making it difficult to assess the performance gains.
2. Unclear Claims and Visual Results: The qualitative results presented in Figures 4, 5, and 7 are not convincing. For instance, the in-painting results do not clearly demonstrate significant improvement over simpler methods, and the intrinsic decomposition results are visually comparable to supervised baselines without clear evidence of generalization. Additionally, the behavior of the curves in Figure 6 is unclear and requires further explanation, particularly regarding the convergence behavior of fully convolutional discriminators.
3. Lack of Standard Validation: The paper does not follow standard experimental protocols, such as using widely accepted datasets or metrics for evaluation. This omission makes it challenging to assess the generalizability and applicability of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
1. Quantitative Evaluation: The authors should include quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods for all tasks. Metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, or task-specific benchmarks would provide a clearer picture of the model's performance.
2. Baselines: The paper would benefit from comparisons to existing GAN-based methods or other weakly supervised approaches, especially for tasks like image in-painting and intrinsic decomposition.
3. Clarity of Figures: The figures, particularly Figure 6, require better explanation. The behavior of the curves is not intuitive, and the authors should clarify why fully convolutional discriminators converge faster and how this impacts the final results.
4. Memory Retrieval: The memory retrieval mechanism is central to the proposed approach but is not well-justified or thoroughly analyzed. The authors should provide ablation studies to demonstrate its effectiveness and discuss its limitations.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were no quantitative comparisons made against state-of-the-art methods for the tasks considered? Could you provide such comparisons in a revised version of the paper?
2. The curves in Figure 6 show differences in convergence behavior. Could you clarify the underlying reasons for these differences and their implications for the model's performance?
3. How does the memory retrieval engine handle cases where the input image is significantly dissimilar to the memory database? Have you tested the robustness of the approach in such scenarios?
4. Could you elaborate on the scalability of the proposed method to more complex datasets or tasks, such as those involving high-resolution images or videos?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting concept of adversarial imagination priors, the lack of rigorous experimental validation and comparisons to existing methods significantly undermines its contributions. Addressing these issues would greatly improve the paper's impact and clarity.
