Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces an iterative framework for machine translation inspired by the human translation process, where translators refine rough drafts iteratively. The proposed approach leverages convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms to predict and apply word substitutions to improve an initial translation. The dual-attention model, which attends to both the source sentence and the guess translation, is particularly noteworthy. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves a modest but consistent improvement of up to 0.4 BLEU on the WMT15 German-English dataset, requiring fewer than one substitution per sentence on average. The paper also explores various refinement heuristics and oracle-based evaluations to assess the potential of the approach.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting idea and a novel iterative refinement framework, several key issues limit its impact and readiness for acceptance. The primary concerns include insufficient exploration of diverse machine translation systems, weak connections between error detection and refinement tasks, and the lack of architectural clarity. These issues hinder the generalizability and interpretability of the proposed method.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Limited Scope of Evaluation: The iterative framework is tested exclusively on phrase-based machine translation (PBMT). The authors acknowledge that the initial guess translation significantly influences the results, yet no experiments are conducted with other systems like neural machine translation (NMT) or simpler baselines. This raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the approach.
   
2. Weak Integration of Error Detection and Refinement: Although the paper includes a preliminary error detection model, its connection to the iterative refinement process is not well-articulated. Stronger integration and analysis of how error detection informs refinement decisions would enhance the coherence of the framework.
3. Clarity Issues: The paper lacks architectural diagrams, which would help clarify the relationships between the proposed models and their components. Additionally, minor grammatical errors and ambiguous variable usage (e.g., "replaceS" on p.2 and "j" on p.3) detract from the overall readability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Evaluation: Test the iterative framework on diverse translation systems, including NMT and simpler baselines, to demonstrate its generalizability. Additionally, evaluate the impact of different initial guess qualities on the refinement process.
2. Stronger Ground-Truth for Evaluation: Incorporate post-edited text as a more reliable ground-truth for assessing the quality of refinements. This would provide a more realistic benchmark for translation improvement.
3. Architectural Clarity: Include diagrams to visually represent the relationships between the error detection model, single-attention model, and dual-attention model. This would improve the interpretability of the proposed framework.
4. Error Detection Integration: Strengthen the link between error detection and iterative refinement. For example, demonstrate how error detection outputs influence refinement decisions or provide ablation studies to quantify their impact.
5. Address Minor Typos: Correct grammatical errors and clarify ambiguous variable usage to improve the paper's readability and professionalism.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was the framework not tested on neural machine translation (NMT) systems, given their prevalence in modern translation tasks?
2. How does the quality of the initial guess translation affect the performance of the iterative refinement process? Would a poor-quality guess result in diminishing returns?
3. Could the proposed framework be extended to handle insertions, deletions, or multi-word edits, as suggested in the conclusion? If so, what challenges might arise?
In summary, while the paper presents an innovative idea, addressing the above concerns is essential to strengthen its contributions and ensure its applicability across diverse translation systems.
