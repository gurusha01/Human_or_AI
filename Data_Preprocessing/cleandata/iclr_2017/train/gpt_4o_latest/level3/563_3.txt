Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Bregman divergences, termed b-GAN. The authors claim that this approach provides a unified perspective on GANs by leveraging density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. The paper highlights two primary contributions: (1) deriving a unified algorithm for GAN training based on density ratio estimation, and (2) preserving the original objective function derived from the minimax game, which is often modified in traditional GANs. The authors also present experimental results on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CelebA, exploring the stability of different divergences and heuristics.
Decision: Reject
The paper is not ready for publication due to significant issues in its exposition, complexity, and lack of clear evidence supporting its claims. Below are the key reasons for this decision:
1. Poor Exposition: The manuscript is difficult to follow due to its dense mathematical presentation and lack of clear motivation or intuition behind the proposed approach. The theoretical framework is scattered, and the connections to existing GAN literature are not well articulated. This makes it challenging to understand the novelty and significance of the contributions.
2. Excessive Complexity: The proposed b-GAN introduces multiple alternatives and heuristics, which add unnecessary complexity. The paper does not provide a principled simplification or clear guidelines on when and how to use these alternatives. This undermines the practical utility of the method.
3. Unclear Experimental Validation: The experimental results are hard to interpret and do not convincingly demonstrate the practical advantages of b-GAN over existing GAN variants. There is a lack of direct comparisons with other GAN approaches, such as f-GAN or WGAN, which makes it difficult to evaluate the proposed method's relative performance.
Supporting Arguments
- Motivation and Literature Placement: While the paper claims to provide a unified perspective on GANs, it does not adequately motivate why Bregman divergences are particularly advantageous over other divergences already explored in GAN literature. The paper also fails to position its contributions clearly within the broader context of GAN research, leaving the reader uncertain about its significance.
  
- Experimental Evidence: The experimental section lacks rigor. The results are presented without sufficient quantitative metrics or visual comparisons to other GANs. The claim that Pearson divergence improves stability is not substantiated with robust evidence. Additionally, the experiments do not convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method generates better or more stable results than existing GAN formulations.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Improve Clarity and Structure: The paper needs a clearer exposition of its contributions, with intuitive explanations and stronger connections to existing GAN literature. Simplify the mathematical presentation and provide more accessible insights for readers unfamiliar with density ratio estimation.
2. Reduce Complexity: The proposed algorithm should be streamlined, and the role of each heuristic should be clearly justified. Avoid introducing unnecessary alternatives unless they are rigorously motivated and experimentally validated.
3. Strengthen Experiments: Provide direct comparisons with state-of-the-art GANs (e.g., f-GAN, WGAN) using standard evaluation metrics like FID or IS. Include qualitative results (e.g., generated images) and quantitative analyses to demonstrate the practical benefits of b-GAN.
4. Address Open Questions: Clarify the following:
   - Why is Bregman divergence particularly suited for GAN training compared to other divergences?
   - How does the proposed method handle the trade-off between stability and complexity in practice?
   - Can the authors provide theoretical guarantees or bounds for the proposed algorithm's performance?
Questions for the Authors
1. How does b-GAN compare quantitatively to other GAN variants in terms of image quality and training stability?
2. What is the computational overhead introduced by the additional complexity of b-GAN, and how does it scale with larger datasets or models?
3. Can the authors provide a more intuitive explanation of why Pearson divergence is robust and why it improves stability in the context of GANs?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting perspective on GANs using Bregman divergences, it requires substantial improvements in clarity, experimental rigor, and practical justification before it can be considered for publication.
