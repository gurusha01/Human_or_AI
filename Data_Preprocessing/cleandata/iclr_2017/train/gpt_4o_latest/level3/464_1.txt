Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to learning tree-structured neural networks for sentence representation using reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that relies on predefined syntactic trees or explicit supervision from treebank annotations, this method optimizes tree structures based on downstream task performance. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across four natural language processing (NLP) tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, natural language inference, and sentence generation. The results show that the learned tree structures outperform both sequential and syntactic tree-based models in most cases. Additionally, the paper provides an insightful analysis of the induced tree structures, revealing that they capture some linguistically intuitive patterns, such as noun phrases and verb phrases, while deviating from conventional syntactic structures. Despite the computational inefficiency of RL, this work contributes to the exploration of task-specific hierarchical representations in NLP.
Decision: Accept
The paper should be accepted for discussion at the conference. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The use of RL to discover task-specific tree structures is a creative and timely contribution, addressing a significant challenge in combining RL and NLP.
2. Empirical Validation: The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines across multiple tasks, providing evidence of its potential.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-situated in the literature, bridging gaps between sequential models, syntactic tree-based models, and unsupervised grammar induction. The motivation to explore task-specific tree structures without relying on human annotations is compelling.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, covering diverse NLP tasks and comparing against strong baselines. The results consistently highlight the advantages of learning latent tree structures, particularly in sentiment analysis and semantic relatedness tasks.
3. Insightful Analysis: The qualitative analysis of the induced trees is a valuable addition, shedding light on the linguistic plausibility of the learned structures and their divergence from conventional syntax.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong overall, there are areas that could be improved:
1. Efficiency Concerns: The training time for the proposed models is a significant limitation, particularly for larger datasets. The authors should discuss potential strategies to mitigate this, such as batching or approximations for RL.
2. Clarity on Limitations: The paper acknowledges that the induced trees sometimes lack linguistic interpretability. A more detailed discussion on when and why this occurs would strengthen the analysis.
3. Comparison with State-of-the-Art: While the paper compares against relevant baselines, it would benefit from a more direct comparison with state-of-the-art models, particularly those using larger architectures or pre-trained embeddings.
4. Downstream Task Generalization: The paper could explore whether the learned tree structures generalize well across tasks or are highly task-specific. This would provide additional insights into the utility of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of the model to the choice of the reward function in RL? Did you experiment with alternative reward formulations?
2. Given the computational inefficiency of RL, have you considered hybrid approaches that combine supervised pretraining with RL fine-tuning?
3. How does the model perform when scaled to larger architectures, such as those using pre-trained embeddings like BERT or GPT? Would the learned tree structures still provide an advantage?
In conclusion, this paper presents an interesting and well-executed exploration of task-specific tree structures in NLP using RL. While it has limitations, particularly in terms of efficiency, the novelty and empirical results make it a valuable contribution to the field.
