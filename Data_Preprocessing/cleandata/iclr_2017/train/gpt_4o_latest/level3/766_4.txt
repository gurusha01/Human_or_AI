Review
Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a pedestrian detection method based on the Fast R-CNN framework, enhanced with batch normalization (BN) and the EdgeBoxes algorithm for region proposal generation. The authors aim to improve detection efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the robust feature extraction capabilities of Fast R-CNN and the computational efficiency of EdgeBoxes. The paper evaluates the approach on two benchmark datasets, INRIA and ETH, demonstrating competitive performance compared to existing methods. The authors highlight the benefits of batch normalization in reducing training time and improving generalization, as well as the advantages of EdgeBoxes in generating high-quality region proposals.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is well-written and easy to follow, the contributions are too incremental to warrant publication. The use of EdgeBoxes for region proposals and batch normalization in Fast R-CNN are not novel advancements, and the experimental scope is limited to two smaller datasets, INRIA and ETH, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the paper fails to adequately position itself within the existing literature by omitting citations to more recent and superior methods.
Supporting Arguments
1. Incremental Contributions: The primary contributions—using EdgeBoxes for region proposals and adding batch normalization to Fast R-CNN—are minor. Both techniques are well-established, and their application to pedestrian detection does not provide significant new insights.
2. Limited Experimental Scope: The evaluation is restricted to INRIA and ETH datasets, which are relatively small and less diverse compared to larger, more challenging datasets like Caltech and KITTI. This limits the broader applicability and impact of the proposed method.
3. Missing Literature Context: The paper does not cite or compare its results to more recent and relevant works, such as Zhang et al. (ECCV 2016), which achieve superior performance. This weakens the motivation and positioning of the proposed approach.
4. Unjustified Design Choices: The authors do not compare EdgeBoxes with other proposal methods (e.g., Selective Search, RPN) to justify its selection. Similarly, the paper does not address potential issues with batch normalization in Fast R-CNN, such as its sensitivity to small batch sizes.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Evaluation: Include experiments on larger and more diverse datasets like Caltech and KITTI to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the method.
2. Compare Proposal Methods: Provide a comparative analysis of EdgeBoxes against other region proposal methods to justify its use.
3. Address Batch Normalization Issues: Discuss and evaluate the impact of small batch sizes on the effectiveness of batch normalization in Fast R-CNN.
4. Update Literature Review: Cite and discuss recent works with superior results, such as Zhang et al. (ECCV 2016), and clearly position the proposed method relative to these approaches.
5. Broader Insights: Extend the scope of the paper to explore the general applicability of batch normalization in object detection tasks beyond pedestrian detection.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were larger datasets like Caltech and KITTI not included in the evaluation? Would the proposed method generalize well to these datasets?
2. How does EdgeBoxes compare to other region proposal methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency for pedestrian detection?
3. Did you observe any issues with batch normalization when using small batch sizes in Fast R-CNN? If so, how were they addressed?
4. Why was the SpatialPooling method not discussed in more detail, given that it outperforms the proposed method on INRIA?
In conclusion, while the paper demonstrates a clear and methodical approach, the contributions are incremental, and the experimental scope and literature positioning need significant improvement to meet the standards of publication.
