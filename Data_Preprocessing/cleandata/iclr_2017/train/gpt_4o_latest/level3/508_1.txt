Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces the Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN), a novel neural network architecture designed for graph classification tasks, particularly on social network data. The proposed method employs hierarchical graph decomposition (H-hierarchies) to generate vector embeddings for graph components, which are then aggregated using deep learning techniques. Additionally, the paper presents a domain compression algorithm that reduces memory usage and computational overhead by exploiting symmetries in hierarchical decompositions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SAEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several social network datasets and achieves competitive results on bioinformatics datasets. The authors highlight the scalability of their approach and its ability to handle irregular graph structures, a common characteristic of social networks.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected primarily due to the following reasons:
1. Insufficient Experimental Evidence of Superiority: While the method performs well on social network datasets, it underperforms on bioinformatics datasets compared to Niepert et al. (2016) and Yanardag et al. (2015). The lack of consistent performance across diverse datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach.
2. Weak Claims and Justifications: The claim that SAEN is tailored for social network graphs is not strongly supported by theoretical or empirical arguments. Furthermore, the suitability of the method for specific graph models remains unclear.
Supporting Arguments
1. Performance on Bioinformatics Datasets: The proposed method achieves lower accuracy on bioinformatics datasets such as NCI1, where Yanardag et al. (2015) reports 80% accuracy compared to SAEN's significantly lower performance. This discrepancy suggests that the method may not generalize well to domains outside social networks.
2. Lack of Theoretical Justification: The paper does not provide a strong theoretical rationale for why the hierarchical decomposition and the SAEN architecture are particularly effective for social network graphs. The experimental results alone are insufficient to substantiate the claim of domain-specific tailoring.
3. Unclear Applicability: The paper does not adequately address the suitability of the method for other graph models or provide insights into the types of graphs where the approach might fail.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Experimental Validation: Include additional datasets from diverse domains to evaluate the generalizability of SAEN. Provide a more detailed analysis of why the method performs poorly on bioinformatics datasets and suggest potential improvements.
2. Stronger Theoretical Justifications: Elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings of the hierarchical decomposition and its advantages for social network graphs. This could involve a formal analysis of the method's computational or representational benefits.
3. Clarify Domain-Specific Claims: If the method is indeed tailored for social networks, provide a rigorous explanation of the specific properties of social network graphs that SAEN leverages. Additionally, discuss how these properties differ from those of other graph types.
4. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of the hierarchical decomposition, the SAEN architecture, and the domain compression algorithm. This would help clarify the importance of each component.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more evidence or theoretical insights to justify the claim that SAEN is tailored for social network graphs? What specific properties of social networks does the method exploit?
2. Why does the method perform poorly on bioinformatics datasets? Are there specific characteristics of these datasets that hinder the effectiveness of SAEN?
3. How does the choice of hierarchical decomposition parameters (e.g., radii, hidden units) affect the performance across different datasets? Could this explain the observed variability in results?
In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach with promising results on social network datasets, the lack of generalizability, weak theoretical justifications, and unclear domain-specific claims limit its overall contribution. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the paper for future submissions.
