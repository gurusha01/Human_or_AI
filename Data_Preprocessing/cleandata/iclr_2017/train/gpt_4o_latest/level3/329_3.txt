Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel augmentation to GAN training by incorporating a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to guide the generator towards more probable configurations in the discriminator's feature space. The authors leverage the property of DAEs to implicitly capture the data distribution and propose a hybrid loss combining the traditional GAN objective with a denoising feature matching term. The paper demonstrates that this approach improves the stability of GAN training and enhances sample quality, particularly in diverse datasets such as CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet. The proposed method is evaluated using the Inception score, showing competitive results, and qualitative improvements in the "objectness" of generated samples are observed. The paper is well-written, logically structured, and builds upon first principles to extend existing work meaningfully.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a well-motivated and scientifically sound extension to GAN training. While the idea is not revolutionary, it is a meaningful contribution to the field, addressing a critical challenge in GAN training—stability and mode collapse—using a principled approach. The experimental results, though not exhaustive, support the claims and demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. The decision to accept is based on the novelty of combining DAEs with GANs and the potential for this approach to inspire further research.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The use of DAEs to guide GAN training is an innovative idea that builds on prior work such as feature matching and energy-based GANs. The motivation is clear: to address the instability and mode collapse issues in GANs, particularly for diverse datasets.
2. Scientific Rigor: The theoretical grounding is solid, with references to Alain & Bengio (2014) to justify the use of DAEs for estimating gradients of the data distribution. The hybrid loss formulation is well-explained, and the experiments are conducted on multiple datasets, lending credibility to the results.
3. Clarity and Structure: The paper is well-organized, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. The inclusion of qualitative and quantitative evaluations strengthens the paper.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Experimental Structure: The experiments could be more structured to provide insights into the relative merits of different design choices, such as the impact of varying the denoising term's weight or the architecture of the denoiser. Ablation studies would help isolate the contribution of the denoising feature matching term.
2. Theoretical Concerns: The validity of the Alain & Bengio (2014) intuition in a nonlinear feature space remains unclear. The authors should address whether the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation Φ(x) introduces artifacts exploitable by the optimization scheme.
3. Evaluation Metrics: While the Inception score is widely used, it has limitations. Incorporating additional metrics, such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of sample quality.
4. Non-Stationarity of Features: The authors acknowledge that the non-stationarity of the feature distribution may limit the denoiser's effectiveness. Exploring techniques to mitigate this issue, such as historical averaging or more sophisticated denoiser architectures, could strengthen the method.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to the choice of the denoiser's architecture and hyperparameters? Have alternative architectures (e.g., convolutional denoisers) been systematically explored?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the interplay between the adversarial loss and the denoising feature matching term? For instance, does the latter dominate in early training stages?
3. How does the method perform on higher-resolution datasets or in conditional GAN settings? Could the approach scale effectively to these scenarios?
In conclusion, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to GAN research by proposing a principled and effective augmentation to the training procedure. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance its impact.
