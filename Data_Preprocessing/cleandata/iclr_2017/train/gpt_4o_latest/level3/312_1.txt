Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a novel method for automating the design of neural network architectures using a recurrent neural network (RNN) controller trained with reinforcement learning. The method is applied to both convolutional architectures for image classification (CIFAR-10) and recurrent cell architectures for language modeling (Penn Treebank). The results demonstrate that NAS can generate architectures that outperform state-of-the-art human-designed models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method achieves a test error rate of 3.65% on CIFAR-10 and a test perplexity of 62.4 on Penn Treebank, setting new benchmarks in both tasks. The paper also highlights the potential of NAS to generalize across tasks, as evidenced by its successful application to character-level language modeling and machine translation tasks.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its strong empirical results, innovative approach to automating architecture design, and its relevance to advancing the field of neural network optimization. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. Significant Contribution: The paper addresses the critical problem of automating neural architecture design, which is both time-consuming and expertise-dependent. The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and datasets.
2. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is well-detailed, and the results convincingly support the claims made in the paper. The experiments are thorough and include comparisons to strong baselines.
Supporting Arguments
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper provides a strong motivation for automating architecture design, citing the challenges of manual design and the limitations of existing hyperparameter optimization methods. The use of reinforcement learning to iteratively improve the RNN controller is novel and well-placed in the literature.
2. Empirical Strength: The results are compelling, with NAS outperforming human-designed architectures on CIFAR-10 and Penn Treebank. The transfer learning experiments further validate the robustness and generalizability of the discovered architectures.
3. Broader Impact: The method has the potential to reduce reliance on expert knowledge and make neural network design more accessible, which is a significant step forward for the field.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong overall, the following points could enhance its clarity and reproducibility:
1. Hyperparameter Details: The paper lacks detailed descriptions of the hyperparameters and types of dropout used in the experiments. Providing a base set of hyperparameters, as done in prior work (e.g., Zaremba et al., 2014), would make replication easier and save time for future researchers.
2. Computational Cost: While the paper acknowledges the computational intensity of NAS, a more detailed discussion of the resources required (e.g., GPU hours) and potential strategies for reducing this cost would be valuable.
3. Ablation Studies: Additional ablation studies to isolate the contributions of specific components (e.g., skip connections, reinforcement learning) would strengthen the paper's claims.
Questions for the Authors
1. Could you provide a detailed list of hyperparameters and dropout techniques used in your experiments to facilitate reproducibility?
2. How does the computational cost of NAS compare to other architecture search methods, and are there plans to make the process more efficient?
3. Did you observe any limitations or failure cases of NAS, particularly when applied to tasks outside of the presented benchmarks?
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of automated machine learning and neural architecture search. With minor improvements to reproducibility and computational efficiency, it has the potential to set a new standard for research in this area.
