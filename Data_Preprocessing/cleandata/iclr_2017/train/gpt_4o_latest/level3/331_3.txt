The paper presents a novel approach to skill transfer between robots with differing morphologies by leveraging a task-invariant feature space. The authors propose a method that learns shared feature embeddings from a proxy task, enabling transfer of new skills between agents. The key contribution is the hypothesis that good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment, though this remains empirically unverified. The method is evaluated on simulated robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating transfer between robots with different link numbers and actuation mechanisms. The approach is argued to handle non-linear dynamics better than prior work, such as Raimalwala et al. (2016), but concerns about robustness to correspondence misspecification persist.
Decision: Reject
Key Reasons for Rejection:
1. The empirical results do not convincingly validate the central hypothesis that time alignment can reliably extract good correspondences in episodic tasks. This assumption is critical to the proposed method but remains inadequately supported.
2. The paper lacks sufficient comparisons with other state-of-the-art transfer methods discussed in Section 2, making it difficult to contextualize the claimed advantages of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments:
While the paper addresses an important problem and proposes a conceptually sound method, the reliance on time alignment for state pairing is problematic. The assumption that agents perform tasks at similar rates is overly simplistic and may not generalize across diverse scenarios. The authors mention an alternative alignment method using dynamic time warping (DTW), but its empirical evaluation is limited. Additionally, the robustness of the method to correspondence misspecification is not thoroughly explored, leaving a significant gap in the analysis. The lack of comparisons with other transfer learning methods, such as those in Section 2, further weakens the paper's claims of superiority.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Empirical Validation of Time Alignment: Provide more rigorous experiments to validate the time alignment assumption. Include scenarios where agents perform tasks at different rates to test robustness.
2. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): Explore DTW or other alignment techniques more comprehensively and compare their performance with the proposed time-based alignment.
3. Comparative Analysis: Include detailed comparisons with other transfer methods, such as CCA, UMA, and policy transfer approaches, to contextualize the advantages of the proposed method.
4. Transferable Information: Investigate what specific information is worth transferring (e.g., task structure, dynamics) and how this impacts performance.
5. Scalability: Discuss how the method scales to scenarios with more than two agents or tasks, as this is critical for practical applications.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How sensitive is the proposed method to inaccuracies in the time alignment assumption? Can it handle significant deviations in task execution rates?
2. Why was dynamic time warping not explored more extensively in the experiments, given its potential to address alignment issues?
3. Could you provide more insights into the types of features learned in the invariant space? Are they interpretable or task-specific?
4. How does the method perform in real-world settings where noise and sensor inaccuracies are prevalent?
In summary, while the paper tackles an important problem and proposes a promising direction, the lack of empirical rigor and insufficient comparisons with existing methods make it difficult to recommend acceptance in its current form. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the paper.
