Review
Summary of Contributions
The paper provides a timely and comprehensive exploration of non-maximum likelihood training methods in generative modeling, focusing on implicit generative models such as GANs. It frames these models within the broader context of likelihood-free inference, highlighting connections to hypothesis testing, density ratio estimation, and related fields like econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. A key contribution is the decoupling of generative and discriminative losses, offering a fresh perspective on objective functions for implicit generative models. The paper synthesizes various approaches to density ratio estimation—class-probability estimation, divergence minimization, ratio matching, and moment matching—into a unified framework, providing valuable insights for practitioners. However, the work raises concerns about its novelty due to similarities with Sugiyama et al.'s research, albeit in different contexts. Additionally, the absence of experiments or mathematical theorems limits its alignment with ICLR's empirical or theoretical rigor standards.
Decision: Reject
The paper is well-written and provides a rich theoretical synthesis, but it falls short on two critical fronts: (1) lack of novelty, as much of the content overlaps with existing literature, particularly Sugiyama et al.'s work, and (2) absence of empirical validation or rigorous theoretical results, which are essential for acceptance at ICLR.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty Concerns: While the paper offers a useful synthesis, many of its insights—such as the use of density ratio estimation and the decoupling of losses—are not sufficiently distinct from prior work. Sugiyama et al.'s contributions in density ratio estimation and related methods are particularly similar, raising questions about the incremental value of this paper.
   
2. Lack of Empirical or Theoretical Support: The paper does not include experiments or mathematical theorems to substantiate its claims. For instance, while it discusses various loss functions and their implications, it does not empirically compare these losses or provide theoretical guarantees about their performance. This makes it difficult to assess the practical utility or correctness of the proposed insights.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Empirical Validation: The paper would benefit greatly from experiments comparing the performance of different loss functions or density ratio estimation methods in training implicit generative models. This would provide concrete evidence for the claims made.
   
2. Theoretical Contributions: Including mathematical theorems or proofs to formalize the relationships between the proposed methods and existing approaches would strengthen the paper's scientific rigor.
   
3. Clarify Novelty: The authors should explicitly differentiate their contributions from prior work, particularly Sugiyama et al.'s research. Highlighting specific advancements or unique perspectives would help establish the paper's originality.
4. Practical Guidance: While the paper discusses several loss functions, it does not provide actionable recommendations for practitioners. A more detailed discussion on how to choose between these functions in real-world scenarios would enhance its utility.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does your work differ fundamentally from Sugiyama et al.'s research on density ratio estimation? Can you highlight specific novel contributions?
2. Why were no experiments conducted to validate the proposed insights? Are there plans to include empirical results in future work?
3. Could you provide theoretical guarantees or convergence analyses for the loss functions discussed in the paper?
In conclusion, while the paper offers a valuable synthesis of existing ideas, its lack of novelty and empirical/theoretical rigor makes it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing these issues could significantly improve its impact and relevance.
