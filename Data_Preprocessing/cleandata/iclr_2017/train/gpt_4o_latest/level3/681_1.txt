Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a scalable extension of the scattering network, introducing higher-order nonlinearities and invariant dispersion coefficients to enhance time-invariant feature extraction. The authors claim their method achieves linear complexity by performing computations entirely in the Fourier domain, leveraging sparsity for efficient storage and computation. The framework is validated on a bird song classification task, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. The paper also discusses potential applications to deep learning and scalable machine learning tasks.
Decision: Reject  
Key reasons:  
1. The mathematical derivations are unconvincing and lack clarity, particularly in Section 2.1, where the motivation for the proposed nonlinearity (|c|Â²) contradicts the cited work (Waldspurger, 2016).  
2. The experimental validation is limited and insufficient to substantiate the claims. The results lack thorough numerical comparisons with standard methods, and no empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate the claimed sparsity advantages.  
3. The paper's presentation is poor, with disorganized writing, weak connections between sections, and numerous typographical errors.
Supporting Arguments
1. Unconvincing Mathematical Derivation: The proof of the adaptive k-Lipschitz property for the proposed nonlinearity is not rigorous and lacks a clear proposition statement. Additionally, the claim that the second-order nonlinearity improves sparsity and SNR is not empirically validated.  
2. Limited Experiments: The experimental section is underwhelming. While the bird song classification task is an interesting application, the lack of direct comparisons with standard scattering networks or other baseline methods weakens the paper's impact. Metrics like running times, compression rates, and sparsity advantages are mentioned but not rigorously evaluated.  
3. Poor Presentation: The paper is difficult to follow due to disorganized writing, weak transitions between sections, and unclear figures (e.g., Figures 3 and 5). The typographical errors (e.g., "Hadamart" instead of "Hadamard") further detract from the paper's professionalism.  
Additional Feedback for Improvement
1. Rewrite for Clarity: The paper would benefit from a complete rewrite to improve structure and readability. Clearly state the motivation, contributions, and connections between sections.  
2. Strengthen Mathematical Rigor: Provide a clear proposition statement before proofs and ensure mathematical claims are well-supported. Address the apparent contradiction with Waldspurger (2016) regarding the proposed nonlinearity.  
3. Expand Experiments: Conduct more comprehensive experiments to validate the claims. Include direct comparisons with standard scattering networks and other baseline methods. Evaluate running times, compression rates, and sparsity empirically.  
4. Clarify Figures: Improve the clarity of Figures 3 and 5 by adding detailed captions and explanations. Ensure that Figure 5 includes the promised comparison to a standard scattering network implementation.  
5. Verify References: Correct typographical errors in references (e.g., "MALLAT" in the first reference) and ensure all citations are accurate and relevant.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed second-order nonlinearity address the limitations of the complex modulus, and how does it align with or differ from Waldspurger (2016)?  
2. Can you provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that the proposed higher-order nonlinearity produces sparser representations than the complex modulus?  
3. Why were comparisons with standard scattering networks omitted in Figure 5?  
4. How does the proposed framework scale with increasing input size compared to existing methods? Quantitative results would be helpful.  
5. Can you elaborate on the choice of random forests for classification and whether other classifiers were considered?  
In conclusion, while the paper presents a promising direction, significant improvements are required in mathematical rigor, experimental validation, and presentation quality to meet the standards of the conference.
