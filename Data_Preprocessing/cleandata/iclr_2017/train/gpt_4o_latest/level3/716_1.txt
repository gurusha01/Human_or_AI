Review of "ENet: A New ConvNet Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation"
The paper introduces ENet, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for real-time semantic segmentation with a focus on efficiency. The authors claim that ENet achieves comparable performance to SegNet while being up to 10x faster, requiring 10x less memory, and using significantly fewer floating-point operations. The paper emphasizes ENet's suitability for embedded systems and mobile applications, presenting detailed design choices and benchmarking results on datasets such as Cityscapes, CamVid, and SUN RGB-D.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting and practical approach to real-time semantic segmentation, it falls short in several key areas that limit its impact and relevance to the ICLR audience. The primary reasons for rejection are the low quality of the reference baseline and the lack of rigorous experimental evidence to support the design rationale.

Supporting Arguments for Decision:
1. Strengths:
   - The paper addresses an important problem: real-time semantic segmentation for resource-constrained devices.
   - ENet demonstrates impressive speed and memory efficiency, outperforming SegNet in terms of hardware requirements and inference time.
   - The design rationale is well-documented, offering insights into architectural decisions such as early downsampling, asymmetric convolutions, and dilated convolutions.
2. Weaknesses:
   - Baseline Quality: The reported performance on the Cityscapes dataset (58.3 IoU) is significantly below state-of-the-art methods (~80 IoU). While ENet excels in speed, the trade-off in accuracy is too steep, limiting its practical utility for many applications.
   - Experimental Evidence: The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies or experimental evidence to validate the claims behind specific design choices (e.g., early downsampling, factorized filters). The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of how each component contributes to the overall performance.
   - Relevance: While the focus on real-time performance is valuable, the paper's limited accuracy and lack of broader insights into semantic segmentation make it less relevant to the ICLR audience, which typically values methodological innovation and theoretical contributions.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Improve Baseline Comparisons: The authors should benchmark ENet against stronger baselines and provide a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Exploring larger models or configurations that better balance speed and accuracy could strengthen the paper's impact.
2. Ablation Studies: Conduct thorough ablation studies to empirically validate the design choices. For example, quantify the impact of early downsampling, dilated convolutions, and asymmetric filters on both accuracy and speed.
3. Clarity and Writing: The paper's clarity could be improved, particularly in Section 3, where the model architecture is described. Some sentences are unclear or poorly constructed, making it difficult to follow the technical details.
4. Trade-off Curves: Include detailed trade-off curves showing how accuracy varies with model size and inference speed. This would provide a more comprehensive view of ENet's performance across different configurations.

Questions for the Authors:
1. How does ENet perform when scaled up to larger models? Can you demonstrate a trade-off curve that balances speed and accuracy?
2. Can you provide more experimental evidence to support the design rationale, such as comparisons with alternative architectural choices (e.g., symmetric encoder-decoder designs)?
3. Why was the Cityscapes IoU so low compared to state-of-the-art methods? Are there specific limitations in ENet's design that contribute to this gap?
In conclusion, while ENet is an interesting and efficient architecture, the lack of competitive accuracy, insufficient experimental validation, and limited originality in methodology make it unsuitable for acceptance at this time. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the paper's quality and impact.
