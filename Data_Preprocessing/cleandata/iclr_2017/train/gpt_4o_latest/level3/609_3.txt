Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture tailored for graph-structured data, extending the success of CNNs in image and audio processing to non-grid data. The authors introduce a novel convolution framework that leverages a random walk on graphs to select relevant nodes, enabling weight sharing and parameter efficiency. The proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks, with preprocessing steps performed only once. The paper presents empirical results on the MNIST dataset and the Merck molecular activity dataset, claiming competitive or state-of-the-art performance. The authors argue that their approach preserves locality across varying graph structures, making it generalizable to diverse graph-based problems.
Decision: Reject  
Key Reasons:  
1. Insignificant Contribution: The proposed method offers limited novelty compared to existing work in graph-based CNNs. The use of a similarity matrix and k-nearest neighbors for context is well-established and does not advance the state of the art meaningfully.  
2. Incorrect Claims: The claim about preserving locality across different graph structures is inaccurate, as other architectures (e.g., spectral graph CNNs) already achieve this.  
3. Lack of Clarity: The presentation is convoluted, making it difficult to discern the core contributions and differentiate the proposed method from prior work.  
Supporting Arguments
- Limited Novelty: The paper builds on existing ideas, such as using similarity matrices and nearest neighbors, which are standard in graph-based learning. The random walk approach to select neighbors is not sufficiently innovative to justify a significant contribution.  
- Empirical Results: While the results on MNIST and the Merck dataset are reported as competitive, they are not compelling enough to demonstrate clear superiority over existing methods. The experimental setup lacks rigor, with hyperparameters chosen arbitrarily rather than optimized, which undermines the validity of the results.  
- Incorrect Claims: The assertion that the proposed method uniquely preserves locality across varying graph structures is misleading. Existing methods, such as spectral graph CNNs, already achieve this through weight sharing and graph Laplacian-based convolutions.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Contributions: Clearly articulate how the proposed method differs from and improves upon existing graph CNN approaches, particularly spectral and spatial methods.  
2. Strengthen Empirical Validation: Provide a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods using optimized hyperparameters. Include additional datasets to demonstrate generalizability.  
3. Improve Presentation: Simplify the mathematical exposition and focus on the intuition behind the method. Highlight the unique aspects of the approach in a concise and accessible manner.  
4. Address Incorrect Claims: Revise the claim about preserving locality to accurately reflect the capabilities of the proposed method relative to existing architectures.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method compare to spectral graph CNNs and other recent approaches in terms of computational efficiency and performance?  
2. Why were hyperparameters chosen arbitrarily rather than optimized? Could this have impacted the reported results?  
3. Can you provide more details on how the random walk approach improves over simpler methods like directly using the similarity matrix?  
4. How does the method handle graphs with highly irregular structures or sparse connectivity?  
While the paper touches on an important problem, the lack of significant contributions, incorrect claims, and unclear presentation make it unsuitable for acceptance in its current form. Addressing the above concerns could improve its impact and clarity.
