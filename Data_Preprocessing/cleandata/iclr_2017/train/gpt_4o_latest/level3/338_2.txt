Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions:
This paper presents a novel perspective on the functioning of Highway and Residual networks, proposing an "unrolled iterative estimation" viewpoint as an alternative to the traditional hierarchical representation view. The authors argue that successive layers within a stage in these architectures iteratively refine a single level of representation rather than computing entirely new representations. The paper provides mathematical derivations to unify Highway and Residual networks under this framework and offers experimental evidence to support the iterative estimation hypothesis. Additionally, the paper challenges existing interpretations of these architectures, such as their resilience to lesioning, shuffling, and dropout, and provides insights into their design choices. Comparative studies between Highway and Residual networks further highlight their similarities and differences, with implications for tasks like image classification and language modeling.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a compelling case for its proposed viewpoint, offering theoretical rigor, experimental validation, and a fresh perspective on widely used architectures. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The iterative estimation view is a well-motivated, novel contribution that challenges and extends the traditional hierarchical representation view.
2. Scientific Rigor: The mathematical derivations and experimental results are thorough and convincing, providing strong support for the claims made.
3. Impact: The proposed perspective has the potential to influence future research in understanding and improving deep architectures.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper identifies gaps in the hierarchical representation view and provides a clear rationale for the iterative estimation perspective. The discussion of evidence contradicting the traditional view (e.g., lesioning, shuffling) is thorough and well-referenced.
2. Theoretical and Empirical Validation: The derivations of Highway and Residual networks from the iterative estimation framework are mathematically sound. Empirical results, such as the analysis of estimation error across layers and comparative studies, strongly support the proposed viewpoint.
3. Clarity of Presentation: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the iterative estimation framework and its implications for network design and behavior.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Discussion on Batch Normalization: While the paper briefly touches on the role of batch normalization (BN) in Residual networks, it lacks a detailed discussion of how the iterative estimation view impacts our understanding of BN. Expanding on this could strengthen the paper's contributions.
2. Zeiler & Fergus (2014) Findings: The paper mentions that the proposed viewpoint could reinterpret findings from Zeiler & Fergus (2014) but does not elaborate. Providing an explanation or analysis of these findings through the lens of iterative estimation would enhance the paper's completeness.
3. Typographical Error: There is a minor typographical error in line 223 ("that it is valid"). This should be corrected for clarity.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the iterative estimation view reconcile with the visualization studies by Zeiler & Fergus (2014)? Could you provide specific examples or reinterpretations of their findings?
2. The paper mentions that batch normalization may act as an inductive bias for iterative estimation. Could you elaborate on how this aligns with or differs from existing interpretations of BN's role in deep networks?
3. In the comparative studies, why do Highway networks appear to underfit slightly compared to Residual networks despite having similar parameter counts? Could this be due to differences in optimization dynamics?
In conclusion, this paper provides a significant contribution to the understanding of Highway and Residual networks. While there are areas for improvement, the overall quality, novelty, and rigor of the work justify its acceptance.
