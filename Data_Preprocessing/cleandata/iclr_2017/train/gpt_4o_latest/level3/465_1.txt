The paper presents a comprehensive study on the transferability of adversarial examples in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), focusing on both non-targeted and targeted attacks. It claims to be the first to explore these phenomena at scale, using large models trained on the ImageNet dataset. The authors propose a novel ensemble-based approach to generate transferable adversarial examples, achieving significant success in targeted attacks for the first time. Additionally, the paper provides geometric insights into why adversarial examples transfer and demonstrates the practical implications of these findings by successfully attacking a commercial black-box system, Clarifai.com.
Decision: Reject
While the paper makes valuable contributions to understanding adversarial example transferability and introduces a promising ensemble-based method, the work falls short in key areas. The primary reasons for rejection are: (1) insufficient clarity in articulating the novel contributions, and (2) limited diversity in the evaluation of the ensemble method, which heavily relies on ResNet variants. These issues undermine the paper's impact and generalizability.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The paper addresses an important problem and is well-motivated, particularly in its focus on large-scale datasets and black-box attacks. However, the contributions are not clearly delineated from prior work. For instance, while the ensemble-based approach is novel, its theoretical underpinnings and distinctions from existing methods are not sufficiently emphasized.
2. Scientific Rigor: The empirical results are robust, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ensemble method for both non-targeted and targeted attacks. The geometric analysis provides intriguing insights, such as the orthogonality of gradient directions across models. However, the reliance on ResNet variants in the ensemble evaluation limits the generalizability of the findings. Including more diverse architectures (e.g., transformers or hybrid models) would strengthen the claims.
3. Clarity and Structure: The narrative structure is dense and does not adequately highlight key findings, such as the difficulty of targeted attacks and the success of the ensemble method. This makes it challenging to extract the paper's central contributions. Additionally, the geometric analysis, while insightful, could be better integrated into the main narrative.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarify Contributions: Clearly articulate the novel aspects of the ensemble-based approach and its significance compared to prior work. Highlight the practical implications of successfully attacking a black-box system like Clarifai.com.
2. Diversify Evaluation: Expand the evaluation to include a broader range of model architectures beyond ResNet variants. This would demonstrate the generalizability of the ensemble method and strengthen the paper's impact.
3. Improve Narrative Structure: Reorganize the paper to emphasize key findings, such as the ease of generating non-targeted attacks versus the challenges of targeted attacks. Streamline the geometric analysis to focus on its most impactful insights.
4. Address Practical Limitations: Discuss potential limitations of the ensemble method, such as computational overhead or its applicability to real-world scenarios with limited model access.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the ensemble method perform when applied to fundamentally different architectures, such as transformers or lightweight models like MobileNet?
2. Can the authors provide a more detailed comparison of their ensemble approach with existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?
3. What are the implications of the geometric findings (e.g., orthogonal gradient directions) for designing more robust models? Could these insights be leveraged to improve model defenses?
In summary, while the paper addresses an important problem and provides valuable insights, its lack of clarity and limited evaluation scope prevent it from meeting the standards of acceptance at this stage. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance its contribution to the field.
