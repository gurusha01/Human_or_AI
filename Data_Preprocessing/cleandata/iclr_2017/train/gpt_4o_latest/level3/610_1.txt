Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper provides a systematic evaluation of the robustness of several defense methods against adversarial attacks, including RAD, AEC, and an improved version of AEC (IAEC). It introduces a comprehensive experimental framework to analyze the performance of these methods under various adversary models, including fast gradient sign (fgs), coordinate greedy (cg), and Adam-based attacks. The authors emphasize cross-model generalization, resilience to additional attacks, and the vulnerabilities of these defense strategies. The proposed improved AEC algorithm (IAEC) incorporates a cross-entropy regularizer to enhance robustness. The paper concludes that RAD demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics, particularly in cross-model evaluations and robustness against iterative attacks, without introducing additional vulnerabilities. The experimental results are presented on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between robustness and vulnerability in adversarial defense strategies.
Decision: Reject
While the paper makes a commendable effort to evaluate defense methods comprehensively, it falls short in several critical areas that limit its contribution. The key reasons for rejection are:
1. Omission of Relevant Literature: The paper fails to include several relevant methods and prior works (e.g., references [1,2]), which could provide a more complete comparison and contextualization of the proposed methods.
2. Insufficient Experimental Details: The lack of clarity in experimental setups, such as the methodology for Table 5, makes it difficult to reproduce the results or fully assess the rigor of the experiments.
3. Unpromising Results for IAEC: The proposed improvement to AEC (IAEC) shows limited success, with experimental results indicating that it performs worse than RAD and does not significantly advance the state of the art.
Supporting Arguments
1. Thoroughness of Evaluation: The paper does an excellent job of systematically comparing defense methods and analyzing their vulnerabilities. The cross-model evaluation and investigation into additional attacks are particularly insightful, even though the conclusions about defense methods are largely negative.
2. RAD's Robustness: The results convincingly demonstrate RAD's superior performance in defending against adversarial attacks, making it a strong baseline for future work. However, this is not a novel contribution of the paper, as RAD has been previously proposed.
3. Experimental Gaps: The lack of detailed explanations for experimental setups (e.g., Table 5) undermines the scientific rigor of the paper. Additionally, the absence of a broader set of adversarial defense methods from the literature weakens the comprehensiveness of the study.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Literature Coverage: Include comparisons with other relevant defense methods from the literature to provide a more holistic evaluation. For example, methods from references [1,2] should be incorporated.
2. Clarify Experimental Details: Provide detailed descriptions of experimental setups, including the methodology for generating adversarial examples, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation metrics for all tables and figures.
3. Analyze IAEC's Limitations: Offer a deeper analysis of why IAEC underperforms and explore potential improvements to address its shortcomings.
4. Motivation for Equation (3): Clarify the motivation for Equation (3) in light of the non-convexity of Equation (2), as this is a critical step in the adversary model formulation.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why were certain relevant methods from the literature omitted, and how would including them impact the conclusions drawn in the paper?
2. Can you provide more details on the experimental setup for Table 5, including how distortion was measured and the specific parameters used for different adversary models?
3. What specific challenges did you encounter in improving AEC to IAEC, and how do you plan to address these in future work?
In summary, while the paper presents a valuable evaluation of adversarial defense methods, its omissions and lack of clarity in key areas limit its contribution. Addressing these issues could significantly strengthen the work.
