Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper proposes a novel recurrent variational neural network (VRNN) framework for volatility forecasting in financial time series. By leveraging a repeated Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure, the authors introduce a two-level recurrence mechanism to model both latent processes and observable variables. This approach demonstrates the potential of general-purpose non-linear models in volatility modeling, a significant methodological advancement in financial time series analysis. The framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming traditional econometric models like GARCH and its variants, as well as more recent methods such as `stochvol` and GPVOL. The paper also provides theoretical links between the proposed model and classical volatility models, such as GARCH(1,1) and the Heston model, positioning the proposed method as a generalization of these approaches.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of financial time series modeling by demonstrating the effectiveness of neural stochastic volatility models. While the technical novelty of the two-level recurrence is minor, the broader methodological contribution of integrating stochastic RNNs for volatility forecasting is significant. The experimental results are compelling, and the paper is well-written, making it suitable for acceptance.
Supporting Arguments
1. Significance of Contribution: The paper highlights the potential of neural time series models in financial applications, a domain traditionally dominated by econometric methods. This shift toward data-driven, non-linear modeling is an important step forward for the field.
2. Experimental Validation: The proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines across multiple metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. The inclusion of both synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the empirical evidence.
3. Clarity and Accessibility: The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, making the technical content accessible to a broad audience. The connections to existing models like GARCH and Heston provide valuable context.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Addressing Puzzling Results: The appendix shows unexpected behavior where volatility drops instead of spiking around price jumps. This anomaly requires further explanation and discussion to ensure the model's reliability.
2. Longer-Horizon Forecasts: The framework currently focuses on one-step-ahead predictions. Extending the model to handle longer-horizon forecasts would significantly enhance its practical utility.
3. Additional Baselines: Including comparisons with advanced econometric models like `fGarch` and `stochvol` in the main experiments would further validate the model's performance.
4. Model Details: The paper lacks sufficient details about the network architecture, such as the number of hidden units and embedding dimensions. Providing these details would improve reproducibility.
5. Synthetic Data Generation: More information about the data generation process for synthetic experiments is needed to assess the validity of the experimental setup.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide an explanation for the observed volatility drops around price jumps in the appendix? Is this behavior consistent across datasets?
2. How does the model perform for longer-horizon forecasts, and what modifications would be required to extend its applicability in this direction?
3. Could you elaborate on the choice of hyperparameters (e.g., embedding dimensions, LSTM size) and their impact on the model's performance?
4. Have you considered incorporating additional baselines like `fGarch` or testing the model on other financial datasets to generalize the findings?
In conclusion, the paper presents a promising approach to volatility modeling and forecasting, with clear contributions to the field. Addressing the identified issues would further strengthen the work.
