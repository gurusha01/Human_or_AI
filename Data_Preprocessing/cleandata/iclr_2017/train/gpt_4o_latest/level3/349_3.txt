Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces QRAQ (Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a novel synthetic domain designed to evaluate reasoning and interaction capabilities of conversational agents. The QRAQ domain extends the well-known bAbI tasks by incorporating unknown variables that agents must query and infer to answer challenge questions. The authors propose two reinforcement learning (RL)-based memory network architectures—baseRL and impRL—and evaluate their performance on QRAQ datasets of varying complexity. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of agent performance across metrics such as answer accuracy, trajectory accuracy, trajectory completeness, and query accuracy. The paper also compares RL-based methods with supervised learning baselines, highlighting the challenges of the RL setting. The authors argue that QRAQ represents a significant step forward in testing reasoning abilities in synthetic environments, particularly in multi-turn dialog scenarios.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-written, introduces a novel and interesting extension to bAbI tasks, and provides a rigorous evaluation of the proposed methods. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The QRAQ tasks add a reasoning layer to the largely solved bAbI tasks, making them more challenging and better aligned with the goal of testing reasoning in conversational agents.
2. Scientific Rigor: The paper provides detailed empirical results, clearly supporting the claim that the proposed architectures can solve QRAQ problems to a significant degree, even in the challenging RL setting.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Definition: The paper clearly defines the QRAQ domain and its contributions over existing benchmarks like bAbI. The introduction of variables and the requirement for multi-turn reasoning make QRAQ a meaningful addition to the field.
2. Evaluation: The evaluation is thorough, with multiple metrics capturing different aspects of agent performance. The comparison between RL and supervised learning baselines is particularly insightful, highlighting the challenges of the RL setting.
3. Architectural Improvements: The proposed impRL architecture, which uses soft attention over memory hops, demonstrates improved performance over the baseline, showcasing the authors' contributions to RL-based reasoning methods.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarification of "Interaction": While the paper claims that QRAQ tests agent interaction capabilities, the tasks primarily focus on reasoning and querying. The authors could better justify or reframe this claim to avoid overstating the interaction aspect.
2. Generalization to Natural Language: The paper acknowledges that QRAQ tasks are synthetic and not focused on natural language understanding. Future work could explore how the proposed methods generalize to more realistic, natural language-based tasks.
3. Scalability: The results indicate that the RL agents struggle with deeper problems. Additional discussion on how to improve scalability and robustness in more complex scenarios would strengthen the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the QRAQ domain compare to other recent benchmarks for reasoning and dialog, such as bAbI-dialog? Could you provide more explicit comparisons?
2. Have you considered incorporating pre-trained language models or transfer learning techniques to improve performance on the QRAQ tasks?
3. Can the proposed architectures handle more realistic dialog scenarios where natural language ambiguity and noise are present?
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of conversational AI by introducing a challenging new benchmark and demonstrating the effectiveness of RL-based reasoning architectures. While there is room for improvement, the novelty and rigor of the work warrant its acceptance.
