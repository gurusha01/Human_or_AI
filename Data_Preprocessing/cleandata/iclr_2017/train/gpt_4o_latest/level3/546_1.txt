Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Equation Learner (EQL), designed to learn interpretable analytical expressions and extrapolate to unseen domains. This approach addresses a critical gap in regression tasks, particularly in physical systems, where interpretability and extrapolation are paramount. The EQL incorporates basis functions like sine, cosine, and multiplication units to mimic the functional forms of physical equations. The authors propose a hybrid regularization strategy to achieve sparsity and unbiased parameter estimation and introduce a model selection criterion that balances validation error and sparsity to ensure good extrapolation performance. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of EQL on synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming standard methods like MLP and SVR in extrapolation tasks. The potential for interpretability is highlighted through experiments on physical systems, such as pendulum dynamics, robotic arms, and x-ray transition energies.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a promising approach, several limitations and issues prevent its acceptance in its current form. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of scalability to high-dimensional problems and the incomplete exploration of the model's universality due to the absence of division in the basis functions.
Supporting Arguments
1. Scalability Concerns: The experiments are limited to systems with up to four variables. The scalability of EQL to handle hundreds of variables, as is often required in real-world applications, remains unexplored. This significantly limits the practical applicability of the method.
2. Incomplete Universality: The model's ability to act as a universal approximator is questioned due to the absence of division in its basis functions. This limitation is particularly evident in the cart-pendulum system, where the target function lies outside the hypothesis class, leading to poor extrapolation performance.
3. Experimental Scope: While the results on synthetic and real-world datasets are promising, the experiments do not sufficiently explore the robustness of the method under varying noise levels and data sparsity. Additionally, the reliance on specific functional forms (e.g., sine and cosine) may limit generalizability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability Testing: Extend the experiments to include systems with higher dimensionality (e.g., hundreds of variables) to demonstrate the method's scalability and practical applicability.
2. Incorporate Division: Address the absence of division in the basis functions to expand the hypothesis class and improve the model's universality. This could significantly enhance performance on systems like the cart-pendulum.
3. Typographical Corrections: Correct the typographical error in the formula on Page 8 to ensure consistency with Figure 4(b).
4. Robustness Analysis: Conduct a more thorough analysis of the model's robustness to noise and varying data densities. Include experiments with diverse functional forms beyond those inspired by physical systems.
5. Comparison with Symbolic Regression: Provide a more detailed comparison with symbolic regression methods, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform when the number of variables increases significantly? Can the proposed architecture scale to hundreds of variables while maintaining interpretability and extrapolation performance?
2. What are the challenges in incorporating division into the basis functions, and how might they be addressed in future work?
3. Could the proposed model selection strategy be adapted to prioritize functional forms that are more likely to generalize to unseen domains?
4. How does the method compare to symbolic regression techniques in terms of computational complexity and runtime for high-dimensional problems?
In conclusion, while the EQL framework is a promising step toward interpretable and extrapolative regression models, the paper requires significant revisions to address scalability, universality, and robustness before it can be considered for acceptance.
