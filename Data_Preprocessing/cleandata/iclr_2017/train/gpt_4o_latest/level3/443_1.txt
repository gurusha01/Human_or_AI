The paper introduces a novel application of the Segment-to-Segment Neural Transduction (SSNT) model for noisy channel modeling, enabling the estimation of \( p(x|y) \) with incremental generation of \( y \). This approach addresses limitations of direct sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, such as explaining-away effects and the inability to leverage unpaired data effectively. The authors propose a decoding strategy that combines the SSNT-based channel model with a language model and direct model, demonstrating strong empirical results across tasks like abstractive summarization, machine translation, and morphological inflection.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a significant contribution by revisiting the noisy channel framework with modern neural architectures, offering a compelling alternative to direct seq2seq models. The empirical results are strong, showing consistent improvements over baselines, particularly in low-resource settings where unpaired data can be leveraged. However, concerns about the increased complexity of training and decoding warrant further exploration.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Well-Motivated Approach: The paper is well-placed in the literature, addressing a known limitation of seq2seq models by explicitly modeling \( p(x|y) \). The use of a latent alignment variable for tractable decoding is innovative and aligns with prior work on sequence transduction.
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments span diverse tasks, demonstrating the model's generalizability. The results convincingly show that the noisy channel model outperforms direct models, particularly when unpaired data is available.
3. Clarity and Insight: The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and detailed explanations of the model and decoding strategy. The inclusion of human evaluations further strengthens the empirical claims.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Complexity Concerns: While the noisy channel model shows strong results, the added training and decoding complexity is a valid concern. The authors should compare their approach to simpler alternatives, such as reranking outputs from standard seq2seq models. This would help clarify whether the observed gains are unique to the proposed method.
2. Clarity in Section 2: The explanation of \( p(x|y) \) in Section 2 could be more focused. The frequent switching between \( p(x|y) \) and \( p(y|x) \) may confuse readers unfamiliar with the noisy channel framework.
3. Reranking Experiments: Including experiments that rerank outputs during search could strengthen the paper's claims and address concerns about the necessity of the proposed decoding strategy.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed model scale with larger datasets and vocabularies? Are there any practical limitations in terms of memory or runtime?
2. Could the authors provide more insights into the trade-offs between the direct model and the noisy channel model in terms of computational efficiency?
3. Have the authors explored combining the noisy channel model with other techniques for leveraging unpaired data, such as back-translation?
In conclusion, the paper presents a well-motivated and empirically validated contribution to sequence transduction, with strong results and thoughtful design. Addressing the concerns about complexity and providing additional comparisons would further solidify its impact.
