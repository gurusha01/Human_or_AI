Review
Summary
This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants, addressing fundamental issues such as gradient vanishing and instability. The authors identify the root causes of these problems, particularly the role of low-dimensional manifolds and disjoint supports in the data and generator distributions. They propose a perturbation method to address these issues, which involves adding noise to the inputs of the discriminator and generator. This method is theoretically grounded and shown to smooth gradients, stabilize training, and align the generator and data distributions more effectively. The authors also establish connections between their perturbation method and the Jensen-Shannon divergence, Wasserstein distance, and contrastive divergence, offering new tools for analyzing GANs. While the theoretical contributions are significant, the empirical validation of the proposed perturbation method is limited.
Decision: Reject
The paper makes valuable theoretical contributions to understanding GAN training dynamics and proposes a promising perturbation method. However, the lack of sufficient empirical validation to support the claims limits its impact. Additional experiments are needed to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method and its performance compared to existing approaches.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The paper addresses a critical problem in GAN training—gradient vanishing and instability—and provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding these issues.
   - The proposed perturbation method is novel and theoretically well-motivated, with connections to established techniques like dropout and contrastive divergence.
   - The analysis is rigorous, with proofs and lemmas that clarify the mathematical underpinnings of the issues and solutions.
   - The discussion of alternative metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, is insightful and adds depth to the theoretical contributions.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The empirical validation is insufficient. While the authors claim that the perturbation method improves stability and gradient flow, the paper lacks comprehensive experiments comparing the proposed method to baseline GANs or other stabilization techniques.
   - The connection between the perturbation method and dropout is intriguing but underexplored. Empirical studies could help validate this analogy and its implications.
   - The paper is dense and highly technical, which might limit accessibility to a broader audience. Simplifying some of the theoretical discussions or providing more intuitive explanations could improve readability.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Empirical Validation: Conduct additional experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the perturbation method across different GAN architectures (e.g., DCGAN, WGAN) and datasets. Include metrics such as FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and IS (Inception Score) to quantify improvements in sample quality and diversity.
2. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the proposed method against existing stabilization techniques, such as spectral normalization, gradient penalty, and two-time-scale updates.
3. Exploration of Dropout Analogy: Investigate the connection between the perturbation method and dropout empirically. For example, analyze whether the perturbation method improves generalization or robustness in a manner similar to dropout.
4. Clarity and Accessibility: Simplify the presentation of theoretical results where possible. Adding visualizations or diagrams to illustrate key concepts (e.g., low-dimensional manifolds, gradient flow) would enhance understanding.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the perturbation method compare to other stabilization techniques in terms of computational overhead and performance improvements?
2. Have you tested the proposed method on large-scale datasets or more complex GAN architectures? If so, what were the results?
3. Could you provide more empirical evidence to support the claim that the perturbation method prevents adversarial examples in the generator?
4. Is there a principled way to choose the noise distribution and its variance in the perturbation method? How sensitive are the results to these choices?
In conclusion, while the paper makes significant theoretical contributions, its lack of empirical validation limits its practical impact. Addressing the above concerns would strengthen the paper and make it more compelling for acceptance.
