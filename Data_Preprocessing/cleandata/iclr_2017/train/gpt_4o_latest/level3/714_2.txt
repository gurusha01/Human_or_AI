Summary of the Paper
This paper explores the use of robotic priors, as proposed by Jonschkowski & Brock (2015), to train a deep convolutional neural network for unsupervised state representation learning. The authors employ a siamese network architecture to implement loss functions based on temporal coherence, proportionality, repeatability, and causality priors. The method is tested on a synthetic task where the goal is to learn a one-dimensional representation of a Baxter robot's head position from raw images. The paper claims that the learned representation achieves a high correlation (97.7%) with the ground truth and demonstrates robustness to noise and luminosity variations. The authors also suggest that the learned features could be useful for transfer learning in similar tasks.
Decision: Reject  
Key reasons for rejection:
1. The contribution of the paper is limited, as it primarily applies an existing approach (robotic priors) with minor modifications to a deep network.
2. The experimental evaluation is unsatisfactory, with tests conducted on a simplistic synthetic task using small datasets with minimal variability. No comparisons to existing methods or baselines are provided, leaving the utility of the approach unclear.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Contribution: The paper builds directly on the work of Jonschkowski & Brock (2015) by replacing a shallow network with a deep convolutional network. While this is a natural extension, it lacks novelty in terms of methodology or theoretical insights. The use of data augmentation and noise robustness is standard practice in deep learning and does not constitute a significant contribution.
   
2. Weak Experimental Evaluation: The experiments are conducted in a controlled, synthetic environment with limited data variability. The dataset consists of only 27 image sequences, and the task is restricted to learning a one-dimensional representation of a robot's head position. This does not convincingly demonstrate the scalability or generalizability of the approach to more complex, real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors admit that the results are preliminary.
3. Lack of Comparisons: The paper does not compare its method to existing approaches or even simple baselines, such as autoencoders or other state representation learning methods. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess the relative performance or utility of the proposed method.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Scope: Test the approach on more complex and realistic tasks, such as learning multi-dimensional state representations or applying the method to real-world datasets. This would better demonstrate the method's practical utility and robustness.
   
2. Include Baseline Comparisons: Compare the proposed method against existing state representation learning techniques, such as autoencoders, energy-based models, or other unsupervised learning approaches. This would provide a clearer understanding of the method's advantages and limitations.
3. Evaluate Task Utility: Instead of relying solely on correlation with ground truth, evaluate whether the learned representation can be effectively used in downstream tasks, such as reinforcement learning or robotic control. This would provide stronger evidence of the method's practical relevance.
4. Clarify Novelty: Highlight any unique contributions of the paper beyond the application of robotic priors to a deep network. For example, are there specific architectural innovations or insights into the use of priors that differentiate this work?
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was the method not compared to existing state representation learning approaches or simple baselines? How does it perform relative to these methods?
2. How does the approach scale to more complex tasks or higher-dimensional representations? Have you considered applying it to real-world datasets or tasks?
3. Could you elaborate on the choice of using correlation with ground truth as the primary evaluation metric? How would the method be evaluated in scenarios where ground truth is unavailable?
In summary, while the paper addresses an interesting problem and employs a promising approach, the lack of novelty, limited experimental evaluation, and absence of comparisons render it unsuitable for publication in its current form. Addressing the aforementioned issues could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
