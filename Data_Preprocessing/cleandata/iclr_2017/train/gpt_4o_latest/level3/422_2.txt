The paper introduces Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a novel method for unsupervised learning of latent Markovian state-space models, particularly for highly nonlinear sequential data. The authors emphasize the importance of latent states that retain all predictive information, enabling plausible long-term predictions and downstream applications like control tasks. The key innovation lies in enforcing state-space model assumptions by backpropagating through transitions, which shapes the latent space to fit the dynamics rather than adjusting transitions to a pre-defined latent space. The experiments demonstrate that DVBF outperforms existing methods, such as Deep Kalman Filters (DKF), in recovering latent states with full information and achieving stable long-term generative predictions.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, clearly presented, and demonstrates strong experimental results. Its contributions to learning meaningful latent representations for dynamical systems are significant, and the proposed DVBF method shows clear advantages over existing approaches. However, some areas require further clarification and improvement, as outlined below.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper addresses a critical gap in learning latent state-space models by prioritizing full-information latent states over compression. The proposed reparameterization of transitions and the use of stochastic gradient variational Bayes are innovative and well-justified.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments on dynamic systems (e.g., pendulum, bouncing balls) convincingly demonstrate the superiority of DVBF in recovering latent dynamics and achieving stable long-term predictions. The quantitative results (e.g., RÂ² scores) and qualitative visualizations are compelling.
3. Clarity: The paper is well-structured, with a clear explanation of the methodology, theoretical underpinnings, and experimental setup.
Additional Feedback for Improvement:
1. Comparison with SVAE: While the paper mentions the Structural Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) as a closely related method, the discussion is insufficient. A deeper comparison, both theoretical and experimental, is necessary to highlight the tradeoffs between SVAE's potential-based approach and DVBF's innovation-based approach. Specifically, the rationale for choosing innovations over potentials should be elaborated.
2. Control Task Motivation: The paper claims that DVBF is particularly suited for control-related tasks, but this claim is not well-supported. Including experiments or examples of control applications would strengthen this argument.
3. Failure of SVAEs: The paper states that SVAEs fail to meet the desiderata outlined in the introduction but does not provide a clear explanation or empirical evidence. This gap should be addressed to justify the need for DVBF.
4. Publicly Available Code: While the authors provide code for DVBF, a comparison with publicly available SVAE implementations would enhance the evaluation and provide a stronger baseline.
5. Uncertainty Modeling: The role of uncertainty in the data-independent distribution \( q(v) \) is unclear. The authors should clarify its implications for modeling dynamics and how it impacts the generalization capabilities of DVBF.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Can you provide a more detailed theoretical or empirical comparison between DVBF and SVAE, particularly regarding the tradeoffs between predicting innovations and potentials?
2. Why do SVAEs fail to meet the desiderata outlined in the introduction? Can you provide specific examples or experimental evidence?
3. How does the choice of \( q(v) \) as a data-independent distribution affect the model's ability to generalize to unseen sequences? Would a data-dependent approach improve performance?
4. Can you include experiments showcasing DVBF's performance in control-related tasks, as claimed in the paper?
In conclusion, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of nonlinear dynamical systems and variational inference. Addressing the above points would further strengthen its impact and clarity.
