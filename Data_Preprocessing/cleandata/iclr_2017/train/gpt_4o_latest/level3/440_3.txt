Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents a novel approach to model-based policy search in stochastic dynamical systems using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) trained via α-divergence minimization. The authors argue that α-divergence (with α = 0.5) provides a more robust and expressive alternative to variational Bayes (VB), particularly for capturing multi-modal and heteroskedastic transition dynamics. The proposed method integrates recent advances in stochastic optimization and automatic differentiation to enable efficient policy learning without requiring explicit policy gradient estimators. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the approach through experiments on challenging benchmarks (e.g., Wet-Chicken) and real-world industrial applications, such as gas turbine control. Notably, the method achieves superior performance in low-sample regimes, where traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) and VB often struggle.
Decision: Accept
The paper is technically sound, addresses a relevant and challenging problem, and provides compelling empirical evidence for its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The use of α-divergence minimization for training BNNs in reinforcement learning is innovative and well-motivated. The approach bridges gaps in existing literature by combining scalability, expressiveness, and robustness in modeling stochastic dynamics.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over VB and GPs in capturing complex dynamics and achieving better policy performance in both synthetic and real-world settings.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Relevance: The paper tackles a critical challenge in model-based reinforcement learning—accurately modeling stochastic dynamics in low-sample regimes. This is particularly important for industrial applications where data collection is expensive or risky.
2. Technical Rigor: The methodology is well-grounded in Bayesian inference and optimization theory. The use of α-divergence minimization is justified with references to prior work (Hernández-Lobato et al., 2016), and the implementation details are thorough.
3. Empirical Results: The experiments are comprehensive, covering both synthetic benchmarks (e.g., Wet-Chicken) and real-world industrial tasks. The results consistently show that α = 0.5 outperforms VB and GPs in terms of predictive accuracy and policy performance.
4. Clarity and Reproducibility: The paper provides sufficient details about the experimental setup, hyperparameters, and computational complexity, making the work reproducible.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability Concerns: While the paper acknowledges the computational overhead of BNNs trained with α-divergence, it would benefit from a more detailed discussion of scalability in high-dimensional or long-horizon tasks. Are there potential optimizations or approximations that could mitigate these costs?
2. Broader Comparisons: The experiments focus on comparisons with VB and GPs. Including additional baselines, such as modern model-free reinforcement learning methods (e.g., SAC, PPO), could strengthen the empirical claims.
3. Interpretability of α-divergence: The choice of α = 0.5 is empirically motivated, but a deeper theoretical discussion on how this value balances mode-seeking and mode-covering behavior would enhance the paper's impact.
4. Industrial Applicability: While the paper demonstrates success in industrial benchmarks, a more detailed discussion of deployment challenges (e.g., safety, real-time constraints) would make the work more actionable for practitioners.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed method to the choice of α? Would α = 0.5 generalize well across other tasks not considered in this paper?
2. What are the limitations of the proposed approach in terms of scalability and computational efficiency for larger-scale problems or higher-dimensional state-action spaces?
3. Could the method be extended to handle partially observable environments more explicitly, beyond the time-embedding approach used in the experiments?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of model-based reinforcement learning and is a strong candidate for acceptance. Addressing the suggestions above could further enhance its impact.
