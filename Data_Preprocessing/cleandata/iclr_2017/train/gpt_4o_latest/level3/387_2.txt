Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper builds upon the work of Gatys et al. by introducing a novel architectural modification to CNN-based texture synthesis. The core contribution lies in explicitly modeling longer-range correlations in texture generation using shallower CNN features, rather than relying on deeper layers. This approach allows for the generation of textures with improved spatial consistency and symmetry, addressing a key limitation of the original method. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through qualitative results in tasks such as structured texture synthesis, inpainting, and season transfer. Furthermore, the paper explores extensions to incorporate other structural properties, such as symmetry, by modifying the Gram matrices. The proposed method is simple yet impactful, and it opens up new possibilities for texture synthesis applications.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents an interesting idea and demonstrates its qualitative effectiveness, it lacks a rigorous quantitative evaluation protocol to substantiate its claims. This omission makes it difficult to assess the generalizability and robustness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the absence of a principled comparison with existing methods weakens the paper's scientific rigor.
Supporting Arguments
1. Strengths:
   - The paper addresses an important limitation of Gatys et al.'s method by introducing a simple yet effective modification to capture long-range correlations.
   - The qualitative results are compelling, particularly in structured texture synthesis and inpainting tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the baseline visually.
   - The exploration of symmetry constraints and other transformations adds versatility to the approach, showcasing its potential for broader applications.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The lack of a quantitative evaluation protocol is a significant drawback. While the authors propose a future classification-based evaluation, its absence in the current work limits the ability to objectively assess the method's performance.
   - The computational overhead introduced by the additional loss terms (an 80% increase in generation time) is not adequately justified or analyzed in comparison to existing methods.
   - The paper does not provide a thorough comparison with alternative approaches, such as patch-based methods, beyond qualitative observations. This weakens the claim of superiority over existing techniques.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Quantitative Evaluation: The authors should implement a quantitative evaluation protocol, such as texture classification accuracy or perceptual similarity metrics, to provide objective evidence of the method's effectiveness.
2. Comparison with Baselines: A more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, including both parametric and non-parametric approaches, would strengthen the paper's claims.
3. Computational Analysis: The paper should include a more detailed analysis of the computational trade-offs introduced by the additional loss terms, particularly in comparison to other methods.
4. Parameter Sensitivity: The choice of Î´ values for different layers is critical to the method's performance. A more systematic analysis of this parameter's impact would improve the reproducibility and robustness of the approach.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method perform quantitatively in tasks such as texture classification or perceptual similarity? Can you provide preliminary results for the classification-based evaluation you propose?
2. Have you considered alternative ways to reduce the computational overhead introduced by the additional loss terms?
3. How does the method generalize to textures with highly irregular or stochastic patterns? Are there failure cases, and if so, what are they?
4. Could the proposed modifications be integrated with other texture synthesis methods, such as patch-based techniques, to combine the strengths of both approaches?
In summary, while the paper introduces a promising idea with strong qualitative results, the lack of quantitative rigor and comprehensive comparisons prevents it from meeting the standards of acceptance at this stage. Addressing these issues in a future revision could significantly enhance the paper's impact.
