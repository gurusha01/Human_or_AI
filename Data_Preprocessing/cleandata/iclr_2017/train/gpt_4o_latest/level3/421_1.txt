The paper introduces a novel Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model (R-HSMM) that incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as the generative process for segmenting and labeling high-dimensional time series data in an unsupervised manner. The authors propose a bidirectional RNN (bi-RNN) encoder to approximate the posterior distribution, mimicking the forward-backward algorithm within a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. To address the challenges of training VAE models with discrete latent variables, the authors introduce a stochastic distributional penalty method. The paper demonstrates that R-HSMM achieves significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art HSMM variants and other baselines, with experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets.
Decision: Reject
While the paper presents a clever and reasonable approach to combining RNNs with HSMMs, it falls short in providing sufficient experimental validation and intuitive explanations for its modeling choices. The lack of experiments on larger, more diverse real-world datasets limits the generalizability of the claims, and the absence of a clear justification for the superiority of bi-RNN over other methods like structured mean field weakens the paper's theoretical grounding.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The integration of RNNs into HSMMs to capture nonlinear and long-range dependencies within segments is innovative and well-motivated. The use of bi-RNNs to approximate the posterior is a clever design choice that significantly accelerates inference while maintaining accuracy.
   
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness on synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets (human activity, drosophila behavior, and heart sound records). However, these datasets are relatively small, and the results may not generalize to larger, more complex datasets. The claim of "400 times faster inference" is compelling but needs validation on more computationally intensive tasks.
3. Theoretical Justification: While the paper explains the technical implementation of the bi-RNN encoder, it lacks an intuitive explanation for why bi-RNN outperforms other methods, such as structured mean field, in this context. This omission leaves a gap in understanding the broader applicability of the proposed approach.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Intuitive Explanation: The authors should provide a clear, high-level explanation of why bi-RNN is better suited for this task compared to other methods, such as structured mean field or traditional variational approximations.
   
2. Larger Datasets: To strengthen the empirical claims, the authors should evaluate the model on larger and more diverse real-world datasets. This would demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the approach.
3. Ablation Studies: Conducting ablation studies to isolate the contributions of different components (e.g., bi-RNN encoder, stochastic distributional penalty method) would clarify their respective roles in the model's performance.
4. Comparison with Additional Baselines: Including comparisons with more recent or advanced baselines, such as neural sequence models or other hybrid generative-discriminative models, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Why does the bi-RNN encoder outperform other posterior approximation methods, such as structured mean field, in this specific application? Can you provide an intuitive explanation?
2. How does the model perform on larger datasets with longer sequences, given the computational advantages claimed for the bi-RNN encoder?
3. Could the proposed stochastic distributional penalty method be applied to other models with discrete latent variables? If so, what are the potential limitations?
In summary, while the paper introduces an interesting and promising approach, the lack of broader experimental validation and theoretical clarity prevents it from meeting the standards for acceptance at this stage. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the paper's impact and rigor.
