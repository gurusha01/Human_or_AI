This paper extends mostly on top of the work of QA-biLSTM and QA-biLSTM with attentions, as proposed in Tan et al. 2015 and Tan et al. 2016, in the following 2 ways:
1. It trains a topic-specific word embedding using an approach similar to Paragraph2vec by leveraging the topic and title information provided in the data.
2. It considers the multiple-unit answer selection problem (e.g., one sentence selected from answer section, and another selected from supplemental section) vs. the single answer selection problem as studied in Tan et al 2015 and 2016. The mechanism used to retain the coherence between different parts of the answers is inspired by the attention mechanism introduced by Tan et al. 2016.
While the practical results presented in the paper is interesting, the main innovations of this paper are rather limited.
