The authors present a dataset extraction method, dataset and first interesting results for machine-learning supported higher order logic theorem proving. The experimental results are impressively good for a first baseline and with an accuracy higher than 0.83 in relevance classification a lot better than chance, and encourage future research in this direction. The paper is well-written in terms of presentation and argumentation and leaves little room for criticism. The related work seems to be well-covered, though I have to note that I am not an expert for automated theorem proving.
