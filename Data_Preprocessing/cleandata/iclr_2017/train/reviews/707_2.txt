This paper explores 3 language modeling applications with an explicit modeling of reference expressions: dialog, receipt generation and coreferences. While these are important tasks for NLP and the authors have done a number of experiments, the paper is limited for a few reasons:
1. This paper is not clearly written and is pretty hard to follow some details. In particular,  there are many obvious math errors, such as missing the marginalization sum in Eq (1), and P(z_{i,v}...) = 1 (should be 0 here) on page 5, pointer switch section.
2. The major novelty seems to be the 2-dimensional attention from the table and the pointer to the 2-D table. These are more of a customization of existing work to a particular task with 2-D tables as a part of the input to seq2seq model with both attentions and pointer networks.
3. The empirical results are not very conclusive yet, limited by either the relatively small data size, or the lack of well-established baseline for some new applications (e.g., the recipe generation task).
Overall, this paper, as it is for now, is more suitable for a workshop rather than for the main conference.
