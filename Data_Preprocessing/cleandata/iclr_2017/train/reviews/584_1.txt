The authors propose a transfer learning approach applied to a number of NLP tasks; the set of tasks appear to have an order in terms of complexity (from easy syntactic tasks to somewhat harder semantic tasks).
Novelty: the way the authors propose to do transfer learning is by plugging models corresponding to each task, in a way that respects the known hierarchy (in terms of NLP "complexity") of those tasks. In that respect, the overall architecture looks more like a cascaded architecture than a transfer learning one. There are some existing literature in the area (first two Google results found:
