The authors present a way to complement the Gerative Adversarial Network traning procedure with an additional term based on denoising autoencoders. The use of denoising autoencoders is motivated by the observation that they implicitly capture the distribution of the data they were trained on. While sampling methods based denoising autoencoders alone don't amount to very interesting generative models (at least no-one could demonstrate otherwise), this paper shows that it can be combined successfully with generative adversarial networks.
My overall assessment of this paper is that it is well written, well reasoned, and presents a good idea motivated from first principles. I feel that the idea presented here is not revolutionary or a very radical departure from what has been done before, I would have liked a slightly more structured experiments section which focusses on and provides insights into the relative merits of different choices one could make (see pre-review questions for details), rather than focussing just on demonstrating that a chosen variant works.
In addition to this general review, I have already posted specific questions and criticism in the pre-review questions - thanks for the authors' responses. Based on those responses the area I am most uncomfortable about is whether the (Alain & Bengio, 2014) intuition about the denoising autoencoders is valid if it all happens in a nonlinear featurespace. If the denoiser function's behaviour ends up depending on the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation Phi, another question is whether this dependence is exploitable by the optimization scheme.
