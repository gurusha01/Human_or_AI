This paper proposes a variety of techniques for visualizing learned generative models, focussing specifically on VAE and GAN models. This paper is somewhat challenging to assess since it doesn't propose a new algorithm, model, application etc. On the one hand these techniques will be highly relevant to the generative modeling community and I think this paper deserves a wide audience. The techniques proposed are simple, well explained, and of immediate use to those working on generative models. However, I'm not sure the paper is appropriate for an ICLR conference track as it doesn't provide any greater theoretical insights into sampling generative models and there are no comparisons / quantitative evaluations of the techniques proposed. Overall, I'm very much on the fence since I think the techniques are useful and this paper should be read by those interested in generating modeling. I would be willing to increase my core if the author could present a case for why ICLR is an appropriate venue for this work.
Could you please explain why the spherical interpolation is better when the prior is uniform?
