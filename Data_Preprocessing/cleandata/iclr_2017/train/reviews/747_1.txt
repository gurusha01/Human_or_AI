This paper proposes a new method, interior gradients, for analysing feature importance in deep neural networks.  The interior gradient is the gradient measured on a scaled version of the input.  The integrated gradient is the integral of interior gradients over all scaling factors.  Visualizations comparing integrated gradients with standard gradients on real images input to the Inception CNN show that integrated gradients correspond to an intuitive notion of feature importance.
While motivation and qualitative examples are appealing, the paper lacks both qualitative and quantitative comparison to prior work.  Only the baseline (simply the standard gradient) is presented as reference for qualitative comparison.  Yet, the paper cites numerous other works (DeepLift, layer-wise relevance propagation, guided backpropagation) that all attack the same problem of feature importance.  Lack of comparison to any of these methods is a major weakness of the paper.  I do not believe it is fit for publication without such comparisons.  My pre-review question articulated this same concern and has not been answered.
