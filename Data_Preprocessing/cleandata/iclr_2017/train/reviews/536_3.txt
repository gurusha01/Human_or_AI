The approximation capabilities of neural networks have been studied before for approximating different classes of functions. The goal of this paper is to provide an analog of the approximation theorem for the class of noise-stable functions. The class of functions that are noise-stable and their output does not significantly depend on an individual input seems an interesting class and therefore I find the problem definition interesting.  The paper is well-written and it is easy to follow the proofs and arguments. 
I have two major comments:
1- Presentation: The way I understand this arguments is that the noise-stability measures the "true" dimensionality of the data based on the dependence of the function on different dimensions. Therefore, it is possible to restate and prove an analog to the approximation theorems based on "true" dimensionality of data. It is also unclear when the stability based bounds are tighter than dimension based bounds as both of them grow exponentially. I find these discussions interesting but unfortunately, the authors present the result as some bound that does not depend on the dimension and a constant (!??) that grows exponentially with (1/eps). This is not entirely the right picture because the epsilon in the stability could itself depend on the dimension. I believe in most problems (1/epsilon) grows with the dimension. 
2- Contribution: Even though the connection is new and interesting, the contribution of the paper is not significant enough. The presented results are direct applications of previous works and most of the lemmas in the paper are restating the known results. I believe more discussions and results need to be added to make this a complete work.
