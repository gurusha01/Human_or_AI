The authors present a method for changing the objective of generative adversarial networks such that the discriminator accurately recovers density information about the underlying data distribution. In the course of deriving the changed objective they prove that stability of the discriminator is not guaranteed in the standard GAN setup but can be recovered via an additional entropy regularization term.
The paper is clearly written, including the theoretical derivation. The derivation of the additional regularization term seems valid and is well explained. The experiments also empirically seem to support the claim that the proposed changed objective results in a "better" discriminator. There are only a few issues with the paper in its current form:
- The presentation albeit fairly clear in the details following the initial exposition in 3.1 and the beginning of 3.2 fails to accurately convey the difference between the energy based view of training GANs and the standard GAN. As a result it took me several passes through the paper to understand why the results don't hold for a standard GAN. I think it would be clearer if you state the connections up-front in 3.1 (perhaps without the additional f-gan perspective) and perhaps add some additional explanation as to how c() is implemented right there or in the experiments (you may want to just add these details in the Appendix, see also comment below).
- The proposed procedure will by construction only result in an improved generator and unless I misunderstand something does not result in improved stability of GAN training. You also don't make such a claim but an uninformed reader might get this wrong impression, especially since you mention improved performance compared to Salimans et al. in the Inception score experiment. It might be worth-while mentioning this early in the paper.
- The experiments, although well designed, mainly convey qualitative results with the exception of the table in the appendix for the toy datasets. I know that evaluating GANs is in itself not an easy task but I wonder whether additional more quantitative experiments could be performed to evaluate the discriminator performance. For example: one could evaluate how well the final discriminator does separate real from fake examples, how robust its classification is to injected noise (e.g. how classification accuracy changes for noised training data). Further one might wonder whether the last layer features learned by a discriminator using the changed objective are better suited for use in auxiliary tasks (e.g. classifying objects into categories).
- Main complaint: It is completely unclear what the generator and discriminators look like for the experiments. You mention that code will be available soon but I feel like a short description at least of the form of the energy used should also appear in the paper somewhere (perhaps in the appendix).
