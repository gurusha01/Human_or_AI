The authors introduce a semi-supervised method for neural networks, inspired from label propagation.
The method appears to be exactly the same than the one proposed in (Weston et al, 2008) (the authors cite the 2012 paper). The optimized objective function in eq (4) is exactly the same than eq (9) in (Weston et al, 2008).
As possible novelty, the authors propose to use the adjacency matrix as input to the neural network, when there are no other features, and show success on the BlogCatalog dataset.
Experiments on text classification use neighbors according to word2vec average embedding to build the adjacency matrix. Top reported accuracies are not convincing compared to (Zhang et al, 2015) reported performance. Last experiment is on semantic intent classification, which a custom dataset; neighbors are also found according to a word2vec metric.
In summary, the paper propose few applications to the original (Weston et al, 2008) paper. It rebrands the algorithm under a new name, and does not bring any scientific novelty, and the experimental section lacks existing baselines to be convincing.
