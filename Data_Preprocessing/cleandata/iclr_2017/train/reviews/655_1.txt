This work proposes to use basic probability assignment to improve deep transfer learning. A particular re-weighting scheme inspired by Dempster-Shaffer and exploiting the confusion matrix of the source task is introduced. The authors also suggest learning the convolutional filters separately to break non-convexity. 
The main problem with this paper is the writing. There are many typos, and the presentation is not clear. For example, the way the training set for weak classifiers are constructed remains unclear to me despite the author's previous answer. I do not buy the explanation about the use of both training and validation sets to compute BPA. Also, I am not convinced non-convexity is a problem here and the author does not provide an ablation study to validate the necessity of separately learning the filters. One last question is CIFAR has three channels and MNIST only one: How it this handled when pairing the datasets in the second set of experiments?
Overall, I believe the proposed idea of reweighing is interesting, but the work can be globally improved/clarified. 
I suggest a reject.
