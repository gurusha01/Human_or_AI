This paper describes a way to speed up convergence through sudden increases of otherwise monotonically decreasing learning rates. Several techniques are presented in a clear way and parameterized method is proposed and evaluated on the CIFAR task. The concept is easy to understand and the authors chose state-of-the-art models to show the performance of their algorithm. The relevance of these results goes beyond image classification.
Pros:
- Simple and effective method to improve convergence
- Good evaluation on well known database
Cons:
- Connection of introduction and topic of the paper is a bit unclear
- Fig 2, 4 and 5 are hard to read. Lines are out of bounds and maybe only the best setting for T0 and Tmult would be clearer. The baseline also doesn't seem to converge
Remarks:
An loss surface for T0 against Tmult would be very helpful. Also understanding the relationship of network depth and the performance of this method would add value to this analysis.
