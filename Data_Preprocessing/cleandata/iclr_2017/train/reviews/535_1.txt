This paper presents a model for video captioning with both soft and hard attention, using a C3D network for the encoder and a RNN for the decoder. Experiments are presented on YouTube2Text, M-VAD, and MSR-VTT. While the ideas of image captioning with soft and hard attention, and video captioning with soft attention, have already been demonstrated in previous work, the main contribution here is the specific architecture and attention over different layers of the CNN.
The work is well presented and the experiments clearly show the benefit of attention over multiple layers. However, in light of previous work in captioning, the contribution and resulting insights is too incremental for a conference paper at ICLR. Further experiments and analysis of the main contribution would strengthen the paper, but I would recommend resubmission to a more suitable venue.
