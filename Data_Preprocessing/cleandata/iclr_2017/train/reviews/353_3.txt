All in all this is a nice paper.
I think the model is quite clever, attempting to get the best of latent variable models and auto-regressive models. The implementation and specific architecture choices (as discussed in the pre-review) also seem reasonable.
On the experimental side, I would have liked to see something more than NLL measurements and samples - maybe show this is useful for other tasks such as classification?
Though I don't think this is a huge leap forward this is certainly a nice paper and I recoemmend acceptance.
