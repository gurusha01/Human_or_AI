Thank you for an interesting angle on highway and residual networks. This paper shows a new angle to how and what kind of representations are learnt at each layer in the aforementioned models. Due to residual information being provided at a periodic number of steps, each of the layers preserve feature identity which prevents lesioning unlike convolutional neural nets.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                      
- the iterative unrolling view was extremely simple and intuitive, which was supported by theoretical results and reasonable assumptions.                                                                 
- Figure 3 gave a clear visualization for the iterative unrolling view

- Even though, the perspective is interesting few empirical results were shown to support the argument. The major experiments are image classification and language models trained on mutations of character-aware neural language models.                                                                                                                                                                         
- Figure 4 and 5 could be combined and enlarged to show the effects of batch normalization.
