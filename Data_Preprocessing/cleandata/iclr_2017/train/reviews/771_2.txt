This paper tries to leverage an external lexicon / knowledge base to improve corpus-based word representations by determining (in a fuzzy way) which potential paraphrase is the most appropriate in a particular context.
I think this paper is a bit lost in translation. The grammatical and storytelling styles made it really difficult for me to concentrate, and even unintelligible at times. One of the most important criteria in a conference paper is to communicate one's ideas clearly; unfortunately, I do not feel that this paper meets that standard.
In addition, the evaluation is rather lacking. There are many ways to evaluate word representations, and Google's analogy dataset has many issues (see, for example, Linzen's paper from RepEval 2016, as well as Drozd et al., COLING 2016).
Finally, this work does not provide any qualitative result or motivation. Why does this method work better? Where does it fail? What have we learned about word representations / lexicons / corpus-based methods in general?
