This paper proposed a novel adversarial framework to train a model from demonstrations in a third-person perspective, to perform the task in the first-person view. Here the adversarial training is used to extract a novice-expert (or third-person/first-person) independent feature so that the agent can use to perform the same policy in a different view point.
While the idea is quite elegant and novel (I enjoy reading it), more experiments are needed to justify the approach. Probably the most important issue is that there is no baseline, e.g., what if we train the model with the image from the same viewpoint? It should be better than the proposed approach but how close are they? How the performance changes when we gradually change the viewpoint from third-person to first-person? Another important question is that maybe the network just blindly remembers the policy, in this case, the extracted feature could be artifacts of the input image that implicitly counts the time tick in some way (and thus domain-agonistic), but can still perform reasonable policy. Since the experiments are conduct in a synthetic environment, this might happen. An easy check is to run the algorithm on multiple viewpoint and/or with blurred/differently rendered images, and/or with random initial conditions.
Other ablation analysis is also needed. For example, I am not fully convinced by the gradient flipping trick used in Eqn. 5, and in the experiments there is no ablation analysis for that (GAN/EM style training versus gradient flipping trick). For the experiments, Fig. 4,5,6 does not have error bars and is not very convincing.
