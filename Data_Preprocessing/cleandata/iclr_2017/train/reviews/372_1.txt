This paper proposes a new memory module for large scale life-long and one-shot learning. The module is general enough that the authors apply the module to several neural network architectures and show improvements in performance.
Using k-nearest neighbors for memory access is not completely new. This has been recently explored in Rae et al., 2016 and Chandar et al., 2016. K-nearest neighbors based memory for one-shot learning has also been explored in [R1]. This paper provides experimental evidence that such an approach can be applied to a variety of architectures.
Authors have addressed all my pre-review questions and I am ok with their response.
Are the authors willing to release the source code to reproduce the results? At least for omniglot experiments and synthetic task experiments?
