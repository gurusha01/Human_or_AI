This paper proposes b-GAN, which trains a discriminator by estimating density ratio that minimizes Bregman divergence. The authors also discuss how b-GANs relate to f-GAN and the original GAN work, providing a unifying view through the lens of density ratio estimation. 
Note that the unifying view applies only to GAN variants which optimize density ratios. In general, GANs which use MMD in the discriminator step do not fit in the b-GAN framework except for special choices of the kernel. 
I was a bit confused about the dual relationship between f-GAN and b-GAN. Are the conditions on the function f the same in both cases? If so, what's the difference between f-GAN and b-GAN (other than the fact that the former has been derived using f-divergence and the latter has been derived using Bregman divergence)?
One of the original claims was that b-GANs optimize f-divergence directly as opposed to f-GAN and GAN. However, in practice, the authors optimize an approximation to the f-divergence; the quality of the approximation is not quantified anywhere, so b-GAN doesn't seem more principled than f-GAN and GAN.
The experiments left me a bit confused and were not very illuminating on the choice of f. 
Overall, I liked the connections to the density ratio estimation literature. The appendix seems like a scattered collection right now. Some re-writing of the text would significantly improve this paper.
