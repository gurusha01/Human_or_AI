This paper introduces a new dataset to evaluate word representations. The task considered in the paper, called outlier detection (also known as word intrusion), is to identify which word does not belong to a set of semantically related words. The task was proposed by Camacho-Collados & Navigli (2016) as an evaluation of word representations. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new dataset for this task, covering 5 languages. The dataset was generated automatically from the Wikidata hierarchy.
Entities which are instances of the same category are considered as belonging to the same cluster, and outliers are sampled at various distances in the tree. Several heuristics are then proposed to exclude uninteresting clusters from the dataset.
Developing good ressources to evaluate word representations is an important task. The new dataset introduced in this paper might be an interesting addition to the existing ones (however, it is hard to say by only reviewing the paper). I am a bit concerned by the lack of discussion and comparison with existing approaches (besides word similarity datasets). In particular, I believe it would be interesting to discuss the advantages of this evaluation/dataset, compared to existing ones such as word analogies. The proposed evaluation also seems highly related to entity typing, which is not discussed in the paper.
Overall, I believe that introducing ressources for evaluating word representations is very important for the community. However, I am a bit ambivalent about this submission. I am not entirely convinced that the proposed dataset have clear advantages over existing ressources. It also seems that existing tasks, such as entity typing, already capture similar properties of word representations. Finally, it might be more relevant to submit this paper to LREC than to ICLR.
