This paper proposes a pedestrian detection method using Fast RCNN framework with batch normalization, where EdgeBoxes is used to collect pedestrian proposals instead of selective search as used in the original Fast RCNN method. The proposed method is evaluated in INRIA and ETH dataset.
Pros:
- The proposed method shows good performance(but not state-of-the-art).
Cons:
- Lack of novelty. Fast RCNN and its variants (e.g. FasterRCNN,
