The paper proposed a very complex compression and reconstruction method (with additional parameters) for reducing the memory footprint of deep networks.
The authors show that this complex proposal is better than simple hashed net proposal. One question: Are you also counting the extra parameters for reconstruction network for the memory comparison? Otherwise, the experiments are unfair.  
Since hashing and reconstruction cost will dominate the feed-forward and back-propagation updates, it is imperative to compare the two methods on running time. For hashed net, this is quite simple, yet it created an additional bottleneck.  Please also show the impact on running time. Small improvements for a big loss in computational cost may not be acceptable. I am not convinced that this method will be lightweight. If we are allowed complicated compression and reconstruction then we can use any off-shelf methods, but the cost will be huge
