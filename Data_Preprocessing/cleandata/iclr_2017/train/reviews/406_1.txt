This paper explores ensemble optimisation in the context of policy-gradient training. Ensemble training has been a low-hanging fruit for many years in the this space and this paper finally touches on this interesting subject. The paper is well written and accessible. In particular the questions posed in section 4 are well posed and interesting.
That said the paper does have some very weak points, most obviously that all of its results are for a very particular choice of domain+parameters. I eagerly look forward to the journal version where these experiments are repeated for all sorts of source domain/target domain/parameter combinations.
