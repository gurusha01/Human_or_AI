This paper applies the idea of the adversarial training and virtual adversarial training to the LSTM-based model in the text context. The paper is in general well written and easy to follow. Extending the idea of the adversarial training to the text tasks is simple but non-trivial. Overall the paper is worth to publish. 
I only have a minor comment: it is also interesting to see how much adversarial training can help in the performance of RNN, which is a simpler model and may be easier to analyze.
