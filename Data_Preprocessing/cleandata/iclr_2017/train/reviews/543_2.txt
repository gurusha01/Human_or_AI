While it is interesting that this can be done, and it will be useful for some, it does seem like the audience is not really the mainstream ICLR audience, who will not be afraid to use a conventional ML toolkit. 
There is no new algorithm here, nor is there any UI/meta-design improvement to make it easier for non-experts to design and train neural network systems. 
I think there will be relatively little interest at ICLR in such a paper that doesn't really advance the state of the art. 
I have no significant objection to the presentation or methodology of the paper.
