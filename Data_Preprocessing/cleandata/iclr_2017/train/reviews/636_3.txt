The paper presents an approach for compensating the input/activation variance introduced by dropout in a network. Additionally, a practical inference trick of re-estimating the batch normalization parameters with dropout turned off before testing. 
The authors very well show how dropout influences the input/activation variance and then scale the initial weights accordingly to achieve unit variance which helps in avoiding activation outputs exploding or vanishing. It is shown that the presented approach serves as a good initialization technique for deep networks and results in performances op par or slightly better than the existing approaches. The limited experimental validation and only small difference in accuracies compared to existing methods makes it difficult to judge the effectiveness of presented approach. Perhaps observing the statistics of output activations and gradients over training epochs in multiple experiments can better support the argument of stability of the network using proposed approach.
Authors might consider adding some validation for considering the backpropagation variance. On multiple occasions comparison is drawn against batch normalization which I believe does much more than a weight initialization technique. The presented approach is a good initialization technique just not sure if its better than existing ones.
