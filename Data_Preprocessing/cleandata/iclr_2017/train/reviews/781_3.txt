This paper proposes a new kind of expert model where a sparse subset of most reliable experts is chosen instead of the usual logarithmic opinion pool of a PoE.
I find the paper very unclear. I tried to find a proper definition of the joint model p(x,z) but could not extract this from the text. The proposed "EM-like" algorithm should then also follow directly from this definition. At this point I do not see if such as definition even exists. In other words, is there is an objective function on which the iterates of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to improve on the train data?
We also note that the "product of unifac models" from Hinton tries to do something very similar where only a subset of the experts will get activated to generate the input:
