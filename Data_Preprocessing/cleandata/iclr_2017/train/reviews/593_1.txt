This paper investigates deep generative models with multiple stochastic nodes and gives them meaning by semi-supervision. From a methodological point of view, there is nothing fundamentally novel (it is very similar to the semi-supervised work of Kingma et al; although this work has sometimes more than two latent nodes, it is not a complex extension). There is a fairly classical auxiliary variable trick used to make sure the inference network for y is trained over all data points (by supposing y is in fact is a latent variable with an observation \tilde y; the observation is y if y is observed, or uninformative for unobserved y). Alternatively, one can separate the inference used to learn the generative model (which throws out inference over y if it is observed), from an inference used to 'exercise' the model (approximate the complex p(y|x) in the model by a simpler q(y|x) - effectively inferring the target p(y|x) for the data where only x is collected). Results are strong, although on simple datasets. Overall this is a well written, interesting paper, but lacking in terms of methodological advances.
Minor:
- I feel the title is a bit too general for the content of the paper. I personally don't agree with the strong contrast made between deep generative models and graphical models (deep generative models are graphical models, but they are more typically learned and un-interpretable than classical graphical models; and having multiple stochastic variables is not exclusive to graphical models, see DRAW, Deep Kalman Filter, Recurrent VAE, etc.). The word 'structure' is a bit problematic; here, the paper seems more concerned with disentangling and semanticizing the latent representation of a generative model by supervision. It is debatable whether the models themselves have structure.
