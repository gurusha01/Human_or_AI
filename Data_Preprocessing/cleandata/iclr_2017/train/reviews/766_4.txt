This paper presents experimental results from an EdgeBoxes + Fast R-CNN detector on the task of localizing pedestrians. It uses an AlexNet (CaffeNet) backbone architecture modified to include batch normalization. Experimental results are presented on the INRIA and ETH datasets.
Pros
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow
Cons
- The paper's two contributions are too minor to merit publication
- Experimental results should include at least the Caltech pedestrian dataset but likely also the KITTI pedestrian dataset
- Recent work from ECCV 2016 [a], with superior results and much more experimental evaluation, is not cited or discussed
My rating is due primarily to the lack luster contributions. The first claimed contribution is the use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection. Unless the result of this choice produced a truly surprising experimental result, this is simply too minor to be considered a contribution. Moreover, if this choice is important, then the paper should justify it by showing that other proposal methods (of which there are a great many in addition to Selective Search and Edge Boxes) are worse performing in some regard (speed, accuracy, memory, etc.). The second claimed contribution is the use of batch normalization (BN) in their network architecture. There is a case to be made that BN hasn't been explored in Fast R-CNN. However, if the goal of the paper was to thoroughly explore BN + Fast R-CNN, then why focus narrowly on pedestrian detection? Instead, it should focus more broadly on generic object category detection for which there are well established Fast R-CNN baselines on PASCAL VOC and COCO. The use of BN + Fast R-CNN only for pedestrian detection does not provide much signal about this choice. There are also potential technical issues that are not discussed. BN is typically avoided in Fast R-CNN because the batch size seen by most of the network is usually only one or two images. This is likely too few images for the naive application of BN.
