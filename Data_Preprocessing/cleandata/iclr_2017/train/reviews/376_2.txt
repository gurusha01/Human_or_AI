CONTRIBUTIONS
Large-scale experiments are used to measure the capacity and trainability of different RNN architectures. Capacity experiments suggest that across all architectures, RNNs can store between three and six bits of information per parameter, with ungated RNNs having the highest per-parameter capacity. All architectures are able to store approximately one floating point number per hidden unit. Trainability experiments show that ungated architectures (RNN, IRNN) are much harder to train than gated architectures (GRU, LSTM, UGRNN, +RNN). The paper also proposes two novel RNN architectures (UGRNN and +RNN); experiments suggest that the UGRNN has similar per-parameter capacity as the ungated RNN but is much easier to train, and that deep (8-layer) +RNN models are easier to train than existing architectures.
CLARITY
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
NOVELTY
This paper is the first to my knowledge to empirically measure the number of bits of information that can be stored per learnable parameter. The idea of measuring network capacity by finding the dataset size and other hyperparameters that maximizes mutual information is a particularly novel experimental setup.
The proposed UGRNN is similar but not identical to the minimal gated unit proposed by Zhou et al, "Minimal Gated Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks", International Journal of Automation and Computing, 2016.
SIGNIFICANCE
I have mixed feelings about the significance of this paper. I found the experiments interesting, but I don't feel that they reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected about recurrent networks; it is hard to see how any of the experimental results will change the way either that I think about RNNs, or the way that I will use them in my own future work. On the other hand it is valuable to see intuitive results about RNNs confirmed by rigorous experiments, especially since few researchers have the computational resources to perform such large-scale experiments.
The capacity experiments (both per-parameter capacity and per-unit capacity) essentially force the network to model random data. For most applications of RNNs, however, we do not expect them to work with random data; instead when applied in machine translation or language modeling or image captioning or any number of real-world tasks, we hope that RNNs can learn to model data that is anything but random. It is not clear to me that an architecture's ability to model random data should be beneficial in modeling real-world data; indeed, the experiments in Section 2.1 show that architectures vary in their capacity to model random data, but the text8 experiments in Section 3 show that these same architectures do not significantly vary in their capacity to model real-world data.
I do not think that the experimental results in the paper are sufficient to prove the significance of the proposed UGRNN and +RNN architectures. It is interesting that the UGRNN can achieve comparable bits per parameter as the ungated RNN and that the deep +RNNs are more easily trainable than other architectures, but the only experiments on a real-world task (language modeling on text8) do not show these architectures to be significantly better than GRU or LSTM.
SUMMARY
I wish that the experiments had revealed more surprising insights about RNNs, though there is certainly value in experimentally verifying intuitive results. The proposed UGRNN and +RNN architectures show some promising results on synthetic tasks, but I wish that they showed more convincing performance on real-world tasks. Overall I think that the good outweighs the bad, and that the ideas of this paper are of value to the community.
PROS
- The paper is the first of my knowledge to explicitly measure the bits per parameter that RNNs can store
- The paper experimentally confirms several intuitive ideas about RNNs:
    - RNNs of any architecture can store about one number per hidden unit from the input
    - Different RNN architectures should be compared by their parameter count, not their hidden unit count
    - With very careful hyperparameter tuning, all RNN architectures perform about the same on text8 language modeling
    - Gated architectures are easier to train than non-gated RNNs
CONS
- Experiments do not reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected
- The UGRNN and +RNN architectures do not feel well-motivated
- The utility of the UGRNN and +RNN architectures is not well-established
