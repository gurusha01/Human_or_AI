The multiagent system is proposed as a generalization of neural network. The proposed system can be used with less restrictive network structures more efficiently by computing only those necessary computations in the graph. Unfortunately, I don't find the proposed system different from the framework of artificial neural network. Although for today's neural network structures are designed to have a lot of matrix-matrix multiplications, but it is not limited to have such architecture. In other words, the proposed multiagent system can be framed in the artificial neural network with more complicated layer/connectivity structures while considering each neuron as layer. The computation efficiency is argued among different sparsely connected denoising autoencoder in multiagent system framework only but the baseline comparison should be against the fully-connected neural network that employs matrix-matrix multiplication.
