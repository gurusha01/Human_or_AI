Authors take the skip-graph architecture (Kiros 2015) and apply it to classifying labeled graphs (molecular graphs). They do it by creating many sentences by walking the graph randomly, and asking the model to predict previous part and next part from the middle part. Activations of the decoder part of this model on a walk generated from a new graph are used as features for a binary classifier use to predict whether the molecule has anti-cancer properties.
Paper is well written, except that evaluation section is missing details of how the embedding is used for actual classification (ie, what classifier is used)
Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the dataset and how hard it is to achieve the results they demonstrate, that would be the important factor to weight on the papers acceptance.
