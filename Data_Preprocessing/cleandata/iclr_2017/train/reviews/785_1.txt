This paper introduces a neural network architecture and training procedure for predicting the speed of a vehicle several seconds into the future based on video and vehicle state input. The architecture allows several RNNs to compete to make the best predictions, with only the best prediction receiving back propagation training at each time step. Preliminary experimental results show that this scheme can yield reduced prediction error.
 It is not clear how the best-performing RNN is chosen for each time point at test time. That is, how is the "integrated prediction" obtained in Fig. 7? Is the prediction the one with minimum error over all of the output layers? If so, this means the prediction cannot be made until you already know the value to be predicted.
It seems possible that a larger generic RNN might be able to generate accurate predictions. If I understand correctly, the competitive architectures have many more parameters than the baseline. Is the improved performance here due to the competitive scheme, or just a larger model? 
A large amount of additional work is required to sustain the claim that this scheme is successfully extracting driver 'intentions'. It would be interesting to see if the scheme, suitably extended, can automatically infer the intention to stop at a stop sign vs slowing but not stopping due to a car in front, say, or to pass a car vs simply changing lanes. Adding labels to the dataset may enable this comparison more clearly.
More generally, the intention of the driver seems more related to the goals they are pursuing at the moment; there is a fair amount of work in inverse reinforcement learning that examines this problem (some of it in the context of driving style as well).
