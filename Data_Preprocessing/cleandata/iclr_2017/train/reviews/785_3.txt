Authors propose a competitive learning architecture that learn different RNN predictors independently, akin to a committee of experts which are chosen with a hard switch at run-time. This work is applied to the task of predictive different driving behaviors from human drivers, and combines behaviors at test time, often switching behaviors within seconds. Prediction loss is lower than the similar but non-competitive architecture used as a baseline.
It is not very clear how to interpret the results, what is the real impact of the model. If behaviors switch very often, can this really be seen as choosing the best driving mode for a given situation? Maybe the motivation needs to be rephrased a little to be more convincing?
The competitive approach presented is interesting but not really novel, thus the impact of this paper for a conference such as ICLR may be limited.
