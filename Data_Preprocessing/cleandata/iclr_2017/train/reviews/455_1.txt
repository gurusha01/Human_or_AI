This paper is a parallel work to Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching. The main solution of both papers is introducing autoencoder into discriminator to improve the stability and quality of GAN. Different to Denoising Feature Matching, EBGAN uses encoder-decoder instead of denoising only, and use hingle loss to replace original loss function.
The theoretical results are good, and empirical result of high resolution image is unique among all recent GAN advantages.
I suggest to introduce Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching as related work.
