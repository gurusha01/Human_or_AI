To train natural language systems by putting multiple agents within an interactive referential communication game is very nice. As the authors mention, there has been some (although seemingly not much) previous work on using multi-agent games to teach communication, and it certainly seems like a direction worth pursuing. Moreover, the approach of switching between these games and some supervised learning, as in the experiment described in Section 5 and suggested in Section 6, seems particularly fruitful. 
Note: For "clarity", I believe some of the network connections in Fig 1 have been omitted. However, given the rather highly-customized architecture and the slightly hard-to-follow description in Section 3, the shorthand diagram only adds to the confusion. The diagram probably needs to be fine-tuned, but at the very least (especially if I am misunderstanding it!), a caption must [still] be added to help the reader interpret the figure. 
Overall, the framework (Section 2) is great and seems quite effective/useful in various ways, the results are reasonable, and I expect there will be some interesting future variations on this work as well.
Caveat: While I am quite confident I understood the paper (as per confidence score below), I do not feel I am sufficiently familiar with the most closely related literature to accurately assess the place of this work within that context.
