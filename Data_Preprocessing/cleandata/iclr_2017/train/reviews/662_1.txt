The authors proposed a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) model that overcomes the rigid location-based memory access used in the original NTM model. The paper has two main contributions: 1) introducing a learnable addressing to NTM. 2) curriculum learning using hybrid discrete and continuous attention. The proposed model was empirically evaluated on Facebook bAbI task and has shown improvement over the original NTM.
Pros:
+ Comprehensive comparisons of feed-forward controllers v.s. recurrent controllers
+ Encouraging results on the curriculum learning on hybrid discrete and continuous attentions
Cons:
- Very weak NTM baseline (due to some hyper-parameter engineering?) in Table 1, 31% err. comparing to the NTM 20% err. reported in Table 1 in(Graves et al, 2016, Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory). In fact, the NTM baseline in (Graves et al 2016) is better than the proposed D-NTM with GRU controller. Maybe it is worthwhile to reproduce their results using the hyper-parameter setting in their Table2 which could potentially lead to better D-NTM performance?
- Section 3 of the paper is hard to follow. The overall clarity of the paper needs improvement.
