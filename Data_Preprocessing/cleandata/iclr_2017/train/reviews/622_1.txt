Authors' responses did not make me change my mind. I still think it is a clear rejection paper.
This paper shows how spin glass techniques that were introduced in Choromanska et al. to analyze surface loss of deep neural networks can be applied to deep residual networks. This is an interesting contribution but it seems to me that the results are too similar to the ones in Choromanska et al. and thus the novelty is seriously limited. Main theoretical techniques described in the paper were already introduced and main theoretical results mentioned there were in fact already proved. The authors also did not get rid of lots of assumptions from Choromanska et al. (path-independence, assumptions about weights distributions, etc.).
