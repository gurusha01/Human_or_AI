The paper proposes a low-rank version of pass-through networks to better control capacity, which can be useful in some cases, as shown in the experiments.
That said, I found the results not very convincing overall. Results are overall not as good as state-of-the-art on sequential MNIST or the memory task, but add one more hyper-parameter to tune. As I said, it would help to show in Tables and/or Figures competing approaches like uRNNs.
