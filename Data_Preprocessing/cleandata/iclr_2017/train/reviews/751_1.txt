This paper presents a heuristic for avoiding large negative rewards which have already been experienced by distilling such events into a "danger model". The paper is well written including some rather poetic language [*].
The heuristic is evaluated in two toy domains. I would think that in order to properly evaluate this one would use a well known benchmark e.g. Atari. Atari seems particularly apt since those games are full of catastrophes (i.e. sudden death).
[*] this reviewer's favourite quotes:
"Imagine a self-driving car that had to periodically hit a few pedestrians in order to remember that it's undesirable."
"The child can learn to adjust its behaviour without actually having to stab someone."
"... the catastrophe lurking just past the optimal shave."
