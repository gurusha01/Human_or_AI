The authors propose transfer learning variants for neural-net-based models, applied to a bunch of NLP tagging tasks.
The field of multi-tasking is huge, and the approaches proposed here do not seem to be very novel in terms of machine learning: parts of a general architecture for NLP are shared, the amount of shared "layers" being dependent of the task of interest.
The novelty lies in the type of architecture which is used in the particular setup of NLP tagging tasks.
The experimental results show that the approach seems to work well when there is not much labeled data available (Figure 2). Table 3 show some limited improvement at full scale.
Figure 2 results are debatable though: it seems the authors fixed the architecture size while varying the amount of labeled data; it is very likely that tuning the architecture for each size would have led to better results.
Overall, while the paper reads well, the novelty seems a bit limited and the experimental section seems a bit disappointing.
