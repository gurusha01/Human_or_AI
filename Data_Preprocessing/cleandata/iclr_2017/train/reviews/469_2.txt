The authors provide a well engineered solution to exploiting sparsity in convolutional layers of a deep network by recasting it as sparse matrix-vector multiplication. This leads to very nice speedups and the analysis of when this is possible is also useful for practitioners. My main concern with this paper is that the "research" aspect of it seems rather minimal, and it's mostly about performance engineering and comparisons. It is upto the area chairs to decide how well such a paper fits in at ICLR.
