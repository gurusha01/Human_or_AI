This paper propose a new evaluation metric for dialogue systems, and show it has a higher correlation with human annotation. I agree the MT based metrics like BLEU are too simple to capture enough semantic information, but the metric proposed in this paper seems to be too compliciated to explain.
On the other hand, we could also use equation 1 as a retrieval based dialogue system. So what is suggested in this paper is basically to train one dialogue model to evaluate another model. Then, the high-level question is why we should trust this model? This question is also relevant to the last item of my detail comments.
Detail comments:
- How to justify what is captured/evaluated by this metric? In terms of BLEU, we know it actually capture n-gram overlap. But for this model, I guess it is hard to say what is captured. If this is true, then it is also difficult to answer the question like: will the data dependence be a problem?
- why not build model incrementally? As shown in equation (1), this metric uses both context and reference to compute a score. Is it possible to show the score function using only reference? It will guarantee this metric use the same information source as BLEU or ROUGE. 
- Another question about equation (1), is it possible to design the metric to be a nonlinear function. Since from what I can tell, the comparison between BLEU (or ROUGE) and the new metric in Figure 3 is much like a comparison between the exponential scale and the linear scale.
- I found the two reasons in section 5.2 are not convincing if we put them together. Based on these two reasons, I would like to see the correlation with average score. A more reasonable way is to show the results both with and without averaging. 
- In table 6, it looks like the metric favors the short responses. If that is true, this metric basically does the opposite of BLEU, since BLEU will panelize short sentences. On the other hand, human annotators also tends to give short respones high scores, since long sentences will have a higher chance to contain some irrelevant words. Can we eliminate the length factor during the annotation? Otherwise, it is not surprise that the correlation.
