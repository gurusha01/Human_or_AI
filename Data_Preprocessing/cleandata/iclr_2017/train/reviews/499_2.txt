This paper proposes an interesting new method for training neural networks, i.e., a hypernetwork is used to generate the model parameters of the main network. The authors demonstrated that the total number of model parameters could be smaller while achieving competitive results on the image classification task. In particular, the hyperLSTM with non-shared weights can achieve excellent results compared to conventional LSTM and its variants on a couple of LM talks, which is very inspiring.    
--pros
This work demonstrates that it is possible to generate the neural network model parameters using another network that can achieve competitive results by a few relative large scale experiments. The idea itself is very inspiring, and the experiments are very solid.
--cons
The paper would be much stronger if it was more focused. In particular, it is unclear what is the key advantage of this hypernetwork approach. It is argued that in the paper that can achieve competitive results using smaller number of trainable model parameters. However, in the running time, the computational complexity is the same as the standard main network for static networks, such as ConvNet, and the computational cost is even larger for dynamic networks such as LSTMs. The improvements of hyperLSTMs over conventional LSTM and its variants seem mainly come from increasing the number of model parameters.
--minor question,
 The ConvNet and LSTM used in the experiments do not have a large softmax layer. For most of the word-level tasks for either LM or MT, the softmax layer could be more than 100K. Is it going to be challenging for the hyperNetwork generate large number of weights for that case, and is it going to slowing the training down significantly?
