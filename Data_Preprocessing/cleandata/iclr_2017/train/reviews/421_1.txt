This paper proposes a novel and interesting way to tackle the difficulties of performing inference atop HSMM. The idea of using an embedded bi-RNN to approximate the posterior is a reasonable and clever idea. 
That being said, I think two aspects may need further improvement:
(1) An explanation as to why a bi-RNN can provide more accurate approximations than other modeling choices (e.g. structured mean field that uses a sequential model to formulate the variational distribution) is needed. I think it would make the paper stronger if the authors can explain in an intuitive way why this modeling choice is better than some other natural choices (in addition to empirical verification).
(2) The real world datasets seem to be quite small (e.g. less than 100 sequences). Experimental results reported on larger datasets may also strengthen the paper.
