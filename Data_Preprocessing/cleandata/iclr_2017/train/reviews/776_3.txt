Disclosure: I am not an expert in machine translation algorithms.
Summary: A human translator does not come up with the final translation right
away. Instead, (s)he uses an iterative process, starting with a rough draft
which is corrected little by little. The idea behind this paper is to
implement a similar framework for an automated system. 
This paper is generally well written. 
It is my opinion however that drawings illustrating the architectures would help
understanding how the different algorithms relate to one another.
I like a lot that you report on a preliminary experiment to give an
intuition of how difficult the task is. You should highlight the links
between the task of finding the errors in a guess translation and the task
of iterative refinement. Could you use post-edited text to have a more
solid ground-truth?
My main concern with this paper is that in the experimental section the 
iterative approach tries to improve upon only one type of machine translation. 
Which immediately prompts these questions:
- why did they choose that approach to improve on?
- what is the part of the improvement that comes from the choice of the
  initial draft (maybe it was a very bad draft)? 
Here are some minor typos:
- p.2: ... a lookup table that replaceS each word... ?
- p.3: I might be mistanken but it seems to me that j is used for two
  different things. It is confusing.
- p.3: ...takes as input these representationS and outputs... ?
