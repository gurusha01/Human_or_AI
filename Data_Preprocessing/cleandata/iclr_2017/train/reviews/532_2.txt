Final review: The writers were very responsive and I agree the reviewer2 that their experimental setup is not wrong after all and increased the score by one.  But I still think there is lack of experiments and the results are not conclusive. As a reader I am interested in two things, either getting a new insight and understanding something better, or learn a method for a better performance. This paper falls in the category two, but fails to prove it with more throughout and rigorous experiments. In summary the paper lacks experiments and results are inconclusive and I do not believe the proposed method would be quite useful and hence not a conference level publication.

The paper proposes to train a policy network along the main network for selecting subset of data during training for achieving faster convergence with less data.
Pros:
It's well written and straightforward to follow
The algorithm has been explained clearly.
Cons:
Section 2 mentions that the validation accuracy is used as one of the feature vectors for training the NDF. This invalidates the experiments, as the training procedure is using some data from the validation set.
Only one dataset has been tested on. Papers such as this one that claim faster convergence rate should be tested on multiple datasets and network architectures to show consistency of results. Especially larger datasets as the proposed methods is going to use less training data at each iteration, it has to be shown in much larger scaler datasets such as Imagenet.
As discussed more in detail in the pre-reviews question, if the paper is claiming faster convergence then it has to compare the learning curves with other baselines such Adam. Plain SGD is very unfair comparison as it is almost never used in practice. And this is regardless of what is the black box optimizer they use. The case could be that Adam alone as black box optimizer works as well or better than Adam as black box + NDF.
