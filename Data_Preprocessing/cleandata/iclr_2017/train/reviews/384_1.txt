The paper looks at the problem of locating the answer to a question in a text (For this task the answer is always part of the input text). For this the paper proposes to combine two existing works: Match-LSTM to relate question and text representations and Pointer Net to predict the location of the answer in the text.
Strength:
-	The suggested approach makes sense for the task and achieves good performance, (although as the authors mention, recent concurrent works achieve better results)
-	The paper is evaluated on the SQuAD dataset and achieves significant improvements over prior work.
Weaknesses:
1.	It is unclear from the paper how well it is applicable to other problem scenarios where the answer is not a subset of the input text.
2.	Experimental evaluation
2.1.	It is not clear why the Bi-Ans-Ptr in Table 2 is not used for the ensemble although it achieves the best performance.
2.2.	It would be interested if this approach generalizes to other datasets.
Other (minor/discussion points)
-	The task and approach seem to have some similarity of locating queries in images and visual question answering. The authors might want to consider pointing to related works in this direction.
-	I am wondering how much this task can be seen as a "guided extractive summarization", i.e. where the question guides the summarization process.
-	Page 6, last paragraph: missing ".": "… searching This…"
Summary:
While the paper presents an interesting combination of two approaches for the task of answer extraction, the novelty is moderate. While the experimental results are encouraging, it remains unclear how well this approach generalizes to other scenarios as it seems a rather artificial task.
