The paper proposed a novel SampleRNN to directly model waveform signals and achieved better performance both in terms of objective test NLL and subjective A/B tests. 
As mentioned in the discussions, the current status of the paper lack plenty of details in describing their model. Hopefully, this will be addressed in the final version.
The authors attempted to compare with wavenet model, but they didn't manage to get a model better than the baseline LSTM-RNN, which makes all the comparisons to wavenets less convincing. Hence, instead of wasting time and space comparing to wavenet, detailing the proposed model would be better.
