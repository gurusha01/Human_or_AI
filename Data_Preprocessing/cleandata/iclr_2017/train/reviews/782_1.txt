This paper introduces a novel hierarchical memory architecture for neural networks, based on a binary tree with leaves corresponding to memory cells.  This allows for O(log n) memory access, and experiments additionally demonstrate ability to solve more challenging tasks such as sorting from pure input-output examples and dealing with longer sequences.
The idea of the paper is novel and well-presented, and the memory structure seems reasonable to have advantages in practice. However, the main weakness of the paper is the experiments. There is no experimental comparison with other external memory-based approaches (e.g. those discussed in Related Work), or experimental analysis of computational efficiency given overhead costs (beyond just computational complexity) despite that being one of the main advantages. Furthermore, the experimental setups are relatively weak, all on artificial tasks with moderate increases in sequence length.  Improving on these would greatly strengthen the paper, as the core idea is interesting.
