This paper presents an improved neural language models designed for selected long-term dependency, i.e., to predict more accurately the next identifier for the dynamic programming language such as Python. The improvements are obtained by:
1) replacing the fixed-widow attention with a pointer network, in which the memory only consists of context representation of the previous K identifies introduced for the entire history. 
2) a conventional neural LSTM-based language model is combined with such a sparse pointer network with a controller, which linearly combines the prediction of both components using a dynamic weights, decided by the input, hidden state, and the context representations at the time stamp.
Such a model avoids the the need of large window size of the attention to predict next identifier, which usually requires a long-term dependency in the programming language. This is partly validated by the python codebase (which is another contribution of this paper) experiments in the paper.
While the paper still misses some critical information that I would like to see, including how the sparse pointer network performance chances with different size of K, and how computationally efficient it is for both training and inference time compared to LSTM w/ attention of various window size, and ablation experiments about how much (1) and (2) contribute respectively, it might be of interest to the ICLR community to see it accepted.
