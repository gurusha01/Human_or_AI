This paper proposes a very simple idea (prune low-weight filters from ConvNets) in order to reduce FLOPs and memory consumption. The proposed method is experimented on with VGG-16 and ResNets on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.
Pros:
- Creates structured sparsity, which automatically improves performance without changing the underlying convolution implementation
- Very simple to implement
Cons:
- No evaluation of how pruning impacts transfer learning
I'm generally positive about this work. While the main idea is almost trivial, I am not aware of any other papers that propose exactly the same idea and show a good set of experimental results. Therefore I'm inclined to accept it. The only major downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning. For example, there is not much interest in the tasks of CIFAR10 or even ImageNet. Instead, the main interest in both academia and industry is the value of the learned representation for transferring to other tasks. One might expect filter pruning (or any other kind of pruning) to harm transfer learning. It's possible that the while the main task has about the same performance, transfer learning is strongly hurt. This paper has missed an opportunity to explore that direction.
Nit: Fig 2 title says VGG-16 in (b) and VGG_BN in (c). Are these the same models?
