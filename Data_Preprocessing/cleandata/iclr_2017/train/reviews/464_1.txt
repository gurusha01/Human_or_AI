I have not much to add to my pre-review comments.
It's a very well written paper with an interesting idea.
Lots of people currently want to combine RL with NLP. It is very en vogue.
Nobody has gotten that to work yet in any really groundbreaking or influential way that results in actually superior performance on any highly relevant or competitive NLP task.
Most people struggle with the fact that NLP requires very efficient methods on very large datasets and RL is super slow.
Hence, I believe this direction hasn't shown much promise yet and it's not yet clear it ever will due to the slowness of RL.
But many directions need to be explored and maybe eventually they will reach a point where they become relevant.
It is interesting to learn the obviously inherent grammatical structure in language though sadly again, the trees here do not yet capture much of what our intuitions are.
Regardless, it's an interesting exploration, worthy of being discussed at the conference.
