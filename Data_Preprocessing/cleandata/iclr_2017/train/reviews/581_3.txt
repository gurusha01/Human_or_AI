This paper takes a model based on that of Graves and retrofits it with a representation derived from the work of Plamondon. 
part of the goal of deep learning has been to avoid the use of hand-crafted features and have the network learn from raw feature representations, so this paper is somewhat against the grain. 
The paper relies on some qualitative examples as demonstration of the system, and doesn't seem to provide a strong motivation for there being any progress here. 
The paper does not provide true text-conditional handwriting synthesis as shown in Graves' original work. 
Be more consistent about your bibliography (e.g. variants of Plamondon's own name, use of "et al." in the bibliography etc.)
