My main objection with this work is that it operates under a hypothesis (that is becoming more and more popular in the literature) that all we need is to have gradients flow in order to solve long term dependency problems. The usual approach is then to enforce orthogonal matrices which (in absence of the nonlinearity) results in unitary jacobians, hence the gradients do not vanish and do not explode. However this hypothesis is taken for granted (and we don't know it is true yet) and instead of synthetic data, we do not have any empirical evidence that is strong enough to convince us the hypothesis is true. 
My own issues with this way of thinking is: a) what about representational power; restricting to orthogonal matrices it means we can not represent the same family of functions as before (e.g. we can't have complex attractors and so forth if we run the model forward without any inputs). You can only get those if you have eigenvalues larger than 1. It also becomes really hard to deal with noise (since you attempt to preserve every detail of the input, or rather every part of the input affects the output). Ideally you would want to preserve only what you need for the task given limited capacity. But you can't learn to do that. My issue is that everyone is focused on solving this preserved issue without worrying of the side-effects. 
I would like one of these papers going for jacobians having eigenvalues of 1 show this helps in realistic scenarios, on complex datasets.
