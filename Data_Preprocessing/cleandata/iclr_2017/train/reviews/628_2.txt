This paper is about submodular sum product networks applied to scene understanding. SPNs have shown great success in deep linear models since the work of Poon 2011.  The authors propose an extension to the initial SPNs model to be submodular, introducing submodular unary and pairwise potentials.  The authors propose a new inference algorithm. The authors evaluated their results on Stanford Background Dataset and compared against multiple baselines.
Pros:
+ New formulation of SPNs 
+ New inference algorithm
Cons:
- The authors did not discuss how the SSPN structure is learned and how the generative process chooses the a symbol (operation) at each level)
- The evaluations is lacking. The authors only showed results on their own approach and baselines, leaving out every other approach. Evaluations could have been also done on BSD for regular image segmentation (hierarchical segmentation). 
The idea is great, however, the paper needs more work to be published.  I would also recommend for the authors to include more details about their approach and present a full paper with extended experiments and full learning approach.
