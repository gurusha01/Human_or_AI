The authors investigate the neural GPU model introduced by Kaiser and Sutskever. In section 3 they claim its performance is due to the O(n^2) number of steps it can perform for each example. In the subsequent section they highlight the importance of curriculum training and empirically show that larger models generalize better. In section 5 they construct examples that reveal failure modes. In the last section they compare the performance given different input formats.
The paper is well written. It contains an exhaustive set of experiments which provide insight into the details of training the neural GPU model. It pushes the boundary of algorithms that can be learned further. On the other hand, the paper seems to lack a coherent message. It also fails to provide any insight into the how and why of the observations made (i.e. why curriculum training is essential and why certain failure modes exist).
The introduction contains several statements which should be qualified or explained further. As far as I am aware statistical learning theory does not guarantee that empirical risk minimization is consistent when the number of parameters is larger than the number of examples; the generalization performance depends on the VC dimension of the function space instead. Furthermore, the suggested link between adversarial examples and learning algorithms is tenuous, and references or a further explanation should be provided for the contentious statement that deep neural networks are able to match the performance of any parallel machine learning algorithm.
The authors argue that the neural GPU performs O(n^2) "steps" on each example, which allows it to learn algorithms with super-linear complexity such as multiplication. This analysis seems to overlook the parallel nature of the neural GPU architecture: Both addition and multiplication have O(log n) time complexity when parallelism is used (cf. a carry-lookahead adder and a Wallace tree respectively).
In section 4 the authors show that their larger models generalize better, which they argue is not self-evident. However, since both training and test error decrease it is likely that the smaller models are underfitting, in which case it is not counter-intuitive at all that a larger model would have better generalization error.
It is interesting to see that progressively decreasing the number of terms and increasing the radix of the number system works well as a learning curriculum, although it would be nice to have a stronger intuitive or theoretical justification for the latter.
The final section claims that neural GPUs are cellular automata. Further justification for this statement would be useful, since cellular automata are discrete models, and the equivalence between both models is in no way obvious. The relationship between global operations and changing the input format is circuitous.
In conclusion, the paper provides some useful insights into the neural GPU model, but does not introduce original extensions to the model and does not explain any fundamental limitations. Several statements require stronger substantiation.
