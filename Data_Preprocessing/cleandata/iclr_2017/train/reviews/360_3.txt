The paper proposes to study the problem of semi-supervised RL where one has to distinguish between labelled MDPs that provide rewards, and unlabelled MDPs that are not associated with any reward signal. The underlying is very simple since it aims at simultaneously learning a policy based on the REINFORCE+entropy regularization technique, and also a model of the reward that will be used (as in inverse reinforcement learning) as a feedback over unlabelled MDPs. The experiments are made on different continous domains and show interesting results
The paper is well written, and easy to understand. It is based on a simple but efficient idea of simultaneously learning the policy and a model of the reward and the resulting algorithm exhibit interesting properties. The proposed idea is quite obvious, but the authors are the first ones to propose to test such a model. The experiments could be made stronger by mixing continuous and discrete problems but are convincing.
