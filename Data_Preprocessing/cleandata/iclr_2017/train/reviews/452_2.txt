This paper provides a simple method to handle action repetitions. They make the action a tuple (a,x), where a is the action chosen, and x the number of repetitions. Overall they report some improvements over A3C/DDPG, dramatic in some games, moderate in other. The idea seems natural and there is a wealth of experiment to support it.
Comments:
- The scores reported on A3C in this paper and in the Mnih et al. publication (table S3) differ significantly. Where does this discrepancy come from? If it's from a different training regime (fewer iterations, for instance), did the authors confirm that running  their replication to the same settings as Mnih et al provide similar results?
- It is intriguing that the best results of FiGAR are reported on games where few actions repeat dominate. This seems to imply that for those, the performance overhead of FiGAR over A3C is high since A3C uses an action repeat of 4 (and therefore has 4 times fewer gradient updates). A3C could be run for a comparable computation cost with a lower action repeat, which would probably result in increased performance of A3C.  Nevertheless,  the automatic determination of the appropriate action repeat is interesting, even if the overall message seems to be to not repeat actions too often.
- Slightly problematic notation, where r sometimes denotes rewards, sometimes denotes elements of the repetition set R (top of page 5)
- In the equation at the bottom of page 5 - since the sum is not indexed over decision steps, not time steps, shouldn't the rewards r_k be modified to be the sum of rewards (appropriately discounted) between those time steps?
- The section on DDPG is confusingly written. "Concatenating" loss is a strange operation; doesn't FiGAR correspond to a loss to roughly looks like Q(x,mu(x)) + R log p(x) (with separate loss for learning the critic)? It feels that REINFORCE should be applied for the repetition variable x (second term of the sum) and reparametrization for the action a (first term)? 
- Is the 'namethisgame' name in the tables  intentional?
- A potential weakness of the method is that the agent must decide to commit to an action for a fixed number of steps, independently of what happens next. Have the authors considered a scheme in which, at each time step, the agent decides to stick with the current decision or not? (It feels like it might be a relatively simple modification of FiGAR).
