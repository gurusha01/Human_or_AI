The authors propose a method to generate adversarial examples w/o relying on knowledge of the network architecture or network gradients.
The idea has some merit, however, as mentioned by one of the reviewers, the field has been studied widely, including black box setups.
My main concern is that the first set of experiments allows images that are not in image space. The authors acknowledge this fact on page 7 in the first paragraph. In my opinion, this renders these experiments completely meaningless. At the very least, the outcome is not surprising to me at all.
The greedy search procedure remedies this issue. The description of the proposed method is somewhat convoluted. AFAICT, first a candidate set of pixels is generated by using PERT. Then the pixels are perturbed using CYCLIC.
It is not clear why this approach results in good/minimal perturbations as the candidate pixels are found using a large "p" that can result in images outside the image space. The choice of this method does not seem to be motivated by the authors.
In conclusion, while the authors to an interesting investigation and propose a method to generate adversarial images from a black-box network, the overall approach and conclusions seem relatively straight forward. The paper is verbosely written and I feel like the findings could be summarized much more succinctly.
