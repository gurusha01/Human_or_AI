This paper studies the graph embedding problem by using the encoder-decoder method. The experimental study on real network data sets show the features extracted by the proposed model is good for classification.
Strong points of this paper:
  1. The idea of using the methods from natural language processing to graph mining is quite interesting.
  2. The organization of the paper is clear
Weak points of this paper:
  1. Comparisons with state-of-art methods (Graph Kernels) is missing. 
  2. The problem is not well motivated, are there any application of this. What is the different from the graph kernel methods? The comparison with graph kernel is missing. 
  3. Need more experiment to demonstrate the power of their feature extraction methods. (Clustering, Search, Prediction etc.)
  4. Presentation of the paper is weak. There are lots of typos and unclear statements. 
  5. The author mentioned about the graph kernel things, but in the experiment they didn't compare them. Also, only compare the classification accuracy by using the proposed method is not enough.
