This paper is technically sound. It highlights well the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed simplified model.
In terms of impact, its novelty is limited, in the sense that the authors did seemingly the right thing and obtained the expected outcomes. The idea of modeling deep learning computation is not in itself particularly novel. As a companion paper to an open source release of the model, it would meet my bar of acceptance in the same vein as a paper describing a novel dataset, which might not provide groundbreaking insights, yet be generally useful to the community.
In the absence of released code, even if the authors promise to release it soon, I am more ambivalent, since that's where all the value lies. It would also be a different story if the authors had been able to use this framework to make novel architectural decisions that improved training scalability in some way, and incorporated such new insights in the paper.
UPDATED: code is now available. Revised review accordingly.
