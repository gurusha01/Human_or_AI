This paper tests zoneout against a variety of datasets - character level, word level, and pMNIST classification - showing applicability in a wide range of scenarios. While zoneout acts as a regularizer to prevent overfitting, it also has similarities to residual connections. The continued analysis of this aspect, including analyzing how the gradient flow improves the given tasks, is of great interest and helps show it as an inherent property of zoneout.
This is a well written paper with a variety of experiments that support the claims. I have also previously used this technique in a recurrent setting and am confident on the positive impact it can have upon tasks. This is likely to become a standard technique used within RNNs across various frameworks.
