This work is an extension of previous works on pointer models, that mixes its outputs with standard softmax outputs. 
The idea is appealing in general for context biasing and the specific approach appears quite simple.
The idea is novel to some extent, as previous paper had already tried to combine pointer-based and standard models,
but not as a mixture model, as in this paper.
The paper is clearly written and the results seem promising.
The new dataset the authors created (WikiText) also seems of high interest. 
A comment regarding notation:
The symbol pptr is used in two different ways in eq. 3 and eq. 5. : pptr(w) vs. pptr(yi|x_i) 
This is confusing as these are two different domains: for eq 3. the domain is a set of words and for eq. 5 the domain is a list of context words.
It would be helpful to use different symbol for the two objects.
