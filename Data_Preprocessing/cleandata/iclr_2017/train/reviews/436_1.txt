The paper presents an end-to-end neural network model for the problem of designing natural language interfaces for database queries. The proposed approach uses only weak supervision signals to learn the parameters of the model. Unlike in traditional approaches, where the problem is solved by semantically parsing a natural language query into logical forms and executing those logical forms over the given data base, the proposed approach trains a neural network in an end-to-end manner which goes directly from the natural language query to the final answer obtained by processing the data base. This is achieved by formulating a collection of operations to be performed over the data base as continuous operations, the distributions over which is learnt using the now-standard soft attention mechanisms. The model is validated on the smallish WikiTableQuestions dataset, where the authors show that a single model performs worse than the approach which uses the traditional Semantic Parsing technique. However an ensemble of 15 models (trained in a variety of ways) results in comparable performance to the state of the art. 
I feel that the paper proposes an interesting solution to the hard problem of learning natural language interfaces for data bases. The model is an extension of the previously proposed models of Neelakantan 2016. The experimental section is rather weak though. The authors only show their model work on a single smallish dataset. Would love to see more ablation studies of their model and comparison against fancier version of memnns (i do not buy their initial response to not testing against memory networks). 
I do have a few objections though. 
-- The details of the model are rather convoluted and the Section 2.1 is not very clearly written. In particular with the absence of the accompanying code the model will be super hard to replicate. I wish the authors do a better job in explaining the details as to how exactly the discrete operations are modeled, what is the role of the "row selector", the "scalar answer" and the "lookup answer" etc. 
-- The authors do a full attention over the entire database. Do they think this approach would scale when the data bases are huge (millions of rows)? Wish they experimented with larger datasets as well.
