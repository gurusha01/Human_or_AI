Authors present a parameterized variant of ELU and show that the proposed function helps to deal with vanishing gradients in deep networks in a way better than existing non-linearities. They present both a theoretical analysis and practical validation for presented approach. 
Interesting observations on statistics of the PELU parameters are reported. Perhaps explanation for the observed evolution of parameters can help better understand the non-linearity. It is hard to evaluate the experimental validation presented given the difference in number of parameters compared to other approaches.
