This paper presents a small trick to improve the model quality of variational autoencoders (further optimizing the ELBO while initializing it from the predictions of the q network, instead of just using those directly) and the idea of using Jacobian vectors to replace simple embeddings when interpreting variational autoencoders.
The idea of the Jacobian as a natural replacement for embeddings is interesting, as it does seem to cleanly generalize the notion of embeddings from linear models. It'd be interesting to see comparisons with other work seeking to provide context-specific embeddings, either by clustering or by smarter techniques (like Neelakantan et al, Efficient non-parametric estimation of multiple embeddings per word in vector space, or Chen et al A Unified Model for Word Sense Representation and Disambiguation). With the evidence provided in the experimental section of the paper it's hard to be convinced that the Jacobian of VAE-generated embeddings is substantially better at being context-sensitive than prior work.
Similarly, the idea of further optimizing the ELBO is interesting but not fully explored. It's unclear, for example, what is the tradeoff between the complexity of the q network and steps further optimizing the ELBO, in terms of compute versus accuracy.
Overall the ideas in this paper are good but I'd like to see them a little more fleshed out.
