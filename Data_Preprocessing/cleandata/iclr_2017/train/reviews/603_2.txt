Pros:
  using neural network on a new domain.
Cons:
  It is not clear how it is guaranteed that the network generates syntactically correct code.
Questions, comments:
  How is the NT2N+NTN2T top 5 accuracy is computed? Maximizing the multiplied posterior probability of the two classifications?
  Were all combinations of NT2N decision with all possible NTN2T considered?
  Using UNK is obvious and should be included from the very beginning in all models, since the authors selected the size of the
  lexicon, thus limited the possible predictions.
  The question should then more likely be what is the optimal value of alpha for UNK.
  See also my previous comment on estimating and using UNK.
  Section 5.5, second paragraph, compares numbers which are not comparable.
