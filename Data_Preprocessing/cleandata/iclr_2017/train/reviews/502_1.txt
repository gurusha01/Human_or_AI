This paper addresses the issue of how to evaluate automatic dialogue responses. This is an important issue because current practice to automatically evaluate (e.g. BLEU, based on N-gram overlap, etc.) is NOT correlated well with the desired quality (i.e. human annotation). The proposed approach is based on the use of an LSTM encoding of dialogue context, reference response and model response with appropriate scoring, with the essence of training one dialogue model to evaluate another model. However, the proposed solution depends on a reasonably good dialogue model to begin with, which is not guaranteed, rendering the new metric possibly meaningless.
