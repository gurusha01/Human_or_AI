The authors present a well thought out and constructed system for performing lipreading. The primary novelty is the end-to-end nature of the system for lipreading, with the sentence-level prediction also differentiating this with prior work. The described neural network architecture contains convolutional and recurrent layers with a CTC sequence loss at the end, and beam search decoding with an LM is done to obtain best results. Performance is evaluated on the GRID dataset, with some saliency map and confusion matrix analysis provided as well.
Overall, the work seems of high quality and clearly written with detailed explanations. The final results and analysis appear good as well. One gripe is that that the novelty lies in the choice of application domain as opposed to the methods. Lack of word-level comparisons also makes it difficult to determine the importance of using sentence-level information vs. choices in model architecture/decoding, and finally, the GRID dataset itself appears limited with the grammar and use of a n-gram dictionary. Clearly the system is well engineered and final results impress, though it's unclear how much broader insight the results yield.
