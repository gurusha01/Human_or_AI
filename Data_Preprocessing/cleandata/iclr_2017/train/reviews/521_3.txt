The authors advocate use of chirplets as a basis for modeling audio signals.  They introduce a fast chiplet transform for efficient computation. Also introduced is the idea of initializing (pre-training) CNN layers to mimic chirplet transform of audio signal (similar to ideas proposed by Mallet et al. on scattering transforms).  The paper is fairly easy to follow but in a few places contains undefined terms (e.g. AM-FM, MAP).
While the idea of using chirplet transform is interesting, my main concern is that the empirical evidence provided is in a rather narrow domain of bird call classification.  Furthermore, the accuracy gains shown in that domain are relatively small (61% MAP for log-Mel features vs 61.5% for chirplet transforms).  I would recommend that authors provide evidence for how this generalizes to other audio (including speech) tasks.
