This paper proposes a model for the task of argumentation mining (labeling the set of relationships between statements expressed as sentence-sized spans in a short text). The model combines a pointer network component that identifies links between statements and a classifier that predicts the roles of these statements. The resulting model works well: It outperforms strong baselines, even on datasets with fewer than 100 training examples.
I don't see any major technical issues with this paper, and the results are strong. I am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning. It focuses on ways to adapt reasonably mature techniques to a novel NLP problem. I think that one of the ACL conferences would be a better fit for this work.
The choice of a pointer network for this problem seems reasonable, though (as noted by other commenters) the paper does not make any substantial comparison with other possible ways of producing trees. The paper does a solid job at breaking down the results quantitatively, but I would appreciate some examples of model output and some qualitative error analysis.
Detail notes: 
- Figure 2 appears to have an error. You report that the decoder produces a distribution over input indices only, but you show an example of the network pointing to an output index in one case.
- I don't think "Wei12" is a name.
