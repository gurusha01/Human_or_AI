The paper presents an amortised MAP estimation method for SR problems. By learning a neural network which learns to project to an affine subspace of SR solutions which are consistent with the LR method the method enables finding propoer solutions with by using a variety of methods: GANs, noise assisted and density assisted optimisation.
Results are nicely demonstrated on several datasets.
I like the paper all in all, though I feel the writing can be polished by quite a bit and presentation should be made clearer. It was hard to follow at times and considering the subject matter is quite complicated making it clearer would help. Also, I would love to see some more analysis of the resulting the networks - what kind of features to they learn?
