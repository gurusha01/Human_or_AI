This paper describes a fast image semantic segmentation network.  Many different techniques are combined to create a system much faster than the baseline SegNet approach, with accuracy comparable or somewhat worse in most of three datasets evaluated.
The choices and techniques used to achieve these speed optimizations are enumerated and described along with intuitions behind them.  However, this section lacks measurements and experimental results showing the effects of these choices.  To me, that would have been a key component to the paper.  As it stands now, we only get to see final evaluation numbers, which appear to describe a speed/accuracy tradeoff with little insight into the pieces sum to get there.
In addition, I feel there could be a more thorough comparison with different existing systems.  Only SegNet is shown in comparison tables, even though many current systems are outlined in the related work.  Additional datasets such as Pascal or COCO may be interesting here as well, perhaps with a larger version of the ENet model.
The system looks to be fast, with decent accuracy on the majority of benchmarks described.  However, as a practical implementation paper, I feel it needs to more thoroughly demonstrate the effects of each component, as well as possibly some of the sizing/tuning, in order to provide a more robust picture.
