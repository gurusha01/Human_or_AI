I don't have much to add to my pre-review questions. The main thing I'd like to see that would strengthen my review further is a larger scale evaluation, more discussion of the hyperparameters, etc. Where test error are reported for snapshot ensembles it would be useful to report statistics about the performance of individual ensemble members for comparison (mean and standard deviation, maybe best single member's error rate).
