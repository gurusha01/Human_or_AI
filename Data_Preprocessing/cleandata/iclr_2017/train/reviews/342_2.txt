Update: I thank the authors for their comments! After reading them, I still think the paper is not novel enough so I'm leaving the rating untouched.
This paper proposes a domain adaptation technique for time series. The core of the approach is a combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation (at the last time step).
Pros:
1. The authors consider a very important application of domain adaptation.
2. The paper is well-written and relatively easy to read.
3. Solid empirical evaluation. The authors compare their method against several recent domain adaptation techniques on a number of datasets.
Cons:
1. The novelty of the approach is relatively low: it's just a straightforward fusion of the existing techniques.
2. The paper lacks any motivation for use of the particular combination (VRNN and RevGrad). I still believe comparable results can be obtained by polishing R-DANN (e.g. carefully penalizing domain discrepancy at every step)
Additional comments:
1. I'm not convinced by the discussion presented in Section 4.4. I don't think the visualization of firing patterns can be used to support the efficiency of the proposed method.
2. Figure 1(c) looks very suspicious. I can hardly believe t-SNE could produce this very regular structure for non-degenerate (non-synthetic, real-world) data.
Overall, it's a solid paper but I'm not sure if it is up to the ICLR standard.
