The work introduces a new regularization for learning domain-invariant representations with neural networks. The regularization aims at matching the higher order central moments of the hidden activations of the NNs of the source and target domain. The authors compared the proposed method vs MMD and two state-of-art NN domain adaptation algorithms on the Amazon review and office datasets, and showed comparable performance. 
The idea proposed is simple and straightforward, and the empirical results suggest that it is quite effective. The biggest limitation I can see with the proposed method is the assumption that the hidden activations are independently distributed. For example, this assumption will clearly be violated for the hidden activations of convolutional layers, where neighboring activations are dependent. I guess this is why the authors start with the output of dense layers for the image dataset. Do the authors have insight on if it is beneficial to start adaptation from lower level? If so, do the authors have insight on how to relax the assumption? In these scenarios, if MMD has an advantage as it does not make this assumption? 
Figure 3 does not seems to clearly support the boost of performance shown in table 2. The only class where the new regularization brings the source and target domain closer seem to be the mouse class pointed by the authors. Is the performance improvement only coming from this single class?
