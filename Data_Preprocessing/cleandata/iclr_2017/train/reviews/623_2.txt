The paper analyzes the properties of the Hessian of the training objective for various neural networks and data distributions. The authors study in particular, the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which relates to the difficulty and the local convexity of the optimization problem.
While there are several interesting insights discussed in this paper such as the local flatness of the objective function, as well as the study of the relation between data distribution and Hessian, a somewhat lacking aspect of the paper is that most described effects are presented as general, while tested only in a specific setting, without control experiments, or mathematical analysis.
For example, regarding the concentration of eigenvalues to zero in Figure 6, it is unclear whether the concentration effect is really caused by training (e.g. increasing insensitivity to local perturbations), or the consequence of a specific choice of scale for the initial parameters.
In Figure 8, the complexity of the data is not defined. It is not clear whether two fully overlapping distributions (the Hessian would then become zero?) is considered as complex or simple data.
Some of the plots legends (Fig. 1 and 2) and labels are unreadable in printed format. Plots of Figure 3 don't have the same range for the x-axis. The image of Hessian matrix of Figure 1 does not render properly in printed format.
