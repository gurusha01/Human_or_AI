I find the general direction of the work is promising but, in my opinion, the paper has three main drawback. While the motivation and overall idea seem very reasonable, the derivation is not convincing mathematically. The experiments are limited and the presentation needs significant improvement.  The writing and wording are in general poorly structured to the point that it is sometimes difficult to follow the proposed ideas. The overall organization needs improvement and the connection between sections is not properly established. The paper could be significantly improved by simply re-writing it.
I'm not fully convinced by the motivation for the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2), as described on page 5. The authors argue that  (Waldspurger, 2016) suggests that higher order nonlinearities might be  beneficial for sparsity. But unless I'm missing something, that work seems  to suggest that in the general case higher order nonlinearities can be neglected. Could you please comment on this?
On the other hand, adding a second order term to the descriptor seems
an interesting direction, as long as stability to small variations is preserved (which should be shown experimentally)
The experimental section is rather limited. The paper would be stronger with a thorough numerical evaluation. The presented results, in my opinion, do not show convincingly a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. In order to show the merits of the proposed approach, it would be really helpful to directly compare running times and compression rates.
Questions: 
- Can you show empirically that the proposed higher order nonlinearity
produces sparser representations than the complex modulus?
Other minor issues:
- The proof of Section 2.1, should be preceded by a clear statement in the form of a proposition
- "Hadamart" -> Hadamard
- "Valid set" -> Validation set
- "nonzeros coefficients" -> nonzero coefficients
- Figure 3 is difficult to understand. Please provide more details.
- Figure 5 is supposed to show a comparison to a standard implementation of the Scattering network, but it doesn't seem to be such comparison in that figure. Please explain.
- Please verify the references. The first reference states "MALLAT".
