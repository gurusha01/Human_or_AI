The paper extends a recently proposed video frame prediction method with reward prediction in order to learn the unknown system dynamics and reward structure of an environment. The method is tested on several Atari games and is able to predict the reward quite well within a range of about 50 steps. The paper is very well written, focussed and is quite clear about its contribution to the literature. The experiments and methods are sound. However, the results are not really surprising given that the system state and the reward are linked deterministically in Atari games. In other words, we can always decode the reward from a network that successfully encodes future system states in its latent representation. The contribution of the paper is therefore minor. The paper would be much stronger if the authors could include experiments on the two future work directions they suggest in the conclusions: augmenting training with artificial samples and adding Monte-Carlo tree search. The suggestions might decrease the number of real-world training samples and increase performance, both of which would be very interesting and impactful.
