This heuristic to improve gradient descent in image classification is simple and effective, but this looks to me more like a workshop track paper. Demonstration of the algorithm is limited to one task (CIFAR) and there is no theory to support it, so we do not know how it will generalize on other tasks
Working on DNNs for NLP, I find some observations in the paper opposite to my own experience. In particular, with architectures that combine a wide variety of layer types (embedding, RNN, CNN, gating), I found that ADAM-type techniques far outperform simple SGD with momentum, as they save searching for the right learning rate for each type of layer. But ADAM only works well combined with Poliak averaging, as it fluctuates a lot from one batch to another.
Revision:
-  the authors substantially improved the contents of the paper, including experiments on another set than Cifar
-  the workshop track has been modified to breakthrough work, so my recommendation for it is not longer appropriate
I have therefore improved my rating
