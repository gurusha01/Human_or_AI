The paper proposes a new neural architecture, called DRAGNN, for the transition-based framework. A DRAGNN uses TBRUs which are neural units to compute hidden activations for the current state of a transition-based system. The paper proves that DRAGNNs can cover a wide range of transition-based methods in the literature. In addition, one can easily implement multitask learning systems with DRAGNNs. The experimental results shows that using DRAGNNs the authors built (near) state-of-the-art systems for 2 tasks: parsing and summarization. 
The paper contains two major parts: DRAGNN and demonstrations of its usages. 
Regarding to the first part, the proposed DRAGNN is a neat tool for building any transition-based systems. However, it is difficult to say whether the DRAGNN is novel. Transition-based framework is already well defined and there's a huge trend in NLP using neural networks to implement transition-based systems. In my opinion, the difference between the Stack-LSTM (Dyer et al., 2015) and DRAGNN is slight. Of course, the DRAGNN is a powerful architecture but the contribution here should be considered mainly in terms of software engineering.
In the second part, the authors used DRAGNN to implement new transition-based systems for different (multi-)tasks. The implementations are neat, confirming that DRAGNN is a powerful architecture, especially for multitask learning. However, we should bear in mind that the solutions employed are already there in the literature, thus making difficult to judge the novelty of this part w.r.t. the theme of the conference.
