The authors propose a "hierarchical" attention model for video captioning.  They introduce a model composed of three parts: the temporal modeler (TEM) that takes as input the video sequence and outputs a sequential representation of the video to the HAM; the hierarchical attention/memory mechanism (HAM) implements a soft-attention mechanism over the sequential video representation; and finally a decoder that generates a caption. 
Related to the second series of questions above, it seems as though the authors have chosen to refer to their use of an LSTM (or equivalent RNN) as the output of the Bahdanau et al (2015) attention mechanism as a hierarchical memory mechanism. I am actually sympathetic to this terminology in the sense that the recent popularity of memory-based models seems to neglect the memory implicit in the LSTM state vector, but that said, this seems to seriously misrepresent the significance fo the contribution of this paper. 
I appreciate the ablation study presented in Table 1. Not enough researchers bother with this kind of analysis. But it does show that the value of the contributions is not actually clear. In particular the case for the TEM is quite weak.
Regarding the quantitative evaluation presented in Table 2, the authors are carving out a fairly specific set of features to describe the set of "fair" comparators from the literature. Given the variability of the models and alternate training datasets that are in use, I would find it more compelling if the authors just set about trying to achieve the best results they can, if that includes the fine-tuning of the frame model, so be it. The value of this work is as an application paper, so the discovery and incorporation of elements that can significantly improve performance would seems warranted. 
Overall, at this point, I do not see a sufficient contribution to warrant publication in ICLR.
