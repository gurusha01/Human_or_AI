The paper evaluates recent development in competitive ILSVRC CNN architectures from the perspective of resource utilization. It is clear that a lot of work has been put into the evaluations. The findings are well presented and the topic itself is important.
However, most of the results are not surprising to people working with CNNs on a regular basis. And even if they are, I am not convinced about their practical value. It is hard to tell what we actually learn from these findings when approaching new problems with computational constraints or when in production settings. In my opinion, this is mainly because the paper does not discuss realistic circumstances.
Main concerns:
1) The evaluation does not tell me much for realistic scenarios, that mostly involve fine-tuning networks, as ILSVRC is just a starting point in most cases. VGG for instance really shines for fine-tuning, but it is cumbersome to train from scratch. And VGG works well for compression, too. So possibly it is a very good choice if these by now standard steps are taken into account. Such questions are of high practical relevance!
2) Compressed networks have a much higher acc/parameter density, so comparison how well models can be compressed is important, or at least comparing to some of the most well-known and publicly available compressed networks.
3) There is no analysis on the actual topology of the networks and where the bottlenecks lie. This would be very useful to have as well.
Minor concern:
1) Why did the authors choose to use batch normalization in NiN and AlexNet?
