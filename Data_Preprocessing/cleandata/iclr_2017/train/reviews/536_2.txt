This work finds a connection between Bourgain's junta problem, the existing results in circuit complexity, and the approximation of a boolean function using two-layer neural net. I think that finding connections between different fields and applying the insights gained is a valid contribution. For this reason, I recommend acceptance.
But my current major concern is that this work is only constrained to the domain of boolean hypercube, which is far from what is done in practice (continuous domain). Indeed, the authors could argue that understanding the former is a first step, but if the connection is only suitable for this case and not adaptable to more general scenarios, then it probably would have limited interest.
