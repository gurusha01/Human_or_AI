A differentiable physics engine is indeed a wonderful thing to have. 
The key selling point of the proposed software is its speed, however there is no comparison to other physics engines. Besides describing the engine's speed in rather creative units (e.g. "model seconds per day"), the reader has no idea if this is fast or slow. Todorov's engine (my simulator of choice) computes a dynamics step and its derivatives wrt both states and controls (using finite-differences) in less than 1ms for a full humanoid model (his code is available here mujoco.org/book/programming.htmlsaDerivative). I think this actually faster than the engine described in this paper, but I can't be sure.
Because this engine is so limited in what it can collide (sphere/sphere and sphere/plane), it would be trivial to build the example models in several other popular engines (e.g. ODE, Bullet and MuJoCo) and simply compare the performance. Until this comparison is done I consider the paper to be incomplete.
