This paper proposed The Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) model for information fusion. The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of the unit using multiplicative gates. The paper collected a large genre dataset from IMDB and showed that GMU gets good performance.
The proposed approach seems quite interesting, and the audience may expect it can be used in general scenarios beyond movie genre prediction. So it is quite straightforward that the paper should test the algorithm in other applications, which was not done yet. That is the biggest shortcoming of this paper in my opinions.  
Another concern lies in how to evaluate the performance of information fusion. The abstract claims "The model improves the macro f-score performance of single-modality models by 30% and 4% with respect to visual and textual information respectively", however, such an improvement is off the key. If two modals are complementary to each other, the fusion results will always be higher. The key fact is how much better than baselines the proposed GMU is. There is a long list of techniques for fusions, so it is difficult to conduct an impressive comparison on only one real dataset. I think GMU did a nice work on movie dataset, but I would also expect other techniques, including fine-tuning, dropout, distillation may help too.  It would be nice if the author could compare these techniques. 
I also hope this paper could talk in more details the connection with mixture-of-expert (MoE) model. Both models are based on the nonlinear gated functions, while both method may suffer from local minimum for optimization on small datasets. I would like more in-depth discussion in their similarity and difference.
To gain more attention for GMU, I would encourage the author to open-source their code and try more datasets.
