This paper presents an attention based recurrent approach to one-shot learning. It reports quite strong experimental results (surpassing human performance/HBPL) on the Omniglot dataset, which is somewhat surprising because it seems to make use of very standard neural network machinery. The authors also note that other have helped verify the results (did Soumith Chintala reproduce the results?) and do provide source code.
After reading this paper, I'm left a little perplexed as to where the big performance improvements are coming from as it seems to share a lot of the same components of previous work. If the author's could report result from a broader suite of experiments like in previous work (e.g matching networks), it would much more convincing. An ablation study would also help with understanding why this model does so well.
