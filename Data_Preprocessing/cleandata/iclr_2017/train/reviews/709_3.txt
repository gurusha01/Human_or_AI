Authors propose the use of layer-wise language model-like pretraining for encoder-decoder models. This allows to leverage separate source and target corpora (in unsupervised manner) without necessity of large amounts of parallel training corpora. The idea is in principle fairly simple, and rely on initial optimising both encoder and decoder with LSTM tasked to perform language modelling. 
The ideas are not new, and the paper is more like a successful compilation of several approaches that have been around for some time. The experimental validation, though, offers some interesting insights into importance of initialization, and the effectiveness of different initialisations approaches in enc-dec setting.
The regulariser you propose to use on page 3, looks like typical multi-task objective function, especially it is used in an alternating manner would be interesting to see whether similar performance might have been obtained starting with this objective, from random initialisation.
You should probably give credit for encoder-decoder like-RNN models published in 1990s.
