This paper proposes a nonparametric neural network model, which automatically learns the size of the model during the training process. The key idea is to randomly add zero units and use sparse regularizer to automatically null out the weights that are irrelevant. The idea sounds to be a random search approach over discrete space with the help of sparse regularization to eliminate useless units. This is an important problem and the paper gives interesting results. My main comments are listed below:
What is the additional computation complexity of the algorithm? The decomposition of each fan-in weights into a parallel component and an orthogonal component and the transformation into radial-angular coordinates may require a lot of extra computation time. The authors may need to discuss the extra amount of operations relative to the parametric neural network. Furthermore, it would be useful to show some running time experiments.
It is observed that nonparametric networks return small networks on the convex dataset so that it is inferior to parametric networks. Any insight on this?
