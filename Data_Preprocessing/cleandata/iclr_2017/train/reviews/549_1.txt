The paper introduces an efficient variant of sparse coding and uses it as a building block in CNNs for image classification. The coding method incorporates both the input signal reconstruction objective as well as top down information from a class label. The proposed block is evaluated against the recently proposed CReLU activation block.
Positives:
The proposed method seems technically sound, and it introduces a new way to efficiently train a CNN layer-wise by combining reconstruction and discriminative objectives.
Negatives:
The performance gain (in terms of classification accuracy) over the previous state-of-the-art is not clear. Using only one dataset (CIFAR-10), the proposed method performs slightly better than the CRelu baseline, but the improvement is quite small (0.5% in the test set). 
The paper can be strengthened if the authors can demonstrate that the proposed method can be generally applicable to various CNN architectures and datasets with clear and consistent performance gains over strong CNN baselines. Without such results, the practical significance of this work seems unclear.
