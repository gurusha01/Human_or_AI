L-SR1 seems to have O(mn) time complexity. I miss this information in your paper. 
Your experimental results suggest that L-SR1 does not outperform Adadelta (I suppose the same for Adam). 
Given the time complexity of L-SR1, the x-axis showing time would suggest that L-SR1 is much (say, m times) slower. 
"The memory size of 2 had the lowest minimum test loss over 90" suggests that the main driven force of L-SR1 
was its momentum, i.e., the second-order information was rather useless.
