This paper presented a method of improving the efficiency of deep networks acting on a sequence of correlated inputs, by only performing the computations required to capture changes between adjacent inputs. The paper was clearly written, the approach is clever, and it's neat to see a practical algorithm driven by what is essentially a spiking network. The benefits of this approach are still more theoretical than practical -- it seems unlikely to be worthwhile to do this on current hardware. I strongly suspect that if deep networks were trained with an appropriate sparse slowness penalty, the reduction in computation would be much larger.
