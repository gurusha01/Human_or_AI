This paper proposes learning on the fly to represent a dialog as a graph (which acts as the memory), and is first demonstrated on the bAbI tasks. Graph learning is part of the inference process, though there is long term representation learning to learn graph transformation parameters and the encoding of sentences as input to the graph. This seems to be the first implementation of a differentiable memory as graph: it is much more complex than previous approaches like memory networks without significant gain in performance in bAbI tasks, but it is still very preliminary work, and the representation of memory as a graph seems much more powerful than a stack. Clarity is a major issue, but from an initial version that was constructive and better read by a computer than a human, the author proposed a hugely improved later version. This original, technically accurate (within what I understood) and thought provoking paper is worth publishing.
The preliminary results do not tell us yet if the highly complex graph-based differentiable memory has more learning or generalization capacity than other approaches. The performance on the bAbI task is comparable to the best memory networks, but still worse than more traditional rule induction (see
