The authors proposed an way to measure the generation of out-of-distribution novelty. Their methods implied, if a model trained on MNIST digits could generate some samples are more like letters judged by anther model trained both on MNIST and letters,  the model trained on MNIST could be seen as having  the ability to generate novel samples. Some empirical experiments were reported. 
The novelty is hard to define. The proposed metric is also problematic. A naive combination of MNIST and letters dataset do not represent the natural distribution of handwritten digits and letters. IT means that the model trained on the combination could not properly distinguished digits and letters. The proposed out-of-class count and out-of-class max are thus pointless. For the "novel" samples in Fig. 3,  they are clearly digits. I guess they quantize the samples to binary. If they would quantize the samples to 8 bit, the resulting images would look even more like digits.
