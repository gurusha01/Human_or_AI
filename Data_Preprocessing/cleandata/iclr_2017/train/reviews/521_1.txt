While I understand the difficulty of collecting audio data from animals, I think this type of feature engineering does not go in the right direction. I would rather see a model than learns the feature representation from data.  I would think it should be possible to collect a more substantial corpus in zoos / nature etc, and then train a generative model. The underlying learned feature representation could be then used to feed a classifier. I'm not familiar with the particularities of this task, it's hard to judge the improvements by using chirplets.
