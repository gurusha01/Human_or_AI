This paper addresses the problem of the influence of mini-batch size on the SGD convergence in a general non-convex setting. The results are then translated to analyze the influence of the number of learners on ASGD. I find the problem addressed in the paper relevant and the theoretical part clearly written. The experimental evaluation is somehow limited though. I would like to see experiments on more data sets and more architectures, as well as richer evaluation, e.g. N=16 is a fairly small experiment. It would also enhance the paper if the experiments were showing a similar behavior of other popular methods like momentum SGD or maybe EASGD (the latter in distributed setting). I understand the last evaluation does not directly lie in the scope of the paper, though adding these few experiments do not require much additional work and should be done.
