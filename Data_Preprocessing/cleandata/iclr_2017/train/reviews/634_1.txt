This paper proposes the Layerwise Origin Target Synthesis (LOTS) method, which entails computing a difference in representation at a given layer in a neural network and then projecting that difference back to input space using backprop. Two types of differences are explored: linear scalings of a single input's representation and difference vectors between representations of two inputs, where the inputs are of different classes.
In the former case, the LOTS method is used as a visualization of the representation of a specific input example, showing what it would mean, in input space, for the feature representation to be supressed or magnified. While it's an interesting computation to perform, the value of the visualizations is not very clear.
In the latter case, LOTS is used to generate adversarial examples, moving from an origin image just far enough toward a target image to cause the classification to flip. As expected, the changes required are smaller when LOTS targets a higher layer (in the limit of targetting the last layer, results similar to the original adversarial image results would be obtained).
The paper is an interesting basic exploration and would probably be a great workshop paper. However, the results are probably not quite compelling enough to warrant a full ICLR paper.
A few suggestions for improvement:
 - Several times it is claimed that LOTS can be used as a method for mining for diverse adversarial examples that could be used in training classifiers more robust to adversarial perturbation. But this simple experiment of training on LOTS generated examples isn't tried. Showing whether the LOTS method outperforms, say, FGS would go a long way toward making a strong paper.
 - How many layers are in the networks used in the paper, and what is their internal structure? This isn't stated anywhere. I was left wondering whether, say, in Fig 2 the CONV21 layer was immediately after the CONV11 layer and whether the FC8 layer was the last layer in the network.
 - In Fig 1, 2, 3, and 4, results of the application of LOTS are shown for many intermediate layers but miss for some reason applying it to the input (data) layer and the output/classification (softmax) layer. Showing the full range of possible results would reinforce the interpreatation (for example, in Fig 3, are even larger perturbations necessary in pixel space vs CONV1 space? And does operating directly in softmax space result in smaller perturbations than IP2?)
 - The PASS score is mentioned a couple times but never explained at all. E.g. Fig 1 makes use of it but does not specify such basics as whether higher or lower PASS scores are associated with more or less severe perturbations. A basic explanation would be great.
 - 4.2 states "In summary, the visualized internal feature representations of the origin suggest that lower convolutional layers of the VGG Face model have managed to learn and capture features that provide semantically meaningful and interpretable representations to human observers." I don't see that this follows from any results. If this is an important claim to the paper, it should be backed up by additional arguments or results.
1/19/17 UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL:
Given that experiments were added to the latest version of the paper, I'm increasing my review from 5 -> 6. I think the paper is now just on the accept side of the threshold.
