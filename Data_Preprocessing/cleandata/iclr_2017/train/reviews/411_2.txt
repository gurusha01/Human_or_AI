This is an interesting and pleasant paper on superoptimization, that extends the  problem approached by the stochastic search STOKE to a learned stochastic search, where the STOKE proposals are the output of a neural network which takes some program embedding as an input. The authors then use REINFORCE to learn an MCMC scheme with the objective of minimizing the final program cost.
The writing is clear and results highlight the efficacy of the method.
comments / questions:
- Am I correct in understanding that of the entire stochastic computation graph, only the features->proposal part is learned. The rest is still effectively the stoke MCMC scheme? Does that imply that the 'uniform' model is effectively Stoke and is your baseline (this should probably be made explicit )
- Did the authors consider learning the features instead of using out of the box features (could be difficult given the relatively small amount of data - the feature extractor might not generalize).
- In a different context, 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference:Bridging the Gap' by Salimans et al. suggests considering a MCMC scheme as a stochastic computation graph and optimizing using a variational (i.e. RL) criterion. The problem is different, it uses HMC instead of MCMC, but it might be worth citing as a similar approach to 'meta-optimized' MCMC algorithms.
