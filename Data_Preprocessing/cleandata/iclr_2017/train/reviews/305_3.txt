This is a nice paper that demonstrates an end-to-end trained image compression and decompression system, which achieves better bit-rate vs quality trade-offs than established image compression algorithms (like JPEG-2000). In addition to showing the efficacy of 'deep learning' for a new application, a key contribution of the paper is the introduction of a differentiable version of "rate" function, which the authors show can be used for effective training with different rate-distortion trade-offs. I expect this will have impact beyond the compression application itself---for other tasks that might benefit from differentiable approximations to similar functions.
The authors provided a thoughtful response to my pre-review question. I would still argue that to minimize distortion under a fixed range and quantization, a sufficiently complex network would learn automatically produce  codes within a fixed range with the highest-possible entropy (i.e., it would meet the upper bound). But the second argument is convincing---doing so forces a specific "form" on how the compressor output is used, which to match the effective compression of the current system, would require a more complex network that is able to carry out the computations currently being done by a separate variable rate encoder used to store q.
