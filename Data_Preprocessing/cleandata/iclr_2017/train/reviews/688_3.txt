The paper presents an interesting modification to PoWER algorithm that is well motivated. The main limitation of this paper is the lack of comparison with other methods and on richer problems. The experiments haven't given confidence to show its claimed benefits, generality and scalability over prior methods. Giving this confidence doesn't necessarily require running your method on all large-scale domains or doing exhaustic hyper-parameter search, but for example it could go beyond current domains. Cartpole only optimizes 5 parameters. Ad targeting task lacks comparison with alternative methods. Since this method is built on PoWER and closely connected with RWR, it is likely there are limits to performance which may become apparent when the method is tried on other domains and with other benchmark methods, e.g. even standard ones like importance sampling-based off-policy learning is known to suffer in high-dimensional or continuous action space; limits of RWR/PoWER-like methods based on their connection with entropy-regularized RL.
