This paper investigates the identity parametrization also known as shortcuts where the output of each layer has the form h(x)+x instead of h(x). This has been shown to perform well in practice (eg. ResNet). The discussions and experiments in the paper are interesting. Here's a few comments on the paper:
-Section 2: Studying the linear networks is interesting by itself. However, it is not clear that how this could translate to any insight about non-linear networks. For example, you have proved that every critical point is global minimum. I think it is helpful to add some discussion about the relationship between linear and non-linear networks.
-Section 3: The construction is interesting but the expressive power of residual network is within a constant factor of general feedforward networks and I don't see why we need a different proof given all the results on finite sample expressivity of feedforward networks. I appreciate if you clarify this.
-Section 4: I like the experiments. The choice of random projection on the top layer is brilliant. However, since you have combined this choice with all-convolutional residual networks, it is hard for the reader to separate the affect of each of them. Therefore, I suggest reporting the numbers for all-convolutional residual networks with learned top layer and also ResNet with random projection on the top layer.
Minor comments:
1- I don't agree that Batch Normalization can be reduced to identity transformation and I don't know if bringing that in the abstract without proper discussion is a good idea.
