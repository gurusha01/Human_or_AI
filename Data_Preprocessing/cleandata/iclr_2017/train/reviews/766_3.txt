The authors apply the commonly used Fast RCNN detection system to pedestrian detection. They use "EdgeBoxes" object proposals and incorporate batch norm into their network. Results are shown on the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets. They are reasonable but not state-of-the-art. Results are not shown on Caltech Pedestrians, the standard modern dataset used to evaluate pedestrian detection. Perhaps more importantly, the paper has no novelty.
The detection system described in this paper is a standard application of Fast RCNN to pedestrian detection. The implementation is not state-of-the-art, and there is no novelty in this work. EdgeBoxes has been used with Fast RCNN before. The authors don't seem to be aware of more recent developments in object detection, including Faster RCNN (
