The paper's aim is - as argued in the paper and the responses to other reviewers comments - that SPN and MPN can be interpreted as encoders and decoders of RL. Well - this is an interesting perspective and could be (potentially) worth a paper. 
However
- the current draft is far from being convincing in that respect - and I am talking about the updated / improved version as of now. The paper does not require minor revisions to make this point apparent - but a significant and major rewrite which seems beyond what the authors have done so far. 
- the experiments are (as also pointed out by other reviewers) rather unstructured and difficult to see much of an insight. I should probably also list (as the other other reviewers) flaws and issues with the experiments - but given the detailed comments by the other reviewers there seems to be little additional value in doing so
So in essence the paper simply does not deliver at this point on its promise (as far as I am concerned) and in that sense I suggest a very clear reject for this conference. 
As for the dataset employed: MNIST should be considered a toy-dataset for pretty much all purposes these days - and in that sense the dataset choice is not helping me (and many other people that you might want to convince) to safe this paper.
