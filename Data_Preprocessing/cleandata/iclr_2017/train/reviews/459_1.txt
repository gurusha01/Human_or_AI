The paper proposed a nice framework leveraging Tucker and Tensor train low-rank tensor factorization to induce parameter sharing for multi-task learning.
The framework is nice and appealing. 
However, MTL is a very well studied problem and the paper considers simple task for different classification, and it is not clear if we really need ``Deep Learning" for these simple datasets. A comparison with existing shallow MTL is necessary to show the benefits of the proposed methods (and in particular being deep) on the dataset. The authors ignore them on the basis of speculation and it is not clear if the proposed framework is really superior to simple regularizations like the nuclear norm. The idea of nuclear norm regularization can also be extended to deep learning as gradient descent are popular in all methods.
