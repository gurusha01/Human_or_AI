This paper present an experimental study of the robustness of state-of-the-art CNNs to different types of "attacks" in the context of image classication. Specifically, an attack aims to fool the classification system with a specially corrupted image, i.e. making it misclassify the image as (1) any wrong class (non-targeted attack) or (2) a target class, chosen in advance by the attacker (targeted attack). For instance, the attacker could corrupt an image of an ostrich in such a way that it would be classified as a megalith. Even though the attacker's agenda is not so clear in this example, it is still interesting to study the weaknesses of current systems in view of (1) improving them in general and (2) actual risks with e.g. autonomous vehicles.
The paper is mostly experimental. In short, it compares different strategies (already published in previous papers) for all popular networks  (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50/101/152) and the two aforementionned types of attacks. The experiments are well conducted and clearly exposed. A convincing point is that attacks are also conducted on "clarifai.com" which is a black-box classification system. Some analysis and insightful explanations are also provided to help understanding why CNNs are prone to such attacks (Section 6).
To sum up, the main findings are that non-targeted attacks are easy to perform, even on a black-box system. Non-targeted attacks are more difficult to realize with existing schemes, but the authors propose a new approach for that that vastly improves over existing attacks (even though it's still far from perfect: ~20% success rate on clarifai.com versus 2% with previous schemes).
Arguably, The paper still has some weaknesses:
 - The authors are treating the 3 ResNet-based networks as different, yet they are obviously clearly correlated. See Table 7 for instance. This is naturally expected because their architecture is similar (only their depth varies). Hence, it does not sound very fair to state that "One interesting finding is that [...] the first misclassified label (non-targeted) is the same for all models except VGG-16 and GoogLeNet.", i.e., the three ResNet-based networks.
 - A subjective measure is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks on the black box system. While this is for a good reason (clarifai.com returns image labels that are different from ImageNet), it is not certain that the reported numbers are fair (even though the qualitative results look convincing).
 - The novelty of the proposed approach (optimizing an ensemble of network instead of a single network) is limited. However, this was not really the point of the paper, and it is effective, so it seems ok overall.
 - The paper is quite long. This is expected because it is an extensive evaluation study, but still. I suggest the authors prune some near-duplicate content (e.g. Section 2.3 has a high overlap with Section 1, etc.).
 - The paper would benefit from additional discussions with the recent and related work of Fawzi et al (NIPS'16) in Section 6. Indeed the work of Fawzi et al. is mostly theoretical and well aligned with the experimental findings and observations (in particular in Section 6).
To conclude, I think that this paper is somewhat useful for the community and could help to further improve existing architectures, as well as better assess their flaws and weaknesses.
In equation (7), why did you use f(x) rather than J(x)? Because f(x) = argmax J(x), f(x) is highly non-linear, so the gradient descent might be much more inefficient. Even tough optimizing with J rather than f is not exactly the same objective, the outcome may be very similar. Did you try this, or di I misunderstood something?
