This works applies steerable frames for various tasks where convolutional neural networks with location invariant operators are traditionally applied. Authors provide a detailed overview of steerable frames followed with an experimental section which applies dynamic steerable network to small machine learning problems where the steerability is conceptually useful.
Even though the evaluation is performed only on few small tasks, the reason why more tasks were not evaluated is that piece-wise pose invariance is needed only for a subset of tasks. The fact, that simply using overcomplete bases as a sort of "feature pre-processing" improves the results for already highly optimized ResNet and DenseNet architectures is quite interesting achievement.
For the edge detection, a relatively hard baseline is selected - the Dynamic Filter Networks, which already attempts to achieve position invariant filters. The fact that DSFN improves the performance on this task verifies that regressing the parametrization of the steerable filters yields better results than regressing the filters directly.
In the last experiment authors apply the network to video classification using LSTMs and they show that the improved performance is not due to increased capacity of the network.
In general, it is quite interesting work. Even though it does not offer ground-breaking results (mainly in a sense of not performing experiments on larger tasks), it is theoretically interesting and shows promising results.
There are few minor issues and suggestions related to the paper:
* For the LSTM experiment, in order to be more exact, it would be useful to include information about total number of parameters, as the network which estimates the pose also increases the number of parameters.
* Would it be possible to provide more details about how the back-propagation is done through the steerable filters?
* For the Edge Detection experiment, it would be useful to provide results for some standard baseline - e.g. CNN with a similar number of parameters. Simply to see how useful it is to have location-variant filters for this task.
* The last sentence in second paragraph on page 1 is missing a verb. Also it is maybe unnecessary.
* The hyphenation for ConvNet is incorrect on multiple places (probably `\hyphenation{Conv-Net}` would fix it).
