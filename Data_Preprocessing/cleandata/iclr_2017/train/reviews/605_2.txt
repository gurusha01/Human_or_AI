The authors propose a variational autoencoder for a specific form of tree-generating model.
The generative model for trees seems reasonable but is not fully motivated. If no previous references suggest this tree specification, then clear motivation for e.g. the extension beyond CFG should be given beyond the one sentence provided.
Given the tree model it may be natural to specify a tree model encoder, but the posterior distribution does not respect the structure of the prior (as the posterior distribution couples tree-distant variables), so there is in fact no good reason for this form, and a more general network could be compared with.
The approach provides sensible differentiable functions for encoding the network. The tests are indicative, but the results are very similar to the tested approaches, and it is not clear what the best evaluation metric ought to be.
Significance: the work may well be significant in the future, but is currently somewhat preliminary, lacks motivation, chooses a tree structured encoder without particular motivation, and is lacking in wider comparisons. There is also some lack of current motivation for the model, and no comparison with tractable models that do not need a variational autoencoder.
Originality: original, but at the moment it is not clear such originality is necessary.
Clarity: Good.
Experiments: Sensible, but not extensive or conclusive.
