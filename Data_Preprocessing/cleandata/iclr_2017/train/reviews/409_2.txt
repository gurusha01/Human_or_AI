This paper describes the creation of a corpus of freely-licensed classical music recordings along with corresponding MIDI-scores aligned to the audio.  It also describes experiments in polyphonic transcription using various deep learning approaches, which show promising results.
The paper is a little disorganised and somewhat contradictory in parts. For example, I find the first sentence in section 2 (MusicNet) would better be pushed one paragraph below so that the section be allowed to begin with a survey of the tools available to researchers in music. Also, the description for Table 3 should probably appear somewhere in the Methods section. Last example: the abstract/intro says the purpose is note prediction; later (4th paragraph of intro) there's a claim that the focus is "learning low-level features of music...." I find this slightly disorienting.
Although others (Uehara et al., 2016, for example) have discussed collection platforms and corpora, this work is interesting because of its size and the approach for generating features. I'm interested in what the authors will to do expand the offerings in the corpus, both in terms of volume and diversity.
