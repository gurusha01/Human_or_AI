Sincere apologies for the late review.
This paper argues to approach Super-Resolution as amortised MAP estimation. A projection step to keep consistent HR-LR dependencies is proposed and experimentally verified to obtain better results throughout. Further three different methods to solve the resulting cross-entropy problem in Eq.9 are proposed and tested. 
Summary: Very good paper, very well written and presented. Experimental results are sufficient, the paper presents well chosen toy examples and real world applications. From my understanding the contributions for the field of super-resolutions are novel (3.2,3.3,3.4), parts that are specific for the training of GANs may have appeared in different variants elsewhere (see also discussion). I believe that this paper will be relevant to future work on super-resolution, the finding that GAN based model training yields most visually appealing results suggests further work in this domain. 
Manuscript should be proof-read once more, there were some very few typos that may be worth fixing.
