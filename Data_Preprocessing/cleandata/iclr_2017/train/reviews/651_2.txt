The method proposed essential trains neural networks without a traditional nonlinearity, using multiplicative gating by the CDF of a Gaussian evaluated at the preactivation; this is motivated as a relaxation of a probit-Bernoulli stochastic gate. Experiments are performed with both.
The work is somewhat novel and interesting. Little is said about why this is preferable to other similar parameterizations of the same (sigmoidal? softsign? etc.) It would be stronger with more empirical interrogation of why this works and exploration of the nearby conceptual space. The CIFAR results look okay by today's standards but the MNIST results are quite bad, neural nets were doing better than 1.5% a decade ago and the SOI map results (and the ReLU baseline) are above 2%. (TIMIT results on frame classification also aren't that interesting without evaluating word error rate within a speech pipeline, but this is a minor point.)
The idea put forth that SOI map networks without additional nonlinearities are comparable to linear functions is rather misleading as they are, in expectation, nonlinear functions of their input. Varying an input example by multiplying or adding a constant will not be linearly reflected in the expected output of the network. In this sense they are more nonlinear than ReLU networks which are at least locally linear.
