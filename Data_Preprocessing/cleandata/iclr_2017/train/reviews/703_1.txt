The authors present TARTAN, a derivative of the previously published DNN accelerator architecture: "DaDianNao". The key difference is that TARTAN's compute units are bit-serial and unroll MAC operation over several cycles. This enables the units to better exploit any reduction in precision of the input activations for improvement in performance and energy efficiency.
Comments:
1. I second the earlier review requesting the authors to be present more details on the methodology used for estimating energy numbers for TARTAN. It is claimed that TARTAN gives only a 17% improvement in energy efficiency. However, I suspect that this small improvement is clearly within the margin of error ij energy estimation.  
2. TARTAN is a derivative of DaDianNao, and it heavily relies the overall architecture of DaDianNao. The only novel aspect of this contribution is the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit, which (unfortunately) turns out to incur a severe area overhead (of nearly 3x over DaDianNao's compute units).
3. Nonetheless, the idea of bit-serial computation is certainly quite interesting. I am of the opinion that it would be better appreciated (and perhaps be even more relevant) in a circuit design / architecture focused venue.
