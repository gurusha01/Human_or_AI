The authors are trying to understand whether static analysis can be learned. As I hinted in my question, I think that all of the interesting complexity of static analysis has been removed in the toy language --- extraordinarily simple logic using a set can solve the problem posed, and an LSTM (unsurprisingly) can learn the extraordinarily simple logic (when given a differentiable set object). This extreme simplicity gives me no confidence that a more realistic static analysis problem can be solved.
LSTMs (and deep learning) have had remarkable successes in solving messy real-world language problems. It's certainly possible that LSTMs could solve static analysis -- but being technically timid is not the right way to go about it.
