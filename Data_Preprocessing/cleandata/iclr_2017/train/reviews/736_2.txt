Update: I thank the authors for their comments. I still think that the method needs more experimental evaluation: for now, it's restricted to the settings in which one can use pre-trained ImageNet model, but it's also important to show the effectiveness in scenarios where one needs to train everything from scratch. I would love to see a fair comparison of the state-of-the-art methods on toy datasets (e.g. see (Bousmalis et al., 2016), (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015)). In my opinion, it's a crucial point that doesn't allow me to increase the rating.
This paper proposes a simple trick turning batch normalization into a domain adaptation technique. The authors show that per-batch means and variances normally computed as a part of the BN procedure are sufficient to discriminate the domain. This observation leads to an idea that adaptation for the target domain can be performed by replacing population statistics computed on the source dataset by the corresponding statistics from the target dataset.
Overall, I think the paper is more suitable for a workshop track rather than for the main conference track. My main concerns are the following:
1. Although the main idea is very simple, it feels like the paper is composed in such a way to make the main contribution less obvious (e.g. the idea could have been described in the abstract but the authors avoided doing so). 
2. (This one is from the pre-review questions) The authors are using much stronger base CNN which may account for the bulk of the reported improvement. In order to prove the effectiveness of the trick, the authors would need to conduct a fair comparison against competing methods. It would be highly desirable to conduct this comparison also in the case of a model trained from scratch (as opposed to reusing ImageNet-trained networks).
