This is the most convincing paper on image compression with deep neural networks that I have read so far. The paper is very well written, the use of the rate-distortion theory in the objective fits smoothly in the framework. The paper is compared to a reasonable baseline (JPEG2000, as opposed to previous papers only considering JPEG). I would expect this paper to have a very good impact. 
Yes, please include results on Lena/Barbara/Baboon (sorry, not Gibbons), along with state-of-the-art references with more classical methods such as the one I mentioned in my questions. I think it is important to clearly state how NN compare to best previous methods. From the submitted version, I still don't know how both categories of methods are positioned.
