The paper conducts a detailed evaluation of different CNN architectures applied to image retrieval. The authors focus on testing various architectural choices, but do not propose or compare to end-to-end learning frameworks.
Technically, the contribution is clear, particularly with the promised clarifications on how multiple scales are handled in the representation. However, I am still not entirely clear whether there would be a difference in the multi-scale settting for full and cropped queries.
While the paper focuses on comparing different baseline architectures for CNN-based image retrieval, several recent papers have proposed to learn end-to-end representations specific for this task, with very good result (see for instance the recent work by Gordo et al. "End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"). The authors clarify that their work is orthogonal to papers such as Gordo et al. as they assess instead the performance of networks pre-trained from image classification. In fact, they also indicate that image retrieval is more difficult than image classification -- this is because it is performed by using features originally trained for classification. I can partially accept this argument. However, given the results in recent papers, it is clear than end-to-end training is far superior in practice and it is not clear the analysis developed by the authors in this work would transfer or be useful for that case as well.
