The paper proposes to use the representation learning approach of [Jonschkowski & Brock, 2015] with a deep network as function approximator. The general task and approach are interesting, but contribution of this work is limited, and experimental evaluation is absolutely unsatisfactory, so the paper cannot be accepted for publications. 
The approach is tested on a simple synthetic task with very small training and test sets and very little variation in the data. The authors admitted themselves that the results are preliminary. The proposed method is not compared with existing approaches or simple hand-crafted baselines. It is impossible to judge if the proposed method is useful and/or performs well compared to existing approaches. This makes the paper unfit for publication. 
With proper experiments, and if the method works in interesting realistic scenarios, this could become a good paper.
