A well written paper and an interesting construction - I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. 
I found the formalism a bit hard to follow without specific examples- that is, it wasn't clear to me at first what the specific components in figure 1A were. What constitutes the controller, a control, the optimizer, what was being optimized, etc., in specific cases. Algorithm boxes may have been helpful, especially in the case of your experiments. A description of existing models that fall under your conceptual framework might help as well.
In Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms, Snoek, Larochelle and Adams propose optimizing with respect to expected improvement per second to balance computation cost and performance loss. It might be interesting to see how this falls into your framework.
Experimental results were presented clearly and well illustrated the usefulness of the metacontroller. I'm curious to see the results of using more metaexperts.
