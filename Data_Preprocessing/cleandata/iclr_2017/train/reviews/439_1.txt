This is a good paper, well written, that presents a simple but effective approach to predict code properties from input output pairs. 
The experiments show superiority to the baseline, with speedup factors between one to two orders of magnitude. This is a solid gain!
The domain of programs is limited, so there is more work to do in trying such ideas on more difficult tasks. Using neural nets to augment the search is a good starting point and a right approach, instead of generating full complex code.
I see this paper as being above the threshold for acceptance.
