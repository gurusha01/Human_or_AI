The paper presents an interesting and very detailed study of targeted and non-targeted adversarial examples in CNNs.
I'm on the fence about this paper but am leaning towards acceptance. Such detailed empirical explorations are difficult and time-consuming to construct yet can serve as important stepping stones for future work. I see the length of the paper as a strength since it allows for a very in-depth look into the effectiveness and transferability of different kinds of adversarial examples.  
There are, however, some concerns:
1) While the length of the paper is a strength in my mind, the key contributions should be made much more clear. As evidenced by my comment earlier, I got confused at some point between the ensemble/non-ensemble method, and about the contribution of the Clarifai evaluation and what I should be focusing on where. I'd strongly suggest a radical revision which more clearly focuses the story: 
- First, we demonstrate that non-targeted attacks are easy while targeted attacks are hard (evidenced by a key experiment comparing the two; we refer to appendix or later sections for the extensive exploration of e.g., current Section 3)
- Thus, we propose an ensemble method that is able to handle targeted attacks much better (evidenced by experiments focusing on the comparison between ensemble and non-ensemble method, both in a controlled setting and on Clarifai)
- Also, here are all the other details and explorations. 
2) Instead of using ResNet-152, Res-Net-101 and ResNet-50 as three of the five models, it would've been better to use one ResNet architecture and the other two, say, AlexNet and Network-in-Network. This would make the ensemble results a lot more compelling.
