The paper proposes an alternative to conditional max. log likelihood for training discriminative classifiers. The argument is that the conditional log. likelihood is an upper bound of the Bayes error which becomes lousy during training. The paper then proposes better bounds computed and optimized in an iterative algorithm. Extensions of this idea are developed for regularized losses and a weak form of policy learning. Tests are performed on different datasets.
An interesting aspect of the contribution is to revisit a well-accepted methodology for training classifiers. The idea looks fine and some of the results seem to validate it. This is however still a preliminary work and one would like to see the ideas pushed further. Globally, the paper lacks coherence and depth: the part on policy learning is not well connected to the rest of the paper and the link with RL is not motivated in the two examples (ROC optimization and uncertainties). The experimental part needs a rewriting, e.g. I did not find a legend for identifying the different curves in the figures, which makes difficult to appreciate the results.
