First I would like to apologize for the delay in reviewing.
Summary : In this paper a variational inference is adapted to deep generative models, showing improvement for non-negative sparse dataset. The authors offer as well a method to interpret the data through the model parameters.
The writing is generally clear. The methods seem correct. The introspection approach appears to be original. I found very interesting the experiment on the polysemic word embedding. I would however have like to see how the obtained embedding would perform with respect to other more common embeddings in solving a supervised task.
Minor :
Eq. 2: too many closing parentheses
