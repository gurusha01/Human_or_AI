Combining storage and processing capabilities is an interesting research topic because data transfer is a major issue for many machine learning tasks.
The paper itself is well-written, but unfortunately addresses a lot of things only to medium depth (probably due length constraints).
My opinion is that a journal with an in-depth discussion of the technical details would be a better target for this paper.
Even though the researchers took an interesting approach to evaluate the performance of the system, it's difficult for me to grasp the expected practical improvements of this approach.
With such a big focus on GPU (and more specialized hardware such as TPUs), the one question that comes to mind: By how much does this - or do you expect it to - beat the latest and greatest GPU on a real task?
I don't consider myself an expert on this topic even though I have some experience with SystemC.
