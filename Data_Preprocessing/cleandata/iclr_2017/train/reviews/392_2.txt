This paper proposes an autoencoder approach to lossy image compression by minimizing the weighted sum of reconstruction error and code length. The architecture consists of a convolutional encoder and a sub-pixel convolutional decoder. Experiments compare PSNR, SSIM, and MS-SSIM performance against JPEG, JPEG-2000, and a recent RNN-based compression approach. A mean opinion score test was also conducted.
Pros:
+ The paper is clear and well-written.
+ The decoder architecture takes advantage of recent advances in convolutional approaches to image super-resolution.
+ The proposed approaches to quantization and rate estimation are sensible and well-justified.
Cons:
- The experimental baselines do not appear to be entirely complete.
The task of using autoencoders to perform compression is important and has a large practical impact. Though directly optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff is not an entirely novel enterprise, there are enough differences (e.g. the quantization approach and sub-pixel convolutional decoder) to sufficiently distinguish this from earlier work. I am not an image compression expert but the approach and results both seem compelling. The main shortcoming is that the implementation of Toderici et al. 2016b appears to be incomplete, and there is no comparison to Balle et al. 2016. Overall, I feel that the fact that this architecture achieves competitive performance with JPEG-2000 while simultaneously setting the stage for future work that varies the encoder/decoder size and data domain means the community will find this work to be of significant interest.
I have no further specific comments at this time as they were answered sufficiently in the pre-review questions.
