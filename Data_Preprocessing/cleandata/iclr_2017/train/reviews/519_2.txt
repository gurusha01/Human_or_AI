I think this build upon previous works, in the attempt of doing something similar to batch norm specific for RNNs. To me the experiments are not yet very convincing, I think is not clear this works better than e.g. Layer Norm or not significantly so. I'm not convinced on how significant the speed up is either, I can appreciate is faster, but it doesn't feel like order of magnitude faster. The theoretical analysis also doesn't provide any new insights. 
All in all I think is good incremental work, but maybe is not yet significant enough for ICLR.
