This paper is well written, and well presented. This method is using denoise autoencoder to learn an implicit probability distribution helps reduce training difficulty, which is neat. In my view, joint training with an auto-encoder is providing extra auxiliary gradient information to improve generator. Providing auxiliary information may be a methodology to improve GAN.
