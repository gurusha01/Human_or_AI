The paper presents an on-policy method to predict future intrinsic measurements. All the experiments are performed in the game of Doom (vizDoom to be exact), and instead of just predicting win/loss or the number of frags (score), the authors trained their model to predict (a sequence of) triplets of (health, ammunition, frags), weighted by (a sequence of) "goal" triplets that they provided as input. Changing the weights of the goal triplet is a way to perform/guide exploration. At test time, one can act by maximizing the long term goal only.
The results are impressive, as this model won the 2016 vizDoom competition. The experimental section of the paper seems sound:
 - There are comparisons of DFP with A3C, DQN, and an attempt to compare with DSR (a recent similar approach from Kulkarni et al., 2016). DFP outperforms other approaches (or equal them when they reach a ceiling / optimum, as for A3C in scenario D1).
 - There is an ablation study that supports the thesis that all the "added complexity" of the paper's model is useful.
Predicting intrinsic motivation (Singh et al. 2004), auxiliary variables, and forward modelling, are well-studied domains of reinforcement learning. The version that I read (December 4th revision) adequately references prior work, even if it is not completely exhaustive. 
A few comments (nitpicks) on the form:
 - Doom is described as a 3D environment, whereas it is actually a 2D environment (the height is not a discriminative/actionable dimension) presented in (fake) 3D.
 - The use of "P" in (2) (and subsequently) may be misleading as it stands for prediction but not probability (as is normally the case for P).
 - The double use of "j" (admittedly, with different fonts) in (6) may be misleading.
 - Results tables could repeat the units of the measurements (in particular as they are heterogenous in Table 1).
I think that this paper is a clear accept. One could argue that experiments could be conducted on different environments or that the novelty is limited, but I feel that "correct" (no-nonsense, experimentally sound on Doom, appendix providing details for reproducibility) and "milestone" (vizDoom winner) papers should get published.
