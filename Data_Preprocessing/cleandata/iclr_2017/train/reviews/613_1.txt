This paper proposes to use a causality score to weight a sparsity regularizer.  In that way, selected variables trade off between being causal and discriminative.  The framework is primarily evaluated on a proprietary health dataset.  While the dataset does give a good motivation to the problem setting, the paper falls a bit short for ICLR due to the lack of additional controlled experiments, relatively straightforward methodology (given the approach of Chalupka et al., arXiv Preprint, 2016, which is a more interesting paper from a technical perspective), and paucity of theoretical motivation.
At the core of this paper, the approach is effectively to weight a sparsity regularizer so that "causal" variables (as determined by a separate objective) are more likely to be selected.  This is generally a good idea, but we do not get a proper validation of this from the experiments as ground truth is absent.  A theorem on identifiability of causal+discriminative variables from a data sample combined with adequate synthetic experiments would have probably been sufficient, for example, to push the paper towards accept from a technical perspective, but as it is, it is lacking in insight and reproducibility.
