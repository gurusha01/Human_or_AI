This paper proposes a new neural network model for sentence representation. This new model is inspired by the success of residual network in Computer Vision and some observation of word morphology in Natural Language Processing. Although this paper shows that this new model could give the best results on several datasets, it lacks a strong evidence/intuition/motivation to support the network architecture.
To be specific:
- I was confused by the contribution of this paper: character-aware word embedding or residual network or both?
- The claim of using residual network in section 3.3 seems pretty thin, since it ignores some fundamental difference between image representation and sentence representation. Even though the results show that adding residual network could help, I was still not be convinced. Is there any explanation about what is captured in the residual component from the perspective of sentence modeling?
- This paper combines several components in the classification framework, including character-aware model for word embedding, residual network and attention weight in Type 1 feature. I would like to see the contribution from each of them to the final performance, while in Table 3 I only saw one of them. Is it possible to add more results on the ablation test?
- In equation (5), what is the meaning of $i$ in $G_i$?
- The citation format is impropriate
