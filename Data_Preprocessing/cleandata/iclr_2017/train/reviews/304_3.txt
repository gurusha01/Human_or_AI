This paper improves significantly upon the original NPI work, showing that the model generalizes far better when trained on traces in recursive form. The authors show better sample complexity and generalization results for addition and bubblesort programs, and add two new and more interesting tasks - topological sort and quicksort (added based on reviewer discussion). Furthermore, they actually prove that the algorithms learned by the model generalize perfectly, which to my knowledge is the first time this has been done in neural program induction.
