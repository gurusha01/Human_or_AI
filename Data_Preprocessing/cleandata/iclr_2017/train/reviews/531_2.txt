This paper presents an approach to modeling videos based on a decomposition into a background + 2d sprites with a latent hidden state. The exposition is OK, and I think the approach is sensible, but the main issue with this paper is that it is lacking experiments on non-synthetic datasets. As such, while I find the graphics inspired questions the paper is investigating interesting, I don't think it is clear that this work introduces useful machinery for modeling more general videos.
I think this paper is more appropriate as a workshop contribution in its current form.
