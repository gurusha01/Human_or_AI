The work proposes to use the geometry of data (that is considered to be known a priori) in order to have more consistent sparse coding. Namely, two data samples that are similar or neighbours, should have a sparse code that is similar (in terms of support). The general idea is not unique, but it is an interesting one (if one admits that the adjacency matrix A is known a priori), and the novelty mostly lies on the definition of the regularisation term that is an l1-norm (while other techniques would mostly use l2 regularisation).
Based on this idea, the authors develop a new SRSC algorithm, which is analysed in detail and shown to perform better than its competitors based on l2 sparse coding regularisation and other schemes in terms of clustering performance.
Inspired by LISTA, the authors then propose an approximate solution to the SRSC problem, called Deep-SRSC, that acts as a sort of fast encoder. Here too, the idea is interesting and seems to be quite efficient from experiments on USPS data, even if the framework seems to be strongly inspired from LISTA. That scheme should however be better motivated, by the limitations of SRSC that should be presented more clearly. 
Overall, the paper is well written, and pretty complete. It is not extremely original in its main ideas though, but the actual algorithm and implementation seem new and effective.
