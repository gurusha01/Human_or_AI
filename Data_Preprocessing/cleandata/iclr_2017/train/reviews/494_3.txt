The authors describe a dataset of proof steps in higher order logic derived from a set of proven theorems. The success of methods like AlphaGo suggests that for hard combinatorial style problems, having a curated set of expert data (in this case the sequence of subproofs) is a good launching point for possibly super-human performance. Super-human ATPs are clearly extremely valuable. Although relatively smaller than the original Go datasets, this dataset seems to be a great first step. Unfortunately, the ATP and HOL aspect of this work is not my area of expertise. I can't comment on the quality of this aspect.
It would be great to see future work scale up the baselines and integrate the networks into state of the art ATPs. The capacity of deep learning methods to scale and take advantage of larger datasets means there's a possibility of an iterative approach to improving ATPs: as the ATPs get stronger they may generate more data in the form of new theorems. This may be a long way off, but the possibility is exciting.
