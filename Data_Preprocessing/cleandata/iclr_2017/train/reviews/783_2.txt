This paper proposed a synchronous parallel SGD by employing several backup machines. The parameter server does not have to wait for the return from all machines to perform the update on the model, which reduce the synchronization overhead. It sounds like a reasonable and straightforward idea. 
My main concern is that this approach is only suitable for some very specific scenario, that is, most learners (except a small number of learners) are at the same pace to return the results. If the efficiency of learners does not follow such distribution, I do not think that the proposed algorithm will work. So I suggest two revisions:
- provide more experiments to show the performance with different efficiency distributions of learners.
- assuming that all learners follow the same distribution of efficiency and show the expected idle time is minor by using the proposed algorithm.
