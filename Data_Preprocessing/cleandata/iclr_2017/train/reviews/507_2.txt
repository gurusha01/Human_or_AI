This paper describes a new benchmark for word representations: spotting the "odd one out". The authors build upon an idea recently presented at the RepEval workshop, but are able to collect a significantly larger amount of examples by relying on existing ontologies.
Although the innovation is relatively incremental, it is an important step in defining challenging benchmarks for general-purpose word representations. While humans are able to perform this task almost flawlessly (given adequate domain knowledge), the experiments in this paper show that current embeddings fall short. The technical contribution is thorough; the dataset construction appears logical, and the correlation analysis is convincing. I would like to see it accepted at ICLR.
