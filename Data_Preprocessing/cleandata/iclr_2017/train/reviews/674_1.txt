The paper proposes to provide a theoretical explanation for why deep convolutional neural networks are invertible (at-least, when going back from certain intermediate layers to the image itself). It does so by considering the invertibility of a single layer, assuming the convolutional filters essentially correspond to incoherent measurements satisfying RIP.
In my opinion, while this is an interesting direction of research, the paper is not ready for publication. I feel the treatment does not go sufficiently towards explaining the phenomenon in deep neural networks. Even after reading the response from the authors, I feel the results are only a minor variation of the standard results from compressive sensing for sparse reconstruction with incoherent measurements.
A deep neural network is fundamentally different from a single layer---it is the "deep" part that makes the forward task work. As the authors note, there is significant deterioration when IHT is applied recursively----therefore, at best the theory explains the partial invertibility of a single layer. That a single layer is approximately invertible isn't surprising, that a cascade of layers is.
For any theoretical analysis of this phenomenon to be useful, I believe it must go beyond analyzing a single compressive measurement-type layer, and try to explain how much of the same theory holds for a cascade. I say this because it's entirely possible that the sparse recovery theory breaks down beyond a single layer, and invertibility ends up being a property caused by correlations between the weights of different layers. In other words, there is no way to tell from the current results for individual layers whether they are in fact a step towards explaining the invertibility of whole networks.
