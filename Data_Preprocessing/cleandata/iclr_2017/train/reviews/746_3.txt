I find this paper extremely hard to read. The main promise of the paper is to train models for combinatorial search procedures, especially for dynamic programming to learn where to split and merge. The present methodology is supposed to make use of some form of scale invariance property which is scarcely motivated for most problems this approach should be relevant for. However, the general research direction is fruitful and important.
The paper would be much more readable if it would start with a clear, formal problem formulation, followed by some schematic view on the overall flow and description on which parts are supervised, which parts are not. Also a tabular form and sample of the various kinds problems solved by this method could be listed in the beginning as a motivation with some clear description on how they fit the central paradigm and motivate the rest of the paper in a more concrete manner.
Instead, the paper is quite chaotic, switching between low-level and high level details, problem formulations and their solutions in a somewhat random, hard to parse order.
Both split and merge phases seem to make a lot of discrete choices in a hierarchical manner during training. The paper does not explain how those discrete choices are backpropagated through the network in an unbiased manner, if that is the case at all.
In general, the direction this paper is exciting, but the paper itself is a frustrating read in its present form. I have spent several hours on it without having to manage to achieve a clear mental image on how all the presented pieces fit together. I would revise my score if the paper would be improved greatly from a readability perspective, but I think it would require a major rewrite.
