This is high novelty work, and an enjoyable read.
My concerns about the paper more or less mirror my pre-review questions. I certainly agree that the learned variable computation mechanism is obviously doing something interesting. The empirical results really need to be grounded with respect to the state of the art, and LSTMs are still an elephant in the room. (Note that I do not consider beating LSTMs, GRUs, or any method in particular as a prerequisite for acceptance, but the comparison nevertheless should be made.)
In pre-review responses the authors brought up that LSTMs perform more computation per timestep than Elman networks, and while that is true, this is an axis along which they can be compared, this factor controlled for (at least in expectation, by varying the number of LSTM cells), etc. A brief discussion of the proposed gating mechanism in light of the currently popular ones would strengthen the presentation.
