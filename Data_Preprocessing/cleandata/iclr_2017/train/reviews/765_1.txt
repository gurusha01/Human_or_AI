This paper introduces an additional reward-predicting head to an existing NN architecture for video frame prediction. In Atari game playing scenarios, the authors show that this model can successfully predict both reward and next frames.
Pros:
- Paper is well written and easy to follow.
- Model is clear to understand.
Cons:
- The model is incrementally different than the baseline. The authors state that their purpose is to establish a pre-condition, which they achieve. But this makes the paper quite limited in scope.
This paper reads like the start of a really good long paper, or a good short paper. Following through on the future work proposed by the authors would make a great paper. As it stands, the paper is a bit thin on new contributions.
