this paper proposes a model for representing unseen words in a neural language model. the proposed model achieves poor results in LM and a slight improvement over a baseline model. 
this work needs a more comprehensive analysis:
- there's no comparison with related work trying to address the same problem
- an intrinsic evaluation and investigation of why/how their work should be better are missing.
- to make a bolder claim, more investigation should be done with other morphologically rich languages. Especially for MT, in addition to going from En-> LanguageX, MRLX -> En or MRLX -> MRLY should be done.
