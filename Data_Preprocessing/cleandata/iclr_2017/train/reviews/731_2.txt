This paper presents a method to represent text documents and paragraphs as short binary codes to allow fast similarity search and retrieval by using hashing techniques. The real-valued paragraph vectors by Le & Mikolov is extended by adding a stochastic binary layer on top of the neural network architecture. Two methods for binarizing the final activations are compared: (1) simply adding noise to sigmoid activations to encourage discritization. (2) binarizing the activations in the forward pass and keeping them real-valued in the backward pass (straight-through estimation). The paper presents encouraging results by using straight-through estimation on 20 newsgroup and RCV1 text datasets by using 128 and 32 bit binary codes.
On the plus side, the application presented in the paper is interesting and important. The exposition of the paper is clean and clear. However, the novelty of the approach is limited from a machine learning standpoint. The literature on binary hashing beyond semantic hashing and Krizhevsky's binary autoencoders in 2011 is not explained. An important baseline is missing where real-valued paragraph vectors are learned first, and then converted to binary codes using off-the-shelf hashing methods (e.g. random projection LSH by Charikar, BRE by Kulis & Darrell, ITQ by Gong & Lazebnik, MLH by Norouzi & Fleet, etc.)
Given the lack of novelty and the missing baseline, I do not recommend this paper in its current for publication in the ICLR conference's proceeding. Moving forward, this paper may be more suitable for NLP conferences as it is more on the applied side.
More comments:
- I believe from an practical perspective it may be easier to first learn real-valued paragraph vectors and then quantize them for indexing. That said, an end-to-end approach as proposed in this paper may perform better. I would like to see an empirical comparison between the proposed end-to-end approach and a simpler two stage quantization method suggested here.

- The paper argues that the length of binary codes cannot be longer than 32 bits because longer codes are not suitable for document hashing. This is not quite right given multi-probe hashing mechanisms, for example see "Mult-index Hashing" by Norouzi et al.
- See "Hashing for Similarity Search: A Survey" by Wang et al. for a survey of related work on binary hashing and quantization. You seem to ignore the extensive work done on binary hashing.
