The authors attempt to extract analytical equations governing physical systems from observations - an important task. Being able to capture succinct and interpretable rules which a physical system follows is of great importance. However, the authors do this with simple and naive tools which will not scale to complex tasks, offering no new insights or advances to the field. 
The contribution of the paper (and the first four pages of the submission!) can be summarised in one sentence: 
"Learn the weights of a small network with cosine, sinusoid, and input elements products activation functions s.t. the weights are sparse (L1)".
The learnt network weights with its fixed structure are then presented as the learnt equation. 
This research uses tools from literature from the '90s (I haven't seen the abbreviation ANN (page 3) for a long time) and does not build on modern techniques which have advanced a lot since then. I would encourage the authors to review modern literature and continue working on this important task.
