This paper presents a novel way of pruning filters from convolutional neural networks with a strong theoretical justification. The proposed methods is derived from the first order Taylor expansion of the loss change while pruning a particular unit. This leads to simple weighting of the unit activation with its gradient w.r.t. loss function and performs better than simply using the activation magnitude as the heuristic for pruning. This intuitively makes sense, as we would like to remove not only the filters with low activation, but also filters where the incorrect activation value would not have small influence on the target loss.
Authors thoroughly investigate multiple baselines, including an oracle which sets an upper bound on the target performance even though it is computationally expensive. The devised method seems to be quite elegant and authors show that it generalizes well on multiple tasks and is computationally more than feasible as it is easy to combine with traditional fine tuning procedure. Also, the work clearly shows the trade-offs of increased speed and decreased performance, which is useful for practical applications.
It would be also useful to compare against different baselines, e.g. [1]. However this method seems to be more useful as it does not involve training of a new network (and thus is probably much faster).
Suggestion - maybe it can be extended in the future towards also removing only parts of the filters(e.g. for the 3D convolution)? This may be more complicated as it would need to change the implementation of convolution operator, but can lead to further speedup.
