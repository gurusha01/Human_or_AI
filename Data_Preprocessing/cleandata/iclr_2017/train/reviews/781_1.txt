The paper addresses the problem of learning compact binary data representations. I have a hard time understanding the setting and the writing of the paper is not making it any easier. For example I can't find a simple explanation of the problem and I am not familiar with these line of research. I read all the responses provided by authors to reviewer's questions and re-read the paper again and I still do not fully understand the setting and thus can't really evaluate the contributions of these work. The related work section does not exist and instead the analysis of the literature is somehow scattered across the paper. There are no derivations provided. Statements often miss references, e.g. the ones in the fourth paragraph of Section 3. This makes me conclude that the paper still requires significant work before it can be published.
