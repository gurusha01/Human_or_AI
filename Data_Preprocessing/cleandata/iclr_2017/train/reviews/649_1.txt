This paper analyzes dependency trees vs standard window contexts for word vector learning.
While that's a good goal I believe the paper falls short of a thorough analysis of the subject matter.
It does not analyze Glove like objective functions which often work better than the algorithms used here.
It doesn't compare in absolute terms to other published vectors or models.
It fails to gain any particularly interesting insights that will modify other people's work.
It fails to push the state of the art or make available new resources for people.
