This paper presents a set of experiments investigating what kinds of information are captured in common unsupervised approaches to sentence representation learning. The results are non-trivial and somewhat surprising. For example, they show that it is possible to reconstruct word order from bag of words representations, and they show that LSTM sentence autoencoders encode interpretable features even for randomly permuted nonsense sentences.
Effective unsupervised sentence representation learning is an important and largely unsolved problem in NLP, and this kind of work seems like it should be straightforwardly helpful towards that end. In addition, the experimental paradigm presented here is likely more broadly applicable to a range of representation learning systems. Some of the results seem somewhat strange, but I see no major technical concerns, and think that that they are informative. I recommend acceptance.
One minor red flag: 
- The massive drop in CBOW performance in Figures 1b and 4b are not explained, and seem implausible enough to warrant serious further investigation. Can you be absolutely certain that those results would appear with a different codebase and different random seed implementing the same model? Fortunately, this point is largely orthogonal to the major results of the paper.
Two writing comments:
- I agree that the results with word order and CBOW are surprising, but I think it's slightly misleading to say that CBOW is predictive of word order. It doesn't represent word order at all, but it's possible to probabilistically reconstruct word order from the information that it does encode.
- Saying that "LSTM auto-encoders are more effective at encoding word order than word content" doesn't really make sense. These two quantities aren't comparable.
