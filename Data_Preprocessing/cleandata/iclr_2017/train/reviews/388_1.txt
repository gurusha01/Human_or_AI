Paper Summary: 
The paper introduces a question answering model called Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN). It extracts co-dependent representations of the document and question, and then uses an iterative dynamic pointing decoder to predict an answer span. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all published models.
Paper Strengths: 
-- The proposed model introduces two new concepts to QA models -- 1) using attention in both directions, and 2) a dynamic decoder which iterates over multiple answer spans until convergence or maximum number of iterations.
-- The paper also presents ablation study of the proposed model which shows the importance of their design choices.
-- It is interesting to see the same idea of co-attention performing well in 2 different domains -- Visual Question Answering and machine reading comprehension.
-- The performance breakdown over document and question lengths (Figure 6) strengthens the importance of attention for QA task.
-- The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art result on SQuAD dataset.
-- The model architecture has been clearly described.
Paper Weaknesses / Future Thoughts: 
-- The paper provides model's performance when the maximum number of iterations is 1 and 4. I would like to see how the performance of the model changes with the number of iterations, i.e., the model performance when that number is 2 and 3. Is there a clear trend? What type of questions is the model able to get correct with more iterations?
-- As with many deep learning approaches, the overall architecture seems quite complex, and the design choices seem to be driven by performance numbers. As future work, authors might try to analyze qualitative advantages of different choices in the proposed model. What type of questions are correctly answered because of co-attention mechanism instead of attention in a single direction, when using Maxout Highway Network instead of a simple MLP, etc?
Preliminary Evaluation: 
Novel and state-of-the-art question answering approach. Model is clearly described in detail. In my thoughts, a clear accept.
