Summary:
--------
The authors propose a histogram based state representation with differentiable motion models and observation updates for state tracking from observations. Linear model with Gaussian noise is used as the motion model, while a neural network is used to learn the measurement model. They track robot states in: (1) 1-D hallway, and (2) a 2D arena.
Positives:
----------
1. Show how to encode prior knowledge about state-transitions in the architecture.
2. No assumptions about the observation model, which is learned purely from data.
3. Better accuracy than baselines with limited training data.
Negatives:
----------
1. The motion model is too simplistic. The authors in their response to earlier questions say that a generic feed-forward neural network could be used to model more complicated motions. However, then the novelty of their framework is not clear -- as then the proposed model would just be a couple of neural networks to learn the motion and observation models.
2. The observation model again is too simplistic (e.g., one dimensional observations), and is proposed to be a generic feed-forward network. Here again, the technical novelty is not clear.
3. The histogram based representation is not scalable as also highlighted by the authors. Hence, the proposed approach as it is, cannot be applied to more complicated settings.
4. In Figure 5(a,b), where they compare the state-estimation accuracy with other baselines (i.e., LSTMs), it is clear that the accuracy of the LSTM has not saturated, while that of their model has. They should do larger scale experiments with more training data (e.g., 10k,100k,500k samples). 
Note that while sample efficiency is a desirable property (also discussed in Section 6.2), we do expect models with prior knowledge to work better for small number of samples than models which do not assume any structure. Experiments with larger number of samples would be insightful.
