The work presented in this paper proposes a method to get an ensemble of neural networks at no extra training cost (i.e., at the cost of training a single network), by saving snapshots of the network during training. Network is trained using a cyclic (cosine) learning rate schedule; the snapshots are obtained when the learning rate is at the lowest points of the cycles. Using these snapshot ensembles, they show gains in performance over a single network on the image classification task on a variety of datasets.
Positives:
1. The work should be easy to adopt and re-produce, given the simple techinque and the experimental details in the paper.
2. Well written paper, with clear description of the method and thorough experiments.
Suggestions for improvement / other comments:
1. While it is fair to compare against other techniques assuming a fixed computational budget, for a clear perspective, thorough comaprisons with "true ensembles" (i.e., ensembles of networks trained independently) should be provided.
Specificially, Table 4 should be augmented with results from "true ensembles".
2. Comparison with true ensembles is only provided for DenseNet-40 on CIFAR100 in Figure 4. The proposed snapshot ensemble achieves approximately 66% of the improvement of "true ensemble" over the single baseline model. This is not reflected accurately in the authors' claim in the abstract: "[snapshot ensembles] almost match[es] the results of far more expensive independently trained [true ensembles]."
3. As mentioned before: to understand the diversity of snapshot ensembles, it would help to the diversity against different ensembling technique, e.g. (1) "true ensembles", (2) ensembles from dropout as described by Gal et. al, 2016 (Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation).
