The proposed regularizer seems to be a particular combination of existing methods. Though the implied connection between nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers is intriguing, in my opinion the empirical performance does not exceed the performance achieved by similar methods by a large enough margin to arrive at a meaningful conclusion.
