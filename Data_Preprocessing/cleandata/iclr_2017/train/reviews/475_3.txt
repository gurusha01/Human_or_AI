This is an interesting paper on how to handle reparameterization in VAEs when you have discrete variables. The idea is to introduce a smoothing transformation that is shared between the generative model and the recognition model (leading to cancellations). 
A second contribution is to introduce an RBM as the prior model P(z) and to use autoregressive connections in generative and recognition models. The whole package becomes a bit entangled and complex and it is hard to figure out what causes the claimed good performance. Experiments that study these contributions separately would have been nice. 
The framework does become a little complex but this should not be a problem if nice software is delivered that can be used in a plug and play mode.
Overall, the paper is very rich with ideas so I think it would be a great contribution to the conference.
