This was an interesting paper. The algorithm seems clear, the problem well-recognized, and the results are both strong and plausible.
Approaches to hyperparameter optimization based on SMBO have struggled to make good use of convergence during training, and this paper presents a fresh look at a non-SMBO alternative (at least I thought it did, until one of the other reviewers pointed out how much overlap there is with the previously published successive halving algorithm - too bad!). Still, I'm excited to try it. I'm cautiously optimistic that this simple alternative to SMBO may be the first advance to model search for the skeptical practitioner since the case for random search > grid search (
