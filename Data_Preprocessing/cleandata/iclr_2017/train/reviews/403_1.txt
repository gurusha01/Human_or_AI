The paper introduces a novel memory mechanism for NTMs based on differentiable Lie groups. 
This allows to place memory elements as points on a manifold, while still allowing training with backpropagation.
It's a more general version of the NTM memory, and possibly allows for training a more efficient addressing schemes.
Pros:
- novel and interesting idea for memory access
- nicely written
 
Cons:
- need to manually specify the Lie group to use (it would be better if network could learn the best way of accessing memory)                                 
- not clear if this really works better than standard NTM (compared only to simplified version)
- not clear if this is useful in practice (no comparison on real tasks)
