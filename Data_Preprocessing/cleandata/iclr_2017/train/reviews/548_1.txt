Summary:
This paper proposes a regularizer that is claimed to help escaping from the saddle points. The method is inspired from physics, such that thinking of the optimization process is moving a positively charged particle would over the error surface which would be pushed away from saddle points due to the saddle point being positively changed as well. Authors of the paper show results over several different datasets.
Overview of the Review:
    Pros:
        - The idea is very interesting.
        - The diverse set of results on different datasets.
    Cons:
        - The justification is not strong enough.
        - The paper is not well-written.
        - Experiments are not convincing enough.
Criticisms:
I liked the idea and the intuitions coming from the paper. However, I think this paper is not written well. There are some variables introduced in the paper and not explained good-enough, for example in 2.3, the authors start to talk about p without introducing and defining it properly. The only other place it appears before is Equation 6. The Equations need some work as well, some work is needed in terms of improving the flow of the paper, e.g., introducing all the variables properly before using them.
Equation 6 appears without a proper explanation and justification. It is necessary to explain it what it means properly since I think this is one of the most important equation in this paper. More analysis on what it means in terms of optimization point of view would also be appreciated.
$\phi$ is not a parameter, it is a function which has its own hyper-parameter $\alpha$. 
It would be interesting to report validation or test results on a few tasks as well. Since this method introduced as an additional cost function, its effect on the validation/test results would be interesting as well.
The authors should discuss more on how they choose the hyper-parameters of their models. 
The Figure 2 and 3 does not add too much to the paper and they are very difficult to understand or draw any conclusions from. 
There are lots of Figures under 3.4.2 without any labels of captions. Some of them are really small and difficult to understand since the labels on the figures appear very small and somewhat unreadable.
A small question:
* Do you also backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$?
