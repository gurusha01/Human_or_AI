The authors propose to apply virtual adversarial training to semi-supervised classification.
It is quite hard to assess the novelty on the algorithmic side at this stage: there is a huge available literature on semi-supervised learning (especially SVM-related literature, but some work were applied to neural networks too); unfortunately the authors do not mention it, nor relate their approach to it, and stick to the adversarial world.
In terms of novelty on the adversarial side, the authors propose to add perturbations at the level of words embeddings, rather than the input itself (having in mind applications to NLP).
Concerning the experimental section, authors focus on text classification methods. Again, comparison with the existing SVM-related literature is important to assess the viability of the proposed approach; for example (Wang et al, 2012) report 8.8% on IMBD with a very simple linear SVM (without transductive setup).
Overall, the paper reads well and propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm which is shown to work in practice. Theoretical and experimental comparison with past work is missing.
