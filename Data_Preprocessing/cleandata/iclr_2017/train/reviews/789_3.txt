The authors argues that the standard ancestral sampling from stochastic autoencoders (such as the Variational Autoencoder and the Adversarial
Autoencoder) imposes the overly-restrictive constraint that the encoder distribution must marginally match the latent variable prior. They propose, as an alternative, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach that avoids the need to specify a simple parametric form for the prior.
The paper is not clearly written. Most critically, the notation the authors use is either deeply flawed, or there are simple misunderstanding with respect to the manipulations of probability distributions. For example, the authors seem to suggest that both distributions Q(Z|X) and Q(X|Z) are parametrized. For this to be true the model must either be trivially simple, or an energy-based model. There is no indication that they are speaking of an energy-based model. Another example of possible confusion is the statement that the ratio of distributions Q(Z|X)/P(Z) = 1. I believe this is supposed to be a ratio of marginals: Q(Z)/P(X) = 1. Overall, it seems like there is a confusion of what Q and P represent. The standard notation used in VAEs is to use P to represent the decoder distribution and
Q to represent the encoder distribution. This seems not to be how the authors are using these terms. Nor does it seem like there is a single consistent interpretation. 
The empirical results consist entirely of qualitative results (samples and reconstructions) from a single dataset (CelebA). The samples are also not at all up to the quality of the SOTA models. The interpolations shown in Figures 1 and 3 both seems to look like interpolation in pixel space for both the VAE model and the proposed DVAE.
