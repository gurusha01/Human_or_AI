This paper is relatively difficult to parse. Much of the exposition of the proposed algorithm could be better presented using pseudo-code describing the compute flow, or a diagram describing exactly how the updates take place. As it stands, I'm not sure I understand everything. I would also have liked to see exactly described what the various labels in Fig 1 correspond to ("SGD task-wise, 1 comm"? Did you mean layer-wise?).
There are a couple of major issues with the evaluation: first, no comparison is reported against baseline async methods such as using a parameter server. Second, using AlexNet as a benchmark is not informative at all. AlexNet looks very different from any SOTA image recognition model, and in particular it has many fewer layers, which is especially relevant to the discussion in 6.3. It also uses lots of fully-connected layers which affect the compute/communication ratios in ways that are not relevant to most interesting architectures today.
