Thank you for an interesting read.
I found the application of VRNN type generative model to financial data very promising. But since I don't have enough background knowledge to judge whether the performance gap is significant or not, I wouldn't recommend acceptance at this stage. 
To me, the biggest issue for this paper is that I'm not sure if the paper contains significant novelty. The RNN-VAE combination has been around for more than a year and this paper does not propose significant changes to it. Maybe this paper fits better to an application targeting conference, rather than ICLR. But I'm not exactly sure about ICLR's acceptance criteria, and maybe the committee actually prefer great performances and interesting applications?
