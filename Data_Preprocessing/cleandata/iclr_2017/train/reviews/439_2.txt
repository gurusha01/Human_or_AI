The paper presents a technique to combine deep learning style input-output training with search techniques to match the input of a program to the provided output. Orders of magnitude speedup over non-augmented baselines are presented.
Summary:
———
The proposed search for source code implementations based on a rather small domain specific language (DSL) is compelling but also expected to some degree
Quality: The paper is well written.
Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail but the main story is well described.
Originality: The suggested idea to speed up search based techniques using neural nets is perfectly plausible.
Significance: The experimental setup is restricted to smaller scales but the illustrated improvements are clearly apparent.

1. The employed test set of 100 programs seems rather small. in addition the authors ensure that the test set programs are semantically disjoint from the training set programs. Could the authors provide additional details about the small size of the test set and how to the disjoint property is enforced?
2. The length of the programs is rather small at this point in time. A more detailed ablation regarding the runtime seems useful. The search based procedure is probably still the computationally most expensive part. Hence the neural net provides some additional prior information rather than tackling the real task.
