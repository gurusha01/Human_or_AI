This paper presents a strategy for building deep neural networks via rules for expansion and merging of sub-networks.
pros:
- the idea is novel
- the approach is described clearly
cons:
- the experimental evaluation is not convincing, e.g. no improvement on SVHN
- number of parameters should be mentioned for all models for fair comparison
- the effect of drop-path seems to vanish with data augmentation
