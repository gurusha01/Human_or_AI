This paper performs a series of experiments to systematically evaluate the robustness of several defense methods, including RAD, AEC and its improved version etc.. It provides interesting observations. Overall, RAD and distillation have the best performances, but none of the methods can really resist the 'additional' attack from cg or adam. Since it is an experimental paper, my main concern is about its clarity. See the comments below for details.
Pros:
1. This paper provides a good comparison of the performances for the selected methods.
2. Section 3.3 (the 'additional' attack) is a interesting investigation. Although the final result about the defense methods is negative, its results are still inspiring. 
3. Overall, this paper provides interesting and inspiring experimental results about the selected methods.
Cons:
1. There are several other methods in the literature that are missing from the paper. For example the defense methods and the attack methods in the papers [1,2]. 
2. Although a long list of experimental results are provided in the paper, many details are skipped. For example, details of the experiments that generate the results in Table 5. 
3. Without further explanations and analyses about the experimental results, the contribution of the paper seems limited. 
4. This paper proposed an improved version of the AEC algorithm. But its experimental results seems not promising. 
Minor comments:
Page 3: Equation (3) is also non-convex. So the non-convexity of Equation (2) should not be the motivation of Equation (3).
