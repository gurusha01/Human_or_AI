This paper proposes to use the tensor train (TT) decomposition to represent the full polynomial linear model. The TT form can reduce the computation complexity in both of inference and model training. A stochastic gradient over a Riemann Manifold has been proposed to solve the TT based formulation. The empirical experiments validate the proposed method.
The proposed approach is very interesting and novel for me. I would like to vote acceptance on this paper. My only suggestion is to include the computational complexity per iteration.
