The paper describes an alternative view on hierarchical feature representations in deep neural networks. The viewpoint of refining representations is well motivated and is in agreement with the success of recent model structures like ResNets.
Pros:
- Good motivation for the effectiveness of ResNets and Highway networks
- Convincing analysis and evaluation
Cons:
- The effect of this finding of the interpretation of batch-normalization is only captured briefly but seems to be significant
- Explanation of findings in (Zeiler & Fergus (2014)) using UIE viewpoint missing
Remarks:
- Missing word in line 223: "that it is valid"
