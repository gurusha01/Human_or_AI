This paper introduces a hierarchical clustering method using learned CNN features to build 'the tree of life'. The assumption is that the feature similarity indicates the distance in the tree. The authors tried three different ways to construct the tree: 1) approximation central point 2) minimum spanning tree and 3) multidimensional scaling based method. Out of them, MDS works the best. It is a nice application of using deep features. However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following reasons:
1) All experiments are conducted in very small scale. The experiments include 6 fish species, 11 canine species, 8 vehicle classes. There are no quantitative results, only by visualizing the generated tree versus the wordNet tree. Moreover, the assumption of using wordNet is not quite valid. WordNet is not designed for biology purpose and it might not reflect the true evolutionary relationship between species. 
2) Limited technical novelty. Most parts of the pipeline are standard, e.g. use pretrained model for feature extraction, use previous methods to construct hierarchical clustering. I think the technical contribution of this paper is very limited.
