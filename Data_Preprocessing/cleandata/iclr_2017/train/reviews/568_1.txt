This paper proposes a new model for sentence classification. 
Pros:
- Some interesting architecture choices in the network.
Cons:
- No evaluation of the architecture choices. An ablation study is critical here to understand what is important and what is not.
- No evaluation on standard datasets. On the only pre-existing dataset evaluated on a simple TFIDF-SVM method is state-of-the-art, so results are unconvincing.
