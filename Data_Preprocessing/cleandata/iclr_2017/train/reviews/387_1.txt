The paper introduces a variation to the CNN-based texture synthesis procedure of Gatys et al. that matches correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations between feature responses at the same position in the feature maps. 
The paper claims that this 
a) improves texture synthesis for textures with long-range regular structures, that are not preserved with the Gatys et al. method
b) improves performance on texture inpainting tasks compared to the Gatys et al. method
c) improves results in season transfer when combined with the style transfer method by Gatys et al. 
Furthermore the paper shows that
d) by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps, symmetry properties around the flipping axis can be preserved.
I agree with claim a). However, the generated textures still have some issues such as greyish regions so the problem is not solved. Additionally, the procedure proposed is very costly which makes an already slow texture synthesis method substantially slower. For example, in comparison, the concurrent work by Liu et al. (
