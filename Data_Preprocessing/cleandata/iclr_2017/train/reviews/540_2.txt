This paper presents works on neural network / CNN architecture morphing.
Results are not reported on ImageNet larger ResNet and new network architecture such as Xception and DenseNet - which are maybe too new! Also most results are reported in small datasets and network, which do not offer confidence in the usability in production systems.
My biggest issue is that computational time and effort for these techniques is not mentioned in detail. We always want to be able to quantify the extra effort of understanding and using a new technique, especially if the results are minor.
