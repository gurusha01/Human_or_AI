First I would like to apologize for the delay in reviewing.
Summary : this work introduces a novel memory based artificial neural network for reading comprehension. Experiments show improvement on state of the art.
The originality of the approach seems to be on the implementation of an iterative procedure with a loop testing that the current answer is the correct one.
In order to get a better sense of the reason for improvement it would be interesting to have a complexity and/or a time analysis of the algorithm. I might be mistaken but I don't see you reporting anything on the actual number of loops necessary in the reported experiments.
The dataset description in section 2.2, should be moved to section 4 where the other datasets are described.
