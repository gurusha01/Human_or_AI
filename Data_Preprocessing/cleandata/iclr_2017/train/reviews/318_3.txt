The paper proposes an extension of the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network by including in this model the ability to produce complex graph transformations. The underlying idea is to propose a method that will be able build/modify a graph-structure as an internal representation for solving a problem, and particularly for solving question-answering problems in this paper. The author proposes 5 different possible differentiable transformations that will be learned on a training set, typically in a supervised fashion where the state of the graph is given at each timestep. A particular occurence of the model is presented that takes a sequence as an input a iteratively update an internal graph state to a final prediction, and which can be applied for solving QA tasks (e.g BaBi) with interesting results.
The approach  in this paper is really interesting since the proposed model is able to maintain a representation of its current state as a complex graph, but still keeping the property of being differentiable and thus easily learnable through gradient-descent techniques. It can be seen as a succesfull attempt to mix continuous and symbolic representations. It moreover seems more general that the recent attempts made to add some 'symbolic' stuffs in differentiable models (Memory networks, NTM, etc...) since the shape of the state is not fixed here and can evolve. My main concerns is about the way the model is trained i.e by providing the state of the graph at each timestep which can be done for particular tasks (e.g Babi) only, and cannot be the solution for more complex problems. My other concern is about the whole content of the paper that would perhaps best fit a journal format and not a conference format, making the article still difficult to read due to its density.
