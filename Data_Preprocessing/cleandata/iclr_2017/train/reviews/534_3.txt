Thank you for an interesting read.
Given the huge interest in generative modelling nowadays, this paper is very timely and does provide very clear connections between methods that don't use maximum likelihood for training. It made a very useful observation that the generative and the discriminative loss do not need to be coupled with each other. I think this paper in summary provides some very useful insights to the practitioners on how to select the objective function to train the implicit generative model.
The only reason that I decided to hold back my strong acceptance recommendation is that I don't understand the acceptance criteria of ICLR. First this paper has the style very similar to the Sugiyama et al. papers that are cited (e.g. presenting in different perspectives that were all covered in those papers but in a different context), making me unsure about how to evaluate the novelty. Second this paper has no experiment nor mathematical theorem, and I'm not exactly sure what kinds of contributions the ICLR committee is looking for.
