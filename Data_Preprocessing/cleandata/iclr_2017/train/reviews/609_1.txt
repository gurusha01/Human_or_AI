Previous literature uses data-derived adjacency matrix A to obtain neighbors to use as foundation of graph convolution. They propose extending the set of neighbors by additionally including nodes reachable by i<=k steps in this graph. This introduces an extra tunable parameter k, so it needs some justification over the previous k=1 solution. In one experiment providedÂ (Merk), using k=1 worked better. They don't specify which k that used, just that it was big enough for their to be p=5 nodes obtained as neighbors. In the second experiment (MNIST), they used k=1 for their experiments, which is what previous work (Coats & Ng 2011) proposed as well. A compelling experiment would compare to k=1 and show that using k>1 gives improvement strong enough to justify an extra hyper-parameter.
