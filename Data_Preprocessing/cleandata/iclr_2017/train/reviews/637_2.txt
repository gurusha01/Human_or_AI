This paper proposes a process to mine rules from vector space representations learned from KBs (using nonnegative RESCAL).
The paper is nicely written. 
But its motivations are unclear: what is the underlying motivation to mine rules from embedding spaces?
- If it is for better performance on link prediction then the paper does not show this. The experiments do not compare FRM against the performance of the original vector space model.
- If it is for a better interpretability and debugging of the representations learned by vector space models, then there should have more elements on this in the paper.
Other remarks:
- The fact that the performance of the methods in Figure 1 and 2 are not compared to any baseline is problematic.
- The scalability of the rule miner is a big drawback that should be addressed.
- Figure 3 does not do a good job at convincing that rule based systems should be used for prediction or interpretation. The learned rules are bad for both cases.
