This paper proposes a multimodal neural machine translation that is based upon previous work using variational methods but attempts to ground semantics with images. Considering way to improve translation with visual information seems like a sensible thing to do when such data is available. 
As pointed out by a previous reviewer, it is not actually correct to do model selection in the way it was done in the paper. This makes the gains reported by the authors very marginal. In addition, as the author's also said in their question response, it is not clear if the model is really learning to capture useful image semantics. As such, it is unfortunately hard to conclude that this paper contributes to the direction that originally motivated it.
