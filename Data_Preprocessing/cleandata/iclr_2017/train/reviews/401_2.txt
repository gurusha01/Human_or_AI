The paper reads well and the idea is new.
Sadly, many details needed for replicating the results (such as layer sizes of the CNNs, learning rates) are missing. 
The training of the introspection network could have been described in more detail. 
Also, I think that a model, which is closer to the current state-of-the-art should have been used in the ImageNet experiments. That would have made the results more convincing.
Due to the novelty of the idea, I recommend the paper. I would increase the rating if an updated draft addresses the mentioned issues.
