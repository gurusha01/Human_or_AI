The paper provides a first study of customized precision hardware for large convolutional networks, namely alexnet, vgg and googlenet. It shows that it is possible to achieve larger speed-ups using floating-point precision (up to 7x) when using fewer bits, and better than using fixed-point representations. 
The paper also explores predicting custom floating-point precision parameters directly from the neural network activations, avoiding exhaustive search, but i could not follow this part. Only the activations of the last layer are evaluated, but on what data ? On all the validation set ? Why would this be faster than computing the classification accuracy ?
The results should be useful for hardware manufacturers, but with a catch. All popular convolutional networks now use batch normalization, while none of the evaluated ones do. It may well be that the conclusions of this study will be completely different on batch normalization networks, and fixed-point representations are best there, but that remains to be seen. It seems like something worth exploring.
Overall there is not a great deal of novelty other than being a useful study on numerical precision trade-offs at neural network test time. Training time is also something of interest. There are a lot more researchers trying to train new networks fast than trying to evaluate old ones fast. 
I am also no expert in digital logic design, but my educated guess is that this paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold.
