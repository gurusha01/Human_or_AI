This paper is about using denoising autoencoders to improve performance in GANs. In particular, the features as determined by the discriminator, of images generated by the generator, are fed into a denoising AE and we try to have these be reconstructed well. I think it's an interesting idea to use this "extra information" -- namely the feature representations learned by the discriminator. It seems very much in the spirit of ICLR! My main concern, though, is that I'm not wholly convinced on the nature of the improvement. This method achieves higher inception scores than other methods in some cases, but I have a hard time interpreting these scores and thus a hard time getting excited by the results. In particular, the authors have not convinced me that the benefits outweigh the required additional sophistication both conceptually and implementation-wise (speaking of which, will code be released?). One thing I'd be curious to know is, how hard is it to get this thing to actually work? 
Also, I view GANs as a means to an end -- while I'm not particularly excited about generating realistic images (especially in 32x32), I'm very excited about the future potential of GAN-based systems. So it would have been nice to see these improvements in inception score translate into improvements in a more useful task. But this criticism could probably apply to many GAN papers and so perhaps isn't fair here. 
I do think the idea of exploiting "extra information" (like discriminator features) is interesting both inside and outside the context of this paper.
