The paper considers the problem of transferring skills between robots with different morphologies, in the context of agents that have to perform several tasks.  A core component of the proposed approach is to use a task-invariant future space, which can be shared between tasks & between agents.
Compared to previous work (Ammar et al. 2015), it seems the main contribution here is to "assume that good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment" (Sec. 2).  This is an interesting hypothesis. There is also similarity to work by Raimalwala et al (2016), but the authors argue their method is better equipped to handle non-linear dynamics. These are two interesting hypotheses, however I don't see that they have been verified in the presented empirical results.  In particular, the question of the pairing correspondence seems crucial. What happens when the time alignment is not suitable. Is it possible to use dynamic time warping (or similar method) to achieve reasonable results?  Robustness to misspecification of the pairing correspondence P seems a major concern.
In general, more comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Sec.2, would be very valuable.  The addition of Sec.5.1 is definitely a right step in this direction, but represents a small portion of the recent work on transfer learning.  I appreciate that other methods transfer other pieces of information (e.g. the policy), but still if the end goal is better performance, what is worth transferring (in addition to how to do the transfer) should be a reasonable question to explore.
Overall, the paper tackles an important problem, but this is a very active area of research, and further comparison to other methods would be worthwhile.  The method proposed of transferring the representation is well motivated, cleanly described, and conceptually sound.  The assumption that time alignment can be used for the state pairing seems problematic, and should be further validated.
