The paper presents a novel look at binary auto-encoders, formulating the objective function as a min-max reconstruction error over a training set given the observed intermediate representations. The author shows that this formulation leads to a bi-convex problem that can be solved by alternating minimisation methods; this part is non-trivial and is the main contribution of the paper. Proof-of-concept experiments are performed, showing improvements for 1-hidden layer auto-encoders with respect to a vanilla approach. 
The experimental section is fairly weak because the literature on auto-encoders is huge and many variants were shown to perform better than straightforward approaches without being more complicated (e.g., denoising auto-encoders). Yet, the paper presents an analysis that leads to a new learning algorithm for an old problem, and is likely worth discussing.
