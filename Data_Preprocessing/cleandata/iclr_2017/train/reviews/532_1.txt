Paper is easy to follow, Idea is pretty clear and makes sense.
Experimental results are hard to judge, it would be nice to have other baselines.
For faster training convergence, the question is how well tuned SGD is, I didn't
see any mentioning of learning rate schedule. Also, it would be important to test
this on other data sets. Success with filtering training data could be task dependent.
