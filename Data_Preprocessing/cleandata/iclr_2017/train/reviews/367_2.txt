The author attacks the problem of shallow binary autoencoders using a minmax game approach. The algorithm, though simple, appears to be very effective. The paper is well written and has sound analyses. Although the work does not extend to deep networks immediately, its connections with other popular minmax approaches (eg GANs) could be fruitful in the future.
