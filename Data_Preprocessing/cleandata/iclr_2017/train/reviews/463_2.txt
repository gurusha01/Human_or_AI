The paper addressed the erroneous label problem for supervised training. The problem is well formulated and the presented solution is novel. 
The experimental justification is limited. The effectiveness of the proposed method is hard to gauge, especially how to scale the proposed method to large number of classification targets and whether it is still effective.
For example, it would be interesting to see whether the proposed method is better than training with only less but high quality data. 
From Figure 2, it seems with more data, the proposed method tends to behave very well when the noise fraction is below a threshold and dramatically degrades once passing that threshold. Analysis and justification of this behavior whether it is just by chance or an expected one of the method would be very useful.
