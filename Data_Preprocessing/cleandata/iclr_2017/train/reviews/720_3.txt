In this paper, the author proposed an approach for feature combination of two embeddings v1 and v2. This is done by first computing the pairwise combinations of the elements of v1 and v2 (with complicated nonlinearity), and then pick the K-Max as the output vector. For triple (or higher-order) combinations, two (or more) consecutive pairwise combinations are performed to yield the final representations. It seems that the approach is not directly related to categorical data, and can be applied to any embeddings (even if they are not one-hot). So is there any motivation that brings about this particular approach? What is the connection? 
There are many papers with similar ideas. CCPM (A convolutional click prediction model) that the authors have compared against, also proposes very similar network structure (conv + K-max + conv + K-max). In the paper, the author does not mention their conceptual similarity and difference versus CCPM. Compact Bilinear Pooling,
