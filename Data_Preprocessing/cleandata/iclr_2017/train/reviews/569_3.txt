This paper describes a method that estimates the similarity between a set of images by alternatively attend each image with a recurrent manner. The idea of the paper is interesting, which mimic the human's behavior. However, there are several cons of the paper:
1. The paper is now well written. There are too many 'TODO', 'CITE' in the final version of the paper, which indicates that the paper is submitted in a rush or the authors did not take much care about the paper. I think the paper is not suitable to be published with the current version.
2. The missing of the experimental results. The paper mentioned the LFW dataset. However, the paper did not provide the results on LFW dataset. (At least I did not find it in the version of Dec. 13th)
3. The experiments of Omniglot dataset are not sufficient. I suggest that the paper provides some illustrations about how the model the attend two images (e.g. the trajectory of attend).
It is weird that the paper describe LFW dataset but do not provides the results on it.
