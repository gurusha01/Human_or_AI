This paper introduces a nonlinear dynamical model for multiple related multivariate time series. It models a linear observation model conditioned on the latent variables, a linear or nonlinear dynamical model between consecutive latent variables and a similarity constraint between any two time series (provided as prior data and non-learnable). The predictions/constraints given by the three components of the model are Gaussian, because the model predicts both the mean and the variance or covariance matrix. Inference is forward only.
The model is evaluated on four datasets, and compared to several baselines: plain auto-regressive models, feed-forward networks, RNN and dynamic factor graphs DFGs, which are RNNs with forward and backward inference of the latent variables.
The model, which introduces lateral constraints between different time series, and which predicts both the mean and covariance seems interesting, but presents two limitations.
First of all, the paper should refer to variational auto-encoders / deep gaussian models, which also predict the mean and the variance during inference.
Secondly, the datasets are extremely small. For example, the WHO contains only 91 times series of 52*10 = 520 time points. Although the experiments seem to suggest that the proposed model tends to outperform RNNs, the datasets are very small and the high variance in the results indicates that further experiments, with longer time series, are required. The paper could also easily be extended with more information about the model (what is the architecture of the MLP) as well as time complexity comparison between the models (especially between DFGs and this model).
Minor remark:
The footnote 2 on page 5 seems to refer to the structural regularization term, not to the dynamical term.
