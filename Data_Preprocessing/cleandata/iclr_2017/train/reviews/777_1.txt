The paper introduces supervised deep learning with layer-wise reconstruction loss (in addition to the supervised loss) and class-conditional semantic additive noise for better representation learning. Total correlation measure and additional insights from auto-encoder are used to derive layer-wise reconstruction loss and is further combined with supervised loss. When combining with supervised loss the class-conditional additive noise model is proposed, which showed consistent improvement over the baseline model. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets while changing the number of training examples per class are done extensively.
The derivation of Equation (3) from total correlation is hacky. Moreover, assuming graphical model between X, Y and Z, it should be more carefully derived to estimate H(X|Z) and H(Z|Y). The current proposal, encoding Z and Y from X and decoding from encoded representation is not really well justified.
Is \sigma in Equation 8 trainable parameter or hyperparameter? If it is trainable how it is trained? If it is not, how are they set? Does j correspond to one of the class? The proposed feature augmentation sounds like simply adding gaussian noise to the pre-softmax neurons. That being said, the proposed method is not different from gaussian dropout (Wang and Manning, ICML 2013) but applied on different layers. In addition, there is a missing reference (DisturbLabel: Regularizing CNN on the Loss Layer, CVPR 2016) that applied synthetic noise process on the loss layer.
Experiments should be done for multiple times with different random subsets and authors should provide mean and standard error. Overall, I believe the proposed method is not very well justified and has limited novelty.
