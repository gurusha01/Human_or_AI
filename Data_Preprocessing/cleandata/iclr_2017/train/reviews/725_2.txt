This paper builds connections between DNN, simplified stochastic neural network (SFNN) and SFNN and proposes to use DNN as the initialization model for simplified SFNN. The authors evaluated their model on several small tasks with positive results.
The connection between different models is interesting. I think the connection between sigmoid DNN and Simplified SFNN is the same as mean-field approximation that has been known for decades. However, the connection between ReLU DNN and simplified SFNN is novel.
My main concern is whether the proposed approach is useful when attacking real tasks with large training set. For tasks with small training set I can see that stochastic units would help generalize well.
