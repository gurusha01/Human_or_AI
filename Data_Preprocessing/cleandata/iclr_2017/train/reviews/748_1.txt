The system described works comparably to bi-directional LSTM baseline for NMT, and CNN's are naturally parallelizable.
Key ideas include the use of two stacked CNN's (one for each of encoding and decoding) for translation, with res connections and position embeddings. The use of CNN's for translation has been attempted previously (as described by the authors), but presumably it is the authors' combination of various architectural choices (attention, position embeddings, etc) that make the present system competitive with RNN's, whereas earlier attempts were not. They describe system's sensitivity to some of these choices (e.g. experiments to choose appropriate number of layers in each of the CNN's).
The experimental results are well reported in detail.
One or two figures would definitely be required to help clarify the architecture.
This paper is less about new ways of learning representations than about the combination of choices made (over the set of existing techniques) in order to get the good results that they do on the reported NMT tasks. In this respect, while I am fairly confident that the paper represents good work in machine learning, I am not quite as confident about its fit for this particular conference.
