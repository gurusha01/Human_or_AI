The paper under consideration proposes a set of procedures for incrementally expanding a residual network by adding layers via a boosting criterion.
The main barrier to publication is the weak empirical validation. The tasks considered are quite small scale in 2016 (and MNIST with a convolutional net is basically an uninteresting test by this point). The paper doesn't compare to the literature, and CIFAR-10 results fail to improve upon rather simple, single-network published baselines (Springenberg et al, 2015 for example, obtains 92% without data augmentation) and I'm pretty sure there's a simple ResNet result somewhere that outshines these too. The CIFAR100 results are a little bit interesting as they are better than I'm used to seeing (I haven't done a recent literature crawl), and this is unsurprising -- you'd expect ensembles to do well when there's a dearth of labeled training data, and here there are only a few hundred per label. But then it's typical on both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 to use simple data augmentation schemes which aren't employed here, and these and other forms of regularization are a simpler alternative to a complicated iterative augmentation scheme like this.
It'd be easier to sell this method either as an option for scarce labeled datasets where data augmentation is non-trivial (but then for most image-related applications, random crops and reflections are easy and valid), but that would necessitate different benchmarks, and comparison against simpler methods like said data augmentation, dropout (especially, due to the ensemble interpretation), and so on.
