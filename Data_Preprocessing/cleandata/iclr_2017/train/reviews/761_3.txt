The authors explore the idea of deep-learning a static analyzer. They do it with a toy programming language and a very simplified analysis problem -- just checking if all variables are initalized.
While the idea is interesting and might be developped into a tool in the future, the toy task presented in this paper is too simple to warrant an ICLR submission. Just detecting whether a variable is initialized in a string is a toy algorihtmic task, similar to the ones solved in a number of paper in recent years by models such as the Neural Turing Machine, Stack RNNs, Neural GPU, or Differentiable Neural Computer. All these architectures perform almost perfectly on a number of algorithmic tasks, so it is highly probable that they would also solve this one. Unluckily, the authors only compare to much more basic models, such as HMMs. Since the code for many of the above-mentioned models is available online, a paper without these baselines is not ready for ICLR. Moreover, there is a risk that existing models already solve this problem very well, making the contribution unclear.
