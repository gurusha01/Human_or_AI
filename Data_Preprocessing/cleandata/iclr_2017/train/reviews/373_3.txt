This paper presents a clear hierarchical taxonomy of transfer learning methods as applicable to sequence tagging problems. This contextualizes and unifies previous work on specific instances of this taxonomy. Moreover, the paper shows that previously unexplored places in this taxonomy are competitive with or superior to the state of the art in key benchmark problems.
It'd be nice to see this explored further, such as highlighting what is the loss as you move from the more restrictive to the less restrictive transfer learning approaches, but I believe this paper is interesting and acceptable as-is.
