The paper is an extension of the matching networks by Vinyals et al. in NIPS2016. Instead of using all the examples in the support set during test, the method represents each class by the mean of its learned embeddings. The training procedure and experimental setting are very similar to the original matching networks. I am not completely sure about its advantages over the original matching networks. It seems to me when dealing with 1-shot case, these two methods are identical since there is only one example seen in this class, so the mean of the embedding is the embedding itself. When dealing with 5-shot case, original matching networks compute the weighted average of all examples, but it is at most 5x cost. The experimental results reported for prototypical nets are only slightly better than matching networks. I  think it is a simple, straightforward,  novel extension, but I am not fully convinced its advantages.
