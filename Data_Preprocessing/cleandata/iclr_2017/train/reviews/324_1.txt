The idea of "pruning where it matters" is great. The authors do a very good job of thinking it through, and taking to the next level by studying pruning across different layers too.
Extra points for clarity of the description and good pictures. Even more extra points for actually specifying what spaces are which layers are mapping into which (\mathbb symbol - two thumbs up!).
The experiments are well done and the results are encouraging. Of course, more experiments would be even nicer, but is it ever not the case?
My question/issue - is the proposed pruning criterion proposed? Yes, pruning on the filter level is what in my opinion is the way to go, but I would be curious how the "min sum of weights" criterion compares to other approaches.
How does it compare to other pruning criteria? Is it better than "pruning at random"?
Overall, I liked the paper.
