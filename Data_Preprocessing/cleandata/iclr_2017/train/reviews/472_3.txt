I'd like to thank the authors for their detailed response to my questions.
The paper proposes a support regularized version of sparse coding that takes into account the underlying manifold structure of the data. For this purpose, the authors augment the classic sparse coding loss with a term that encourages near by points to have similar active set. Convergence guarantees for the optimization procedure are presented. Experimental evaluation on clustering and semi-supervised learning shows the benefits of the proposed approach.
The paper is well written and a nice read. The most relevant contribution of this work is to including (and optimizing) the regularization function, and not an approximation or surrogate. The authors derive a a PGD-styple iterative method and present convergence analysis for it. 
Thanks for the clarifications regarding the assumptions used in Section 3. It would be nice to include some of that in the manuscript.
The authors also propose a fast encoding scheme for their proposed method. 
The authors included a new experiment in semi-supervised consists of a very interesting use (of the method and the fast approximation). While this is an interesting addition, I think that using fast encoders is not particularly novel or the main part of the work. "Converting" iterative optimization algorithms into feed-forward nets for accelerating the inference process has been done in the past (several times with quite similar problems). Is natural that this can be done, and not very surprising. Maybe would be interesting to evaluate how important is to have an architecture matching the optimization algorithm, compared to a generic network (though some of this analysis has also been performed in the past).
