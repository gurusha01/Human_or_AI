Pros:
  Interesting training criterion.
Cons:
  Missing proper ASR technique based baselines.
Comments:
  The dataset is quite small.
  ROC curves for detection, and more measurements, e.g. EER would probably be helpful besides AP.
  More detailed analysis of the results would be necessary, e.g. precision of words seen during training compared to the detection
  performance of out-of-vocabulary words.
  It would be interesting to show scatter plots for embedding vs. orthographic distances.
