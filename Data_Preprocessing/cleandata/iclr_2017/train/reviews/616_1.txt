In this work, the authors propose to use a (perhaps deterministic) retrieval function to replace uniform sampling over the train data in training the discriminator of a GAN.
Although I like the basic idea, the experiments are very weak.  There are essentially no quantitative results, no real baselines, and only a small amount of not especially convincing qualititative results.   It is honestly hard to review the paper- there isn't any semblance of normal experimental validation.
Note:  what is happening with the curves in fig. 6?
