The paper investigates a simple extension of Gatys et al. CNN-based texture descriptors for image generation. Similar to Gatys et al., the method uses as texture descriptor the empirical intra-channel correlation matrix of the CNN feature response at some layer of a deep network. Differently from Gatys et al., longer range correlations are measured by introducing a shift between the correlated feature responses, which translates in a simple modification of the original architecture.
The idea is simple but has interesting effects on the generated textures and can be extended to transformations other than translation. While longer range correlations could be accounted for by considering the response of deeper CNN features in the original method by Gatys et al., the authors show that modelling them explicitly using shallower features is more effective, which is reasonable.
An important limitation that this work shares with most of its peers is the lack of a principled quantitative evaluation protocol, such that judging the effectiveness of the approach remains almost entirely a qualitative affair. While this should not be considered a significant drawback of the paper due to the objective difficulty of solving this open issue, nevertheless it is somewhat limiting that no principled evaluation method could be devised and implemented. The authors suggest that, as future work, a possible evaluation method could be based on a classification task -- this is a potentially interesting approach that merits some further investigation.
