This paper revives a classic idea involving regularization for purposes of compression for modern CNN models on resource constrained devices. Model compression is hot and we're in the midst of lots of people rediscovering old ideas in this area so it is nice to have a paper that explicitly draws upon classic approaches from the early 90s to obtain competitive results on standard benchmarks.
There's not too much to say here: this study is an instance of a simple idea applied effectively to an important problem, written up in an illuminating manner with appropriate references to classic approaches. The addition of the filter visualizations enhances the contribution.
