In this paper, the authors present several strategies to select a small subset of target vocabulary to work with per source sentence, which results in significant speedup. The results are convincing and I think this paper offers practical values to general seq2seq approaches to language tasks. However, there is little novelty in this work: the authors further mostly extend the work of (Mi et al., 2016) with more vocabulary selection strategies and thorough experiments. This paper will fit better in an NLP venue.
