This paper has two main contributions: 
(1) Applying adversarial training to imagenet, a larger dataset than previously considered 
(2) Comparing different adversarial training approaches, focusing importantly on the transferability of different methods. The authors also uncover and explain the label leaking effect which is an important contribution.
This paper is clear, well written and does a good job of assessing and comparing adversarial training methods and understanding their relation to one another. A wide range of empirical results are shown which helps elucidate the adversarial training procedure. This paper makes an important contribution towards understand adversarial training and believe ICLR is an appropriate venue for this work.
