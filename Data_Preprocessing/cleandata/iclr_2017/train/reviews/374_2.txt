I think the problem here is well motivated, the approach is insightful and intuitive, and the results are convincing of the approach (although lacking in variety of applications). I like the fact that the authors use POS and NER in terms of an intermediate signal for the decision. Also they compare against a sufficient range of baselines to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.
I am also convinced by the authors' answers to my question, I think there is sufficient evidence provided in the results to show the effectiveness of the inductive bias introduced by the fine-grained gating model.
