This paper proposed two incremental ideas to extend the current state-of-the-art summarization work based on seq2seq models with attention and copy/pointer mechanisms.
1. This paper introduces 2-pass reading where the representations from the 1st-pass is used to  re-wight the contribution of each word to the sequential representation of the 2nd-pass. The authors described how such a so-called read-again process applies to both GRU and LSTM.
 
2. On the decoder side, the authors also use the softmax to choose between generating from decoder vocabulary and copying a source position, with a new twist of representing the previous decoded word Y_{t-1} differently. This allows the author to explore a smaller decoder vocabulary hence led to faster inference time without losing summarization performance.
 
This paper claims the new state-of-the-art on DUC2004 but the comparison on Gigaword seems to be incomplete (missing more recent results after Rush 2015 etc). While the overall work is solid, there are also other things missing scientifically. For example, 
- how much computational costs does the 2nd pass reading add to the end-to-end system? 
- How does the decoder small vocabulary trick work without 2nd-pass reading on the encoder side for both summarization performance and runtime speed?
- There are other ways to improve the embedding of a sentence. How does the 2nd-pass reading compare to recent work from multiple authors on self-attention and/or LSTMN? For example, Cheng et al. 2016, Long Short-Term Memory-Networks for Machine Reading; Parikh et al. 2016, A Decomposable Attention Model for Natural Language Inference?
