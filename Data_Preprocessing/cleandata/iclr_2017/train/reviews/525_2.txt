Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm to learn the structure of continuous SPNs in a single pass through the data,
basically by "growing" the SPN when two variables are correlated.
NOTE
I am not an expert on SPNs, and can not really judge how impressive the presented results are due to lack of familiarity with the datsets.
Pro
- This looks like possibly impactful work, proposing a simple and elegant algorithm for learning SPN structure single-pass, rather than just using random structure which has been done in other work in the online settings.
Con
- The paper is heavily updated between submission deadline and submission of reviews.
- The paper reads like a rush job, sloppily written - at least the first version.
- Comparison to literature is severely lacking; eg "several automated structure learning techniques have been proposed" followed by 6 citations but no discussion of any of them, which one is most related, which ideas carry over from the offline setting to this online setting, etc. Also since this work presents both joint structure & parameter learning, comparison to the online parameter learning papers (3 cited) would be appreciated, specifically since these prior approaches seem to be more principled with Bayesian Moment Matching in Jaini 2016 for example.
- I do not know enough about SPNs and the datasets to properly judge how strong the results are, but they seem to be a bit underwhelming on the large datasets wrt Random
Remaining questions after the paper updates
- Table 3: Random structure as baseline ok, but how were the parameters here learned? Your simple running average or with more advanced methods?
- Table 1: you are presenting positive average log-likelihood values? This should be an average of log(p<=1) < 0 values? What am I missing here?
I recommend reject mostly because this paper should have been finished and polished at submission time, not at review deadline time.
