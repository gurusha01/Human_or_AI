The paper proposes to use the very standard SVGB in a sequential setting like several previous works did. However, they proposes to have a clear state space constraints similar to Linear Gaussian Models: Markovian latent space and conditional independence of observed variables given the latent variables. However the model is in this case non-linear. These assumptions are well motivated by the goal of having meaningful latent variables.
The experiments are interesting but I'm still not completely convinced by the regression results in Figure 3, namely that one could obtain the angle and velocity from the state but using a function more powerful than a linear function. Also, why isn't the model from (Watter et al., 2015) not included ?
After rereading I'm not sure I understand why the coordinates should be combined in a 3x3 checkerboard as said in Figure 5a. 
Then paper is well motivated and the resulting model is novel enough, the bouncing ball experiment is not quite convincing, especially in prediction, as the problem is fully determined by its initial velocity and position.
