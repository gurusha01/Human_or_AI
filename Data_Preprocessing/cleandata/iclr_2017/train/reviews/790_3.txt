This paper proposed to use GAN for encrypted communications.
In section 2, the authors proposed a 3 part neural network trained to encode and decode data. This model does not have any practical value except paving the way for describing the next model in section 3: it is strictly worse than any provable cryptography system.
In section 3, the authors designed a task where they want to hide part of the data, which has correlated fields, while publishing the rest. However, I'm having trouble thinking of an application where this system is better than simply decorrelating the data and encrypting the fields one wants to hide with a provable cryptography system while publishing the rest in plain text.
