This paper presents two RNN architectures for extractive document summarization. The first one, Classifier, takes into account the order in which sentences appear in the original document, whereas the second one, Selector, chooses sentences in an arbitrary order. For each architecture, the concatenated RNN hidden state from a sentence forward and backward pass  is used as features to compute a score that captures content richness, salience, positional importance, and redundancy. Both models are trained in a supervised manner, so the authors used "pseudo-ground truth generation" to create training data from abstractive summaries. Experiments show that the Classifier model performs better, and it achieves near state-of-the-art performance for some evaluation metrics.
The proposed model is in general an extension of Cheng and Lapata, 2016. Unfortunately, the performance is only slightly better or sometimes even worse. The authors mentioned that one key difference how they transform abstractive summaries to become gold labels for the supervised method. However, in the experiment results, the authors described that one potential reason their models do not consistently outperform the extractive model of Cheng & Lapata, 2016 is that the unsupervised greedy approximation may generate noisier ground truth labels than Cheng & Lapata. Is there a reason to construct the training data similar to Cheng & Lapata, if that turns out to be a better method?
In order for the proposed models to be convincing, they need to outperform this baseline that's very similar to the proposed methods more consistently, since the main contribution is improved neural architectures for extractive document summarization.
