This paper presented an unsupervised approach for the automatic segmentation of bioacoustic data. The authors applied an existing approach (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models) to their task. The originality of their work is the investigation of this approach on a new task, which they argue is more difficult, namely bioacoustic segmentation. They provide evidence that this is a difficult task by explaining that there doesn't exist a consensus among human experts on how this should be done. However, they do not provide convincing results that their approach is successful, as it fails in many cases to replicate the correct segmentations as defined by their baseline: human experts. In addition, the clarity of the writing is extremely poor, including many grammatical errors and awkward sentences.
