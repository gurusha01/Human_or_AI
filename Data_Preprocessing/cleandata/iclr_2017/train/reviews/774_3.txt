In this paper the authors propose various techniques to sample visualizations from generative models with high dimensional latent spaces like VAEs and GANs. For example, the authors highlight the well known but often not sufficiently appreciated fact that the probability mass of high dimensional Gaussian distributions concentrates near a thin hyper-shell with a certain radius. They therefore propose to use spherical interpolations (great arcs) instead of the commonly used linear interpolations. In a similar spirit they propose a visualisation for analogies and techniques to reinforce structure in VAE latent spaces.
I find it hard to give clear recommendation for this paper: On the one hand I enjoyed reading it and I might want use some of the proposals (e.g. spherical interpolations; J-diagrams) in future work of mine. On the other hand, it's obvious that this paper is not a typical machine learning paper; it does not propose a new model, or training method, or provide (theoretical/empirical) insight and it does not have the scientific quality and depth I've seen in many other ICLR submissions. But it does more than just describing useful "tricks". And all things considered I think this paper deserves a wider audience (but  I'm not convinced that ICLR is the right venue)
