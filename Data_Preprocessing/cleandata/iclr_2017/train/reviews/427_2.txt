The authors propose a way to visualize which areas of an image provide mostly influence a certain DNN response mostly. They apply some very elegant and convincing improvements to the basic method by Robnik-Sikonja and Konononko from 2008 to DNNs, thus improving it's analysis and making it usable for images and DNNs.
The authors provide a very thorough analysis of their methods and show very convincing examples (which they however handpicked. It would be very nice to have maybe at least one figure showing the analysis on e.g. 24 random picks from ImageNet).
One thing I would like to see is how their method compares to some other methods they mention in the introduction (like gradient-based ones or deconvolution based ones). 
They paper is very clearly written, all necessary details are given and the paper is very nice to read.
Alltogether: The problem of understanding how DNNs function and how they draw their conclusions is discussed a lot. The author's method provides a clear contribution that can lead to further progress in this field (E.g. I like figure 8 showing how AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG differ in where they collect evidence from). I can think of several potential applications of the method and therefore consider it of high significance.
Update: The authors did a great job of adopting all of my suggestions. Therefore I improve the rating from 8 to 9.
