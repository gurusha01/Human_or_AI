The authors propose a time-series model with discrete states for robotics applications. I think the proposed method is too simplistic to be useful in the presented form, eg. 1) the state space (dimensionality & topology) is exactly matched to the experiments 2) displacements in the transition model are linear in the actions 3) observations are one-dimensional. This seems to be quite behind the current state of the art, eg "Embed to Control" by Watter et al 2015, where a state representation is learned directly from pixels.
Furthermore the authors do not compare to any other method except for an out-of-the-box LSTM model. Also, I feel like there must be a lot of prior work for combining HMMs + NNs out there, I think it would be necessary for the authors to relate their work to this literature.
