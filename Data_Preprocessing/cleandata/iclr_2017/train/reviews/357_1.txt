This paper introduces an approach for future frame prediction in videos by decoupling motion and content to be encoded separately, and additionally using multi-scale residual connections. Qualitative and quantitative results are shown on KTH, Weizmann, and UCF-101 datasets.
The idea of decoupling motion and content is interesting, and seems to work well for this task. However, the novelty is relatively incremental given previous cited work on multi-stream networks, and it is not clear that this particular decoupling works well or is of broader interest beyond the specific task of future frame prediction.
While results on KTH and Weizmann are convincing and significantly outperform baselines, the results are less impressive on less constrained UCF-101 dataset.  The qualitative examples for UCF-101 are not convincing, as discussed in the pre-review question.
Overall this is a well-executed work with an interesting though not extremely novel idea. Given the limited novelty of decoupling motion and content and impact beyond the specific application, the paper would be strengthened if this could be shown to be of broader interest e.g. for other video tasks.
