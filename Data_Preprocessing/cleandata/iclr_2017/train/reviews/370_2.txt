Summary: 
The paper proposes a model training strategy to achieve higher accuracy. The issue is train a too large model and you going to over-fit and your model will capture noise. Prune models or make it too small then it will miss important connections and under-fit. Thus, the proposed method involves various training steps: first they train a dense network, then prune it making it sparse then train a sparse network and finally they add connections back and train the model as dense again (DSD). The DSD method is generic method that can be used in CNN/RNN/LSTM. The reasons why models have better accuracy after DSD are: escape of saddle point, sparsity makes model more robust to noise and symmetry break allowing richer representations.
Pro:
The main point that this paper wants to show is that a model has the capacity to achieve higher accuracy, because it was shown that it is possible to compress a model without losing accuracy. And lossless compression means that there's significant redundancy in the models that were trained using current training methods. This is an important observation that large models can get better accuracies as better training schemes are used. 
Cons & Questions:
The issue is that the accuracy is slightly increased (2 or 3%) for most models. And the question is what is the price paid for this improvement? Resource and performance concerns arises because training a large model is computationally expensive (hours or even days using high performance GPUs).
Second question, can I keep adding Dense, Sparse and Dense training iterations to get higher and higher accuracy improvement? Are there limitations to this DSDSDâ€¦ approach?
