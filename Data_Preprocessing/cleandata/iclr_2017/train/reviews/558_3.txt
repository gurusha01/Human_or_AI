This paper proposed to use a simple count-based exploration technique in high-dimensional RL application (e.g., Atari Games). The counting is based on state hash, which implicitly groups (quantizes) similar state together. The hash is computed either via hand-designed features or learned features (unsupervisedly with auto-encoder). The new state to be explored receives a bonus similar to UCB (to encourage further exploration).
Overall the paper is solid with quite extensive experiments. I wonder how it generalizes to more Atari games. Montezuma's Revenge may be particularly suitable for approaches that implicitly/explicitly cluster states together (like the proposed one), as it has multiple distinct scenarios, each with small variations in terms of visual appearance, showing clustering structures. On the other hand, such approaches might not work as well if the state space is fully continuous (e.g. in RLLab experiments). 
The authors did not answer my question about why the hash code needs to be updated during training. I think it is mainly because the code still needs to be adaptive for a particular game (to achieve lower reconstruction error) in the first few iterations . After that stabilization is the most important. Sec. 2.3 (Learned embedding) is quite confusing (but very important). I hope that the authors could make it more clear (e.g., by writing an algorithm block) in the next version.
