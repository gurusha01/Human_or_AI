This paper tackles the problem of compressing trained convnets with the goal of reducing memory overhead and speeding up the forward pass. As I understand it, the main contribution of this work is to develop fast convolution routines for sparse conv weights int he case of general sparsity (as compared with structured sparsity). They evaluate their method on both AlexNet and GoogLeNet as well as on various platforms. The authors make code available online. The paper is well written and does a good job of putting this work in the context of past model reduction techniques.
My main request of the authors would be to provide a concise summary of the speedup/memory gains achievable with this new work compared with previously published work. The authors do show the various sparsity level obtained with various methods of pruning but it is unclear to me how to translate the information given in the paper into an understanding of gains relative to other methods.
