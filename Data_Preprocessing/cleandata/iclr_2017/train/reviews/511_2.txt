Approximating solutions to PDEs with NN approximators is very hard. In particular the HJB and HJI eqs have in general discontinuous and non-differentiable solutions making them particularly tricky (unless the underlying process is a diffusion in which case the Ito term makes everything smooth, but this paper doesn't do that). What's worse, there is no direct correlation between a small PDE residual and a well performing-policy [tsitsiklis? beard? todorov?, I forget]. There's been lots of work on this which is not properly cited. 
The 2D toy examples are inadequate. What reason is there to think this will scale to do anything useful? 
There are a bunch of typos ("Range-Kutta"?) .
More than anything, this paper is submitted to the wrong venue. There are no learned representations here. You're just using a NN. That's not what ICLR is about. Resubmit to ACC, ADPRL or CDC.
Sorry for terseness. Despite rough review, I absolutely love this direction of research. More than anything, you have to solve harder control problems for people to take notice...
