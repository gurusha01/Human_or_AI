This paper extends an approach to rate-distortion optimization to deep encoders and decoders, and from a simple entropy encoding scheme to adaptive entropy coding. In addition, the paper discusses the approach's relationship to variational autoencoders.
Given that the approach to rate-distortion optimization has already been published, the novelty of this submission is arguably not very high (correct me if I missed a new trick). In some ways, this paper even represents a step backward, since earlier work optimized for a perceptual metric where here MSE is used. However, the results are a visible improvement over JPEG 2000, and I don't know of any other learned encoding which has been shown to achieve this level of performance. The paper is very well written.
Equation 10 appears to be wrong and I believe the partition function should depend on g_s(y; theta). This would mean that the approach is not equivalent to a VAE for non-Euclidean metrics.
What was the reason for optimizing MSE rather than a perceptual metric as in previous work? Given the author's backgrounds, it is surprising that even the evaluation was only performed in terms of PSNR.
What is the contribution of adaptive entropy coding versus the effect of deeper encoders and decoders? This seems like an important piece of information, so it would be interesting to see the performance without adaptation as in the previous paper. More detail on the adaptive coder and its effects should be provided, and I will be happy to give a higher score when the authors do.
