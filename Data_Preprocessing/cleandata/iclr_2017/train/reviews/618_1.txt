This paper presents an improved formulation of CNN, aiming to separate geometric transformation from inherent features. The network can estimate the transformation of filters given the input images. 
This work is based on a solid technical foundation and is motivated by a plausible rationale. Yet, the value of this work in practice is subject to questions:
(1) It relies on the assumption that the input image is subject to a transformation on a certain Lie group (locally). Do such transformations constitute real challenges in practice? State-of-the-art CNNs, e.g. ResNet, are already quite resilient to such local deformations. What such components would add to the state of the art? Limited experiments on Cifar-10 does not seem to provide a very strong argument.
(2) The computational cost is not discussed.
