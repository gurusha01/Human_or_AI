the paper proposed a method mainly for graph classification. The proposal is to decompose graphs objects into hierarchies of small graphs followed by generating vector embeddings and aggregation using deep networks. 
The approach is reasonable and intuitive however, experiments do not show superiority of their approach. 
The proposed method outperforms Yanardag et al. 2015 and Niepert et al., 2016 on social networks graphs but are quite inferior to Niepert et al., 2016 on bio-informatics datasets. the authors did not report acccuracy for Yanardag et al. 2015 which on similar bio-ddatasets for example NCI1 is 80%, significantly better than achieved by the proposed method. The authors claim that their method is tailored for social networks graph more is not supported by good arguments? what models of graphs is this method more suitable?
