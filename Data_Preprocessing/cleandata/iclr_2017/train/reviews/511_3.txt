I have no familiarity with the HJI PDE (I've only dealt with parabolic PDE's such as diffusion in the past). So the details of transforming this problem into a supervised loss escape me. Therefore, as indicated below, my review should be taken as an "educated guess". I imagine that many readers of ICLR will face a similar problem as me, and so, if this paper is accepted, at the least the authors should prepare an appendix that provides an introduction to the HJI PDE. At a high level, my comments are:
1. It seems that another disadvantage of this approach is that a new network must be trained for each new domain (including domain size), system function f(x) or boundary condition. If that is correct, I wonder if it's worth the trouble when existing tools already solve these PDE's. Can the authors shed light on a more "unifying approach" that would require minimal changes to generalize across PDE's?
2. How sensitive is the network's result to domains of different sizes? It seems only a single size 51 x 51 was tested. Do errors increase with domain size?
3. How general is this approach to PDE's of other types e.g. diffusion?
