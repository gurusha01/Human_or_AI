This paper examines computational creativity from a machine learning perspective. Creativity is defined as a model's ability to generate new types of objects unseen during training. The authors argue that likelihood training and evaluation are by construction ill-suited for out-of-class generation and propose a new evaluation framework which relies on the use of held-out classes of objects to measure a model's ability to generate new and interesting object types.
I am not very familiar with the literature on computational creativity research, so I can't judge on how well this work has been put into the context of existing work. From a machine learning perspective, I find the ideas presented in this paper new, interesting and thought-provoking.
As I understand, the hypothesis is that the ability of a model to generate new and interesting types we do not know about correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types we do know about, and the latter is a good proxy for the former. The extent to which this is true depends on the bias introduced by model selection. Just like when measuring generalization performance, one should be careful not to reuse the same held-out classes for model selection and for evaluation.
Nevertheless, I appreciate the effort that has been made to formalize the notion of computational creativity within the machine learning framework. I view it as an important first step in that direction, and I think it deserves its place at ICLR, especially given that the paper is well-written and approachable for machine learning researchers.
