This work proposes a new approach for image compression using auto encoders. The results are impressive, besting the state of the art in this field.
Pros:
+ Very clear paper. It should be possible to replicate these results should one be inclined to do so.
+ The results, when compared to other work in this field are very promising. I need to emphasize, and I think the authors should have emphasized this fact as well: this is very new technology and it should not be surprising it's not better than the state of the art in image compression. It's definitely better than other neural network approaches to compression, though.
Cons:
- The training procedure seems clunky. It requires multiple training stages, freezing weights, etc.
- The motivation behind Figure 1 is a bit strange, as it's not clear what it's trying to illustrate, and may confuse readers (it talks about effects on JPEG, but the paper discusses a neural network architecture, not DCT quantization)
