This paper proposes a novel method to learn vision feature as intermediate rewards to guide the robot training in the real world. Since there are only a few sequences of human demonstrations, the paper first segments the sequences into fragments so that the features are roughly invariant on the corresponding fragments across sequences, then clusters and finds most discriminative features on those fragments, and uses them as the reward function. The features are from pre-trained deep models.
The idea is simple and seems quite effective in picking the right reward functions. Fig. 6 is a good comparison (although it could be better with error bars). However, some baselines are not strong, in particular vision related baselines. For example, the random reward ("simply outputs true or false") in Tbl. 2 seems quite arbitrary and may not serve as a good baseline (but its performance is still not that bad, surprisingly.). A better baseline would be to use random/simpler feature extraction on the image, e.g., binning features and simply picking the most frequent ones, which might not be as discriminative as the proposed feature. I wonder whether a simpler vision-based approach would lead to a similarly performed reward function. If so, then these delicate steps (segment, etc) altogether.
