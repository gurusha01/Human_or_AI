The paper proposes to prune a neural network by removing neurons whose operation is highly correlated with other neurons. The idea is nice and somewhat novel - most pruning methods concentrate on removal of individual weights, however I haven't done a through research on this topic. However, the experimental and theoretical justification of this method need to be improved before publication:
1. Experiments. The authors do not report accuracy degradation while pruning in the tables, laconically stating that the networks did not degrade. This is not convincing. The only details are given in Figure 5, however this Figure disagrees with Table 2: in the Table, the number of parameters ranges from 40k-600k, while the Figure pictures the range 12k-24k. Unless more details are provided, simply claiming that a network can remove 50% neurons with no number on the degradation of accuracy is not convincing.
2. Theory. The proofs do not match the experimental conditions and make unreasonable assumptions. The proofs show that in the absence of biases a network with a constant output will have two correlated neurons that generate the output offset. However, this is exactly why networks have biases and doesn't explain why noise injection helps (the proof suggests that all should be fine with deterministic auxiliary neuron). My interpretation is that the noisy output injects gradient noise (see e.g. the concurrent ICLR submission
