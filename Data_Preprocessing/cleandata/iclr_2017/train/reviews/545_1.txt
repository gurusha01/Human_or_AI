This paper proposes a new learning model "Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs)" that extends the classic kernel machines by constructing compositional kernel functions using sum-product networks. This paper considers the convnets as nicely learned nonlinear decision functions and resort their success in classification to their compositional nature. This perspective motivates the design of compositional kernel functions and the sum-product implementation is indeed interesting. I agree the composition is important for convnets, but it is not the whole story of convnets' success. One essential difference between convnets and CKMs is that all the kernels in convnets are learned directly from data while CKMs still build on top of feature descriptors. This, I believe, limits the representation power of CKMs. A recent paper "Deep Convolutional Networks are Hierarchical Kernel Machines" by Anselmi, F. et al. seems to be interesting to the authors.
Experiments seem to be preliminary in this paper. It's good to see promising results of CKMs on small NORB, but it is quite important to show competitive results on recent classification standard benchmarks, such as MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and even Imagenet, in order to establish a novel learning model. In NORB compositions, CKMs seem to be better than convnets at classifying images by their dominant objects. I suspect it is because the use of sparse ORB features. It will be great if this paper could show the accuracy of ORB features with matching kernel SVMs. Some details about this experiment need further clarification, such as what are the high and low probabilities of sampling from each collections and how many images are generated. In NORB Symmetries, CKMs show better performance than convnets with small data, but the convnets seem not converged yet. Could it be possible to show results with larger dataset?
