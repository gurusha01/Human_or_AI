This paper proposes a method that attempts to "understand" what is happening within a neural network by using linear classifier probes which are inserted at various levels of the network.
I think the idea is nice overall because it allows network designers to better understand the representational power of each layer in the network, but at the same time, this works feels a bit rushed. In particular, the fact that the authors did not provide any results in "real" networks, which are used to win competitions makes the results less strong, since researchers who want to created competitive network architectures don't have enough evidence from this work to decides whether they should use it or not.
Ideally, I would encourage the authors to consider continuing this line of research and show how to use the information given by these linear classifiers to construct better network architectures. 
Unfortunately, as is, I don't think we have enough novelty to justify accepting this work in the conference.
