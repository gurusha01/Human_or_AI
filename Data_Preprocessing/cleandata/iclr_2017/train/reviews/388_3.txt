This paper proposed a dynamic coattention network for the question answering task with long contextual documents. 
The model is able to encode co-dependent representations of the question and the document, and a dynamic decoder iteratively pointing the potential answer spans to locate the final answer. 
Overall, this is a well-written paper. 
Although the model is a bit complicated (coattention encoder, iterative dynamic pointering decoder and highway maxout network), the intuitions behind and the details of the model are clearly presented. 
Also the performance on the SQuAD dataset is good. 
I would recommend this paper to be accepted.
