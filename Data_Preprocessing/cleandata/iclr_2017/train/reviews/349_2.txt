This paper introduces a nice dataset/data generator that creates bAbI like tasks, except where the questioning answering agent is required to clarify the values of some variables in order to succeed.  I think the baselines the authors use to test the tasks are appropriate.   I am a bit worried that the tasks may be too easy (as the bAbI tasks have been), but still, I think locally these will be useful.  If the generation code is well written, and the tasks are extensible, they may be useful for some time.
