The paper proposes a convergence analysis of some two-layer NNs with ReLUs. It is not the first such analysis, but maybe it is novel on the assumptions used in the analysis, and the focus on ReLU nonlinearity that is pretty popular in practice. 
The paper is quite hard to read, with many English mistakes and typos. Nevertheless, the analysis seems to be generally correct. The novelty and the key insights are however not always well motivated or presented. And the argument that the work uses realistic assumptions (Gaussian inputs for example) as opposed to other works, is quite debatable actually. 
Overall, the paper looks like a correct analysis work, but its form is really suboptimal in terms of writing/presentation, and the novelty and relevance of the results are not always very clear, unfortunately. The main results and intuition should be more clearly presented, and details could be moved to appendices for example - that could only help to improve the visibility and impact of these interesting results.
