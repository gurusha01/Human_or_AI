The authors propose to add noise to the gradients computed while optimizing deep neural networks with stochastic gradient based methods. They show results multiple data sets which indicate that the method can counteract bad parameter initialization and that it can be especially beneficial for training more complicated architectures.
The method is tested on a multitude of different tasks and architectures. The results would be more convincing if they would be accompanied by confidence intervals but I understand that some of the experiments must have taken very long to run. I like that the results include both situations in which the gradient noise helps a lot and situations in which it doesn't seem to add much to the other optimization or initialization tools employed. The quantity of the experiments and the variety of the models provide quite convincing evidence that the effect of the gradient noise generalizes to many settings. The results were not always that convincing. In Section 4.2, the method only helped significantly when a sub-optimal training scheme was used, for example. The results on MNIST are not very good compared to the state-of-the-art. Since the method is so simple, I was hoping to see more theoretical arguments for its usefulness. That said, the experimental investigations into the importance of the annealing procedure, the comparison with the effect of gradient stochasticity and the comparison with weight noise, provide some additional insight.
The paper is well written and cites relevant prior work. The proposed method is described clearly and concisely, which is to be expected given its simplicity. 
The proposed idea is not very original. As the authors acknowledge, very similar algorithms have been used for training and it is pretty much identical to simulating Langevin dynamics but with the goal of finding a single optimum in mind rather than approximating an expected value. The work is the evaluation of an old tool in a new era where models have become bigger and more complex.
Despite the lack of novelty of the method, I do think that the results are valuable. The method is so easy to implement and seems to be so useful for complicated model which are hard to initialize, that it is important for others in the field to know about it. I suspect many people will at least try the method. The variety of the architectures and tasks for which the method was useful suggests that many people may also add it to their repertoire of optimization tricks.
