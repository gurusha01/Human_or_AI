The paper addresses an important problem - namely on how to improve diversity in responses. It is applaudable that the authors show results on several tasks showing the applicability across different problems. 
In my view there are two weaknesses at this point
1) the improvements (for essentially all tasks) seem rather minor and do not really fit the overall claim of the paper
2) the approach seems quite ad hoc and it unclear to me if this is something that will and should be widely adopted. Having said this the gist of the proposed solution seems interesting but somewhat premature.
