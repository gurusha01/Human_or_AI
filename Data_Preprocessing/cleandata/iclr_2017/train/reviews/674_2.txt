The authors propose a theoretical framework to analyze the recoverability of sparse activations in intermediate layers of deep networks, using theoretical tools from compressed sensing. They relate the computations that are performed by a CNN and a particular recovery algorithm (Iterative Hard Thresholding, IHT). They present proofs of necessary conditions for recoverability to hold, and also show detailed empirical evidence of how they hold in practice.
This is a well-written paper that presents a new angle on why the current CNN architectures work so well. The authors give a brief but sufficient review of the fundamentals of compressed sensing, present their main result relating feed-forward networks and IHT (a surprising result), and progress naturally to a detailed experimental section. The introductory analysis at the beginning of Section 3, in particular, delivers the gist of why the method should work with very approachable and simple math, which is not common in theoretical papers. The increasing complexity of the experiments, done in small steps, shows a nice progression from artificial distributions to a realistic experiment.
A few aspects should be improved. First of all, although the treatment of ReLU non-linearities is sufficient, it is assumed with little discussion that max-pooling non-linearities shouldn't present a problem as well. A discussion of how this is inverted (e.g., with pooling switches) is needed.
The relationship between feed-forward nets and Algorithm 1 assumes tied weights. It might be worthwhile to mention that the result is stronger for the case of RNNs, where this is the case by design.
Although it might be obvious, it might help some readers to briefly note that the reconstruction algorithm is meant to be applied to each layer sequentially, basing the activations of each layer on the one above it (in back-propagation order).
Finally, the filter coherence measure must be defined either mathematically or with a proper reference.
