This paper proposes a new method for estimating visual attention in videos. The input clip is first processed by a convnet (in particular, C3D) to extract visual features. The visual features are then passed to LSTM. The hidden state at each time step in LSTM is used to generate the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, the visual attention map is generated from the Gaussian mixture model.
Overall, the idea in this paper is reasonable and the paper is well written. RNN/LSTM has been used in lots of vision problem where the outputs are discrete sequences, there has not been much work on using RNN/LSTM for problems where the output is continuous like in this paper.
The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, it outperforms other state-of-the-art on the saliency prediction task on the Hollywood2 datasets. It also shows improvement over baselines (e.g. C3D + SVM) on the action recognition task.
My only "gripe" of this paper is that this paper is missing some important baseline comparisons. In particular, it does not seem to show how the "recurrent" part help the overall performance. Although Table 2 shows RMDN outperforms other state-of-the-art, it might be due to the fact that it uses strong C3D features (while other methods in Table 2 use traditional handcrafted features). Since saliency prediction is essentially a dense image labeling problem (similar to semantic segmentation). For dense image labeling, there has been lots of methods proposed in the past two years, e.g. fully convolution neural network (FCN) or deconvnet. A straightforward baseline is to simply take FCN and apply it on each frame. If the proposed method still outperforms this baseline, we can know that the "recurrent" part really helps.
