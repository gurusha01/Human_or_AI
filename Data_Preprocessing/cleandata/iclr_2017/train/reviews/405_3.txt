The authors propose a recurrent neural network architecture that is able to output more accurate long-term predictions of several game environments than the current state-of-the-art.
The original network architecture was inspired by inability of previous methods to accurately predict many time-steps into the future,
and their inability to jump directly to a future prediction without iterating through all intermediate states.
The authors have provided an extensive experimental evaluation on several benchmarks with promising results.
In general the paper is well written and quite clear in its explanations.
Demonstrating that this kind of future state prediction is useful for 3D maze exploration is a plus.
Minor comments:
`jumpy predictions have been developed in low-dimensional observation spaces' - cite relevant work in the paper.
