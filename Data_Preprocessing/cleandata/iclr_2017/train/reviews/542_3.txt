The paper proposes a new RL architecture that aims at learning policies from sketches i.e sequence of high-level operations to execute for solving a particular task. The model relies on a hierarchical structure where the sub-policy is chosen depending on the current operation to execute in the sketch . The learning algorithm is based on an extension of the actor-critic model for that particular case, and also involves curriculum learning techniques when the task to solve is hard. Experimental results are provided on different learning problems and compared to baseline methods. 
The paper is well-written and very easy to follow. I am not really convinced by the impact of such a paper since the problem solved here can be seen as an option-learning problem with a richer supervision (i.e the sequence of option is given). It thus corresponds to an easier problem with a limited impact. Moreover, I do not really understand to which concrete application this setting corresponds. For example, learning from natural langage instructions is clearly more relevant. So since the model proposed in this article is not a major contribution and shares many common ideas with existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods,  the paper lacks a strong motivation and/or concrete application. So, the paper only has a marginal interest for the RL community
@pros: 
* Original problem with well design experiments
* Simple adaptation of the actor-critic method to the problem of learning sub policies
@cons:
* Very simple task that can be seen as a simplification of more complex problems like options discovery, hierarchical RL or learning from instructions
* No strong underlying applications that could help to 'reinforce' the interest of the approach
