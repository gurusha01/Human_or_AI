This paper proposes a k-shot learning framework that can be used on existing pre-trained networks by grouping filters that produce similar activations. The grouped filters are learned together to address overfitting when only few training samples are available. 
The idea of the paper is interesting there are some encouraging results, but the current version doesn't seem ready for publication:
Performance:
The method should be compared with other state-of-the-art k-shot learning methods (e.g., Matching Networks by Vinyals et al., 2016). It's not clear how this method compares against them.
Missing explanation:
Experimental setting for k-shot learning should be more detailed.
Measure:
Accuracy difference does not look like a good idea for comparing the baseline method and the proposed one. Just raw accuracies would be fine. 
Many grammatical errors and inappropriate formatting of citations, such as:
