The main contribution of this paper seems to be an introduction of a set of differential graph transformations which will allow you to learn graph->graph classification tasks using gradient descent. This maps naturally to a task of learning a cellular automaton represented as sequence of graphs. In that task, the graph of nodes grows at each iteration, with nodes pointing to neighbors and special nodes 0/1 representing the values. Proposed architecture allows one to learn this sequence of graphs, although in the experiment, this task (Rule 30) was far from solved.
This idea is combined with ideas from previous papers (GGS-NN) to allow the model to produce textual output rather than graph output, and use graphs as intermediate representation, which allows it to beat state of the art on BaBi tasks.
