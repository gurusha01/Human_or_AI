Paper Strengths: 
-- Elegant use of MoE for expanding model capacity and enabling training large models necessary for exploiting  very large datasets in a computationally feasible manner
-- The effective batch size for training the MoE drastically increased also
-- Interesting experimental results on the effects of increasing the number of MoEs, which is expected.
Paper Weaknesses:
--- there are many different ways of increasing model capacity to enable the exploitation of very large datasets; it would be very nice to discuss  the use of MoE and other alternatives in terms of computational efficiency and other factors.
