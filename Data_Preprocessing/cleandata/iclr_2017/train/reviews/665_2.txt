This is a dataset paper that brings unique values over existing reading comprehension challenges. Unlike others, MS MARCO is derived from query logs, thus represents real questions that people ask, rather than solicited questions that might be rather artificial in practical settings.
There are potential downsides of using query logs however. It may be that people adapt their language and questions for search engines such that users ask questions that they know current search engines can reasonably answer. Thus, it may be that people limit the complexity of questions or language or both. I think authors could have addressed this concern by being more selective about the query logs, by down-sampling on simple questions that can be easily answered by keyword matching without any sophisticated reading comprehension, and up-sampling more complex questions that require at least paraphrasing and ideally synthesis of information taken from more than one sentences.
It's great that there are several new efforts to construct large-scale reading comprehension challenges, but my main concern is whether the majority of the questions can be answered through relatively easy text matching without intelligent reading or reasoning.
Also, the paper reads like the authors were running out of time before the deadline. I would appreciate more analytic and quantitative comparisons against other existing datasets, and more insights on the degree of challenges required to handle QAs in MS MARCO. For example, the authors could collect statistics on QAs: (1) exact match exists in the text snippet, (2) paraphrasing is required but otherwise the relevant answer is directly available in the text snippet, (3) requires synthesizing information taken from more than one sentences, (4) requires external knowledge. The author response mentions that (4) is unlikely, but a more formal and complete analysis would be helpful.
