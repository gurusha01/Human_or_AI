This paper presents iterative PoWER, an off-policy variation on PoWER, a policy gradient algorithm in the reward-weighted family.
I'm not familiar enough with this type lower bound scheme to comment on it. It looks like the end result is less conservative step sizes in policy parameter space. All expectation-based algorithms (and their KL-regularized cousins a-la TRPO) take smallish steps, and this might be a sensible way to accelerate them.
The description of the experiments in Section VI is insufficient for reproducibility. Is "The cart moved right" supposed to be "a positive force is applied to the cart"? How is negative force applied? What is the representation of the state? What is the distribution of initial states? A linear policy is insufficient for swing up and balance of a cart-pole. Are you only doing balancing? What is the noise magnitude of the policy? How was it chosen? How long were the episodes?
The footnote at the bottom of page 8 threw me off. If you're using Newton's method, where is the discussion of gradients and Hessians? I thought the argmax_theta operator was a stand-in for an EM-style step, which I how I read Eq (8) in the Kober paper.
