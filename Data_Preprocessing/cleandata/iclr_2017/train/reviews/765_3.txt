The topic of the paper, model-based RL with a learned model, is important and timely. The paper is well written. I feel that the presented results are too incremental. Augmenting the frame prediction network with another head that predicts the reward is a very sensible thing to do. However neither the methodology not the results are novel / surprising, given that the original method of [Oh et al. 2015] already learns to successfully increment score counters in predicted frames in many games.
I'm very much looking forward to seeing the results of applying the learned joint model of frames and rewards to model-based RL as proposed by the authors.
