In this paper, the authors propose to pretrain the encoder/decoder of seq2seq models on a large amount of unlabeled data using a LM objective. They obtain improvements using this technique on machine translation and abstractive summarization.
While the effectiveness of pretraining seq2seq models has been known among researchers and explored in a few papers (e.g. Zoph et al. 2016,  Dai and Le 2015), I believe this is the first paper to pretrain using a LM for both the encoder/decoder. The technique is simple, but the gains are large (e.g. +2.7 BLEU on NMT). In addition, the authors perform extensive ablation studies to analyze where the performance is coming from. Hence, I think this paper should be accepted.
