This paper aims to provide an insightful and analytic survey over the recent literature on reading comprehension with the distinct goal of investigating whether logical structure (or predication, as the authors rephrased in their response) arises in many of the recent models. I really like the spirit of the paper and appreciate the efforts to organize rather chaotic recent literature into two unified themes: "aggregation readers" and "explicit reference models". Overall the quality of writing is great and section 3 was especially nice to read. I'm also happy with the proposed rewording from "logical structure" to "predication", and the clarification by the authors was detailed and helpful.
I think I still have slight mixed feelings about the contribution of the work. First, I wonder whether the choice of the dataset was ideal in the first place to accomplish the desired goal of the paper. There have been concerns about CNN/DailyMail dataset (Chen et al. ACL'16) and it is not clear to me whether the dataset supports investigation on logical structure of interesting kinds. Maybe it is bound to be rather about lack of logical structure.
Second, I wish the discussion on predication sheds more practical insights into dataset design or model design to better tackle reading comprehension challenges. In that sense, it may have been more helpful if the authors could make more precise analysis on different types of reading comprehension challenges, what types of logical structure are lacking in various existing models and datasets, and point to specific directions where the community needs to focus more.
