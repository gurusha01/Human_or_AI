I really appreciate the directions the authors are taken and I think something quite interesting can come out of it. I hope the authors continue on this path and are able to come up with something quite interesting soon. However I feel this paper right now is not quite ready. Is not clear to me what the results of this work are yet. The preimage construction is not obviously (at least not to me) helpful. It feels like the right direction, but it didn't got to a point where we can use it to identify the underlying mechanism behind our models. We know relu models need to split apart and unite different region of the space, and I think we can agree that we can construct such mechanism (it comes from the fact that relu models are universal approximators) .. though this doesn't speak to what happens in practice.  All in all I think this work needs a bit more work yet.
