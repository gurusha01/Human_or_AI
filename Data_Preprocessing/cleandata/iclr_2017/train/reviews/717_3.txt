This paper attempts to understand and visualize what deep nets are representing as one ascends from low levels to high levels of the network.  As has been shown previously, lower levels are more local image feature based, whereas higher levels correspond to abstract properties such as object identity.  In semantic space, we find higher level nodes to be more semantically selective, whereas low level nodes are more diffuse.
This seems like a good attempt to tease apart deep net representations.  Perhaps the most important finding is that color figures prominently into all levels of the network, and that performance on gray scale images is significantly diminished.  The new NF measure proposed here is sensible, but still based on the images shown to the network.  What one really wants to know is what function these nodes are computing - i.e., out of the space of all possible images, which most activate a unit?  Of course this is a difficult problem, but it would be nice to see us getting closer to understanding the answer.  The color analysis here I think brings us a bit closer.  The semantic analysis is nice but I'm not sure what new insight we gain from this.
