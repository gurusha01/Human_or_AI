The authors present methods to speed-up gradient descent by leveraging asynchronicity in a layer-wise manner.
While they obtain up-to 1.7x speedup compared to synchronous training, their baseline is weak. More importantly, they dismiss parameter-server based methods, which are becoming standard, and so effectively just do not compare to the current state-of-the-art. They also do not present wall-time measurements. With these flaws, the paper is not ready for ICLR acceptance.
