Very good paper, I hope it will be accepted. I keep my original evaluation.
This is a strong submission regarding one of the most important and recently introduced methods in neural networks - generative adversarial networks. The authors analyze theoretically the convergence of GANs and discuss the stability of GANs. Both are very important. To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the first theoretical papers about GANs and the paper, contrary to most of the submissions in the field, actually provides deep theoretical insight into this architecture. The stability issues regarding GANs are extremely important since the first proposed versions of GANs architecture were very unstable and did not work well in practice. Theorems 2.4-2.6 are novel and introduces mathematical techniques are interesting. I have some technical questions regarding the proof of Theorem 2.5 but these are pretty minor.
