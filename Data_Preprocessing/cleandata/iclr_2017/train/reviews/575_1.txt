It is not clear to me at all what this paper is contributing. Deep CCA (Andrew et al, 2013) already gives the gradient derivation of the correlation objective with respect to the network outputs which are then back-propagated to update the network weights. Again, the paper gives the gradient of the correlation (i.e. the CCA objective) w.r.t. the network outputs, so it is confusing to me when authors say that their differentiable version enables them to back-propagate directly through the computation of CCA.
