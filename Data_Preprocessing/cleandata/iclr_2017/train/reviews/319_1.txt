The paper proposes a new way of transferring knowledge.
I like the idea of transferring attention maps instead of activations.
However, the experiments don't show a big improvement compared with knowledge distillation alone and I think more experiments are required in IMAGENET section.
I would consider updating the score if the authors extend the last section 4.2.2.
