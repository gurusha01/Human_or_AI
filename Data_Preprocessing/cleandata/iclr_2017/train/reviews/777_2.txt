The paper presents a new regularization technique for neural networks, which seeks to maximize correlation between input variables, latent variables and outputs. This is achieved by defining a measure of total correlation between these variables and decomposing it in terms of entropies and conditional entropies.
Authors explain that they do not actually maximize the total correlation, but a lower-bound of it that ignores simple entropy terms, and only considers conditional entropies. It is not clearly explained what is the rationale for discarding these entropy terms.
Entropies measures are applying to probability distributions (i.e. this implies that the variables in the model should be random). The link between the conditional entropy formulation and the reconstruction error is not made explicit. In order to link these two views, I would have expected, for example, a noise model for the units of the network.
Later in the paper, it is claimed that the original ladder network is not suitable for supervised learning with small samples, and some empirical results seek to demonstrate this. But a more theoretical explanation why it is the case would have been welcome.
The MNIST results are shown for a particular convolutional neural network architecture, however, most ladder network results for this dataset have been produced on standard fully-connected architectures. Results for such neural network architecture would have been desirable for more comparability with original ladder neural network results.
