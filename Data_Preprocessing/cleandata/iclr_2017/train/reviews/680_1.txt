* Summary: This paper proposes a neural machine translation model that translates the source and the target texts in an end to end manner from characters to characters. The model can learn morphology in the encoder and in the decoder the authors use a hierarchical decoder. Authors provide very compelling results on various bilingual corpora for different language pairs. The paper is well-written, the results are competitive compared to other baselines in the literature.
* Review:
     - I think the paper is very well written, I like the analysis presented in this paper. It is clean and precise. 
     - The idea of using hierarchical decoders have been explored before, e.g. [1]. Can you cite those papers?
     - This paper is mainly an application paper and it is mainly the application of several existing components on the character-level NMT tasks. In this sense, it is good that authors made their codes available online. However, the contributions from the general ML point of view is still limited.
                   
* Some Requests:
 -Can you add the size of the models to the Table 1? 
- Can you add some of the failure cases of your model, where the model failed to translate correctly?
* An Overview of the Review:
Pros:
    - The paper is well written
    - Extensive analysis of the model on various language pairs
    - Convincing experimental results.    
    
Cons:
    - The model is complicated.
    - Mainly an architecture engineering/application paper(bringing together various well-known techniques), not much novelty.
    - The proposed model is potentially slower than the regular models since it needs to operate over the characters instead of the words and uses several RNNs.
