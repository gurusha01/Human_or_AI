The work introduced a new form of regularization for denoising autoencoders, which explicitly enforces robustness in the encoding phrase w.r.t. input perturbation. The author motivates the regularization term as minimizing the conditional entropy of the encoding given the input. The modifier denoising autoencoders is evaluated on some synthetic datasets as well as MNIST, along with regular auto-encoders and denoising autoencoders. The work is fairly similar to several existing extensions to auto-encoders, e.g., contractive auto encoders, which the author did not include in the comparison.   The experiment section needs more polishing. More details should be provided to help understand the figures in the section.
