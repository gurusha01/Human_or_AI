The paper proposes a modified DAE objective where it is the mapped representation of the corrupted input that is pushed closer to the representation of the uncorrupted input. This thus borrows from both denoising (DAE) for the stochasticity and from the contractive (CAE) auto-encoders objectives (which the paper doesn't compare to) for the representational closeness, and as such appears rather incremental. In common with the CAE, a collapse of the representation can only be avoided by additional external constraints, such as tied weights, batch normalization or other normalization heuristics. While I appreciates that the authors added a paragraph discussing this point and the usual remediations after I had raised it in an earlier question, I think it would deserve a proper formal treatment. Note that such external constraints do not seem to arise from the information-theoretic formalism as articulated by the authors. This casts doubt regarding the validity or completeness of the proposed formal motivation as currently exposed.  What the extra regularization does from an information-theoretic perspective remains unclearly articulated (e.g. interpretation of lambda strength?).
On the experimental front, empirical support for the approach is very weak: few experiments on synthetic and small scale data. The modified DAE's test errors on MNIST are larger than those of Original DAE all the time expect for one precise setting of lambda, and then the original DAE performance is still within the displayed error-bar of the modified DAE. So, it is unclear whether the improvement is actually statistically significant.
