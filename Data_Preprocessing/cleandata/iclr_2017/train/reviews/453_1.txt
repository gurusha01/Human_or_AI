This paper proposed a proximal (quasi-) Newton's method to learn binary DNN. The main contribution is to combine pre-conditioning with binarization in a proximal framework. It is interesting to have a proximal Newton's method to interpret the different DNN binarization schemes. This gives a new interpretation of existing approaches. However, the theoretical analysis is not very convincing or useful. The formulated optimization problem (3)-(4) is essentially a mixed integer programming. Even though the paper treats the integer part as a constraint and address it in proximal operators, the constraint set is still discrete and there is no guarantee that the proximal Newton algorithm could converge under practically useful conditions. In practice it is hard to verify the assumption [dt^t]k > \beta in Theorem 3.1. This relation could be hard to hold in DNN as the loss surface could be extremely complicated.
