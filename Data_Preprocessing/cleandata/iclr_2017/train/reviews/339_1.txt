The authors present a simple method to affix a cache to neural language models, which provides in effect a copying mechanism from recently used words. Unlike much related work in neural networks with copying mechanisms, this mechanism need not be trained with long-term backpropagation, which makes it efficient and scalable to much larger cache sizes. They demonstrate good improvements on language modeling by adding this cache to RNN baselines.
The main contribution of this paper is the observation that simply using the hidden states hi as keys for words xi, and h_t as the query vector, naturally gives a lookup mechanism that works fine without tuning by backprop. This is a simple observation and might already exist as folk knowledge among some people, but it has nice implications for scalability and the experiments are convincing.
The basic idea of repurposing locally-learned representations for large-scale attention where backprop would normally be prohibitively expensive is an interesting one, and could probably be used to improve other types of memory networks.
My main criticism of this work is its simplicity and incrementality when compared to previously existing literature. As a simple modification of existing NLP models, but with good empirical success, simplicity and practicality, it is probably more suitable for an NLP-specific conference. However, I think that approaches that distill recent work into a simple, efficient, applicable form should be rewarded and that this tool will be useful to a large enough portion of the ICLR community to recommend its publication.
