This paper proposed to use unsupervised learning to learn features in a reinforcement learning setting. It is unclear what "unsupervised" means here since the "causality prior" uses reward signals for training. This is reinforcement learning, not unsupervised learning.
The experiments are also very premature. The task is as simple as moving the head of the robot left or right. There is also no comparison to baselines.
In conclusions section, the authors claim the proposed method can be used for transfer learning without experiments to backup the claim.
Overall this paper is confusing and premature.
