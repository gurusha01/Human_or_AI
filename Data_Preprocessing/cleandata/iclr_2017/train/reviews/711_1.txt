This paper proposes RaSoR, a method to efficiently representing and scoring all possible spans in an extractive QA task. While the test set results on SQuAD have not been released, it looks likely that they are not going to be state-of-the-art; with that said, the idea of enumerating all possible spans proposed in this paper could potentially improve many architectures. The paper is very well-written and the analysis/ablations in the final sections are mostly interesting (especially Figure 2, which confirms what we would intuitively believe). Based on its potential to positively impact other researchers working on SQuAD, I recommend that the paper is accepted.
