This paper proposes to use previous error signal of the output layer as an additional input to recurrent update function in order to enhance the modelling power of a dynamic system such as RNNs. 
-This paper makes an  erroneous assumption: test label information is not given in most of the real world applications, except few applications. This means that the language modelling task, which is the only experiment of this paper, may not be the right task to test this approach. Also, comparing against the models that do not use test error signal at inference time is unfair. We cannot just say that the test label information is being observed, this only holds in online-prediction problems.
-The experiment is only conducted on one dataset, reporting state-of-the-art result, but unfortunately this is not true. There are already more than four papers reporting better numbers than the one reported in this task, however the author did not cite them. I understand that this paper came before the other papers, but the manuscript should be updated before the final decision.
-The model size is still missing and without this information, it is hard to judge the contribution of the proposed trick.
