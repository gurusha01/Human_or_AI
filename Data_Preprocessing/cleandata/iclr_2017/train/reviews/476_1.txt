Description.
This paper describes experiments testing whether deep convolutional networks can be replaced with shallow networks with the same number of parameters without loss of accuracy. The experiments are performed on he CIFAR 10 dataset where deep convolutional teacher networks are used to train shallow student networks using L2 regression on logit outputs.  The results show that similar accuracy on the same parameter budget can be only obtained when multiple layers of convolution are used. 
Strong  points.
- The experiments are carefully done with thorough selection of hyperparameters. 
- The paper shows interesting results that go partially against conclusions from the previous work in this area (Ba and Caruana 2014).
- The paper is well and clearly written.
Weak points:
- CIFAR is still somewhat toy dataset with only 10 classes. It would be interesting to see some results on a more challenging problem such as ImageNet. Would the results for a large number of classes be similar?
Originality:
- This is mainly an experimental paper, but the question it asks is interesting and worth investigation. The experimental results are solid and provide new insights.
Quality:
- The experiments are well done.
Clarity:
- The paper is well written and clear.
Significance:
- The results go against some of the conclusions from previous work, so should be published and discussed.
Overall:
Experimental paper with interesting results. Well written. Solid experiments.
