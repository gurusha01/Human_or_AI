I'd like to sincerely thank all the authors for clarifications. Unfortunately I still think that it is a strong reject paper. Authors' responses did not solve main problems that I pointed out. This paper is badly written, the results are incremental and presented in the unclear way. The proofs are presented in such a way that I cannot really verify whether proposed theoretical claims (which to the best of my understanding constitute the core of the paper) are correct even though I consider myself to be very familiar with the mathematical tools used here.
The authors should consider submitting this paper to a journal, but after a major revision.
This is an incremental result (several related results that the authors of the paper mentioned here were already published). The authors claim that they can get rid of the technical assumptions from the previous papers but the results they propose are significantly weaker and also quite technical. The main theoretical result - Theorem 2.4 is not convincing at all. Furthermore, the paper is badly written. No theoretical intuition is given, the experimental section is weak and in some places the formatting is wrong.
