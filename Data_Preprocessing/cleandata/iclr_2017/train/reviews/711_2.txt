This paper presents an architecture for answer extraction task and evaluates on the SQUAD dataset. The proposed model builds fixed length representations of all spans in the answer document based on recurrent neural network. It outperforms a few baselines in exact match and F1 on SQUAD.
It is unfortunate that the blind test results are not obtained yet due to the copyright issue. There are quite a few other systems/submissions on the SQUAD leader board that were available for comparison.
Given that there's no result on the test set reported, the grid search for hyperparameters on the dev set directly is also a concern, even though the authors did cross validation experiments.
