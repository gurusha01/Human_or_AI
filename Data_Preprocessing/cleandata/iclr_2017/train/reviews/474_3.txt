This paper proposes an interesting framework (as a follow-up work of the author's previous paper) to learn compositional rules used to compose better music. The system consists of two components, a generative component (student) and a discriminative component (teacher). The generative component is a Probabilistic Graphical Models, generating the music following learned rules. The teacher compares the generated music with the empirical distribution of exemplar music (e.g, Bach's chorales) and propose new rules for the student to learn so that it could improve.
The framework is different from GANs that the both the generative and discriminative components are interpretable. From the paper, it seems that the system can indeed learn sensible rules from the composed music and apply them in the next iteration, if trained in a curriculum manner. However, there is no comparison between the proposed system and its previous version, nor comparison between the proposed system and other simple baselines, e.g., an LSTM generative model. This might pose a concern here. 
I found this paper a bit hard to read, partly due to (1) lots of music terms (e.g, Tbl. 1 does not make sense to me) that hinders understanding of how the system performs, and (2) over-complicated math symbols and concept. For example, In Page 4, the concept of raw/high-level feature, Feature-Induced Partition and Conceptual Hierarchy, all means a non-overlapping hierarchical clustering on the 4-dimensional feature space. Also, there seems to be no hierarchy in Informational Hierarchy, but a list of rules. It would be much clearer if the authors write the paper in a plain way. 
Overall, the paper proposes a working system that seems to be interesting. But I am not confident enough to give strong conclusions.
