This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution on x,z is then modeled using a joint generator model p(x,z)=p(z)p(x|z).  Both q and p are then trained by trying to fool a discriminator. This constitutes a worthwhile extension of GANs: giving GANs the ability to do inference opens up many applications that could previously only be addressed by e.g. VAEs.
The results are very promising. The CIFAR-10 samples are the best I've seen so far (not counting methods that use class labels). Matching the semi-supervised results from Salimans et al. without feature matching also indicates the proposed method may improve the stability of training GANs.
