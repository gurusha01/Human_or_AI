This paper presents a thorough analysis of different methods to do curriculum learning. The major issue I have with it is that the dataset used seems very specific and does not necessarily justified, as mentioned by AnonReviewer3. It would have been great to see experiments on more standard tasks. Also, I really can't understand how the performance of FFNN models can be so good, please elaborate on this (see last comment).
However, the paper is well written, the comparisons of the described methods are interesting and would probably apply to some other datasets as well.
The paper is way too long (18 pages!). Please reduce it or move some of the results to an appendix section.
The method described is extremely similar to the one described in Reinforcement learning neural turing machines (Zaremba et al., 2016,
