This paper studies knowledge transfer problem from small capacity network to bigger one. This is a follow-up work of Net2Net (ICLR 2015) and NetMorph(ICML 2016).

- 1) This paper studies macroscopic problem, with the morphing process composed by multiple atomic operations. While the atomic operations are proposed in Net2Net and NetMorph, there has not been study of the general modularized process principally. Thus this paper asks a novel question.
- 2) The solution by composing multiple atomic transformations seems to be quite reasonable.
- 3) In the "related work" section, it is better to change "network morphism" to "knowledge transfer" or in the subsection title, most of these works are known as knowledge transfer and it helps to connect to the existing works.
- 4) The author shows experiments on variants of ResNet. While the experiment shows that initializing from ResNet gives better error rate than the ones trained from scratch, it is unclear what the source This paper studies knowledge transfer problem from small capacity network to bigger one.

- 5) One major advantage of this type of knowledge transfer (Net2Net, NetMorph) is to speedup training and model exploration. There seems to be no experiments demonstrate such advantage (possibly due to the lose initialization of BatchNorm). This is the major drawback of this paper.
-6)  The method proposed by the author can in principle do quite complicated transformation, e.g. transform  an entire resnet from a single conv layer, the experiment only consists of simple module transformations, which in some way can be covered by atomic operations. It would be more interesting to see what the results of more complicated transformations are (even if they are not as effective). 
In summary, this paper studies a novel problem of knowledge transfer in a macroscopic level. The method could be of interest to the ICLR community. The experiments should be improved (comment 5) to make the results more convincing and practically useful and I strongly encourage the authors to do so.
