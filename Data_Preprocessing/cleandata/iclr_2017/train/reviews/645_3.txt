The proposed method is simple and elegant; it builds upon the huge success of gradient based optimization for deep non-linear function approximators and combines it with established (linear) many-view CCA methods. A major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the gradients with respect to the non-linear encoding networks which project the different views into a common space. The derivation seems correct. In general this approach seems very interesting and I could imagine that it might be applicable to many other similarly structured problems.
The paper is well written; but it could be enhanced with an explicit description of the complete algorithm which also highlights how the joint embeddings G and U are updated. 
 
I don't have prior experience with CCA-style many-view techniques and it is therefore hard for me to judge the practical/empirical progress presented here. But the experiments seem reasonable convincing; although generally only performed on small and medium sized datasets.
  
Detailed comments: 
The colours or the sign of the x-axis in figure 3b seem to be flipped compared to figure 4.
  
It would be nice to additionally see a continuous (rainbow-coloured) version for Figures 2, 3 and 4 to better identify neighbouring datapoints; but more importantly: I'd like to see how the average reconstruction error between the individual network outputs and the learned representation develop during training.  Is the mismatch between different views on a validation/test-set a useful metric for cross validation? In general, it seems the method is sensitive to regularization and hyperparameter selection  (because it has many more parameters compared to GCCA and different regularization parameters have been chosen for different views) and I wonder if there is a clear metric to optimize these.
