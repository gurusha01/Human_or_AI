The paper presents a new exciting layerwise origin-target synthesis method both for generating a large number of diverse adversarials as well as for understanding the robustness of various layers. The methodology is then used to visualize the amount of perturbation necessary for producing a change for higher level features.
The approach to match the features of another unrelated image is interesting and it goes beyond producing adversarials for classification. It can also generate adversarials for face-recognition and other models where the result is matched with some instance from a database.
Pro: The presented approach is definitely sound, interesting and original. 
Con: The analyses presented in this paper are relatively shallow and don't touch the most obvious questions. There is not much experimental quantitative evidence for the efficacy of this method compared with other approaches to produce adversarials. The visualization is not very exciting and it is hard to any draw any meaningful conclusions from them.
It would definitely improve the paper if it would present some interesting conclusions based on the new ideas.
