I would definitely love to have this and use it for my research. A great tool.
However, the paper lacks detail. In particular, I feel that it is impossible for someone to reimplement the research-mostly because of the lack of detail. However, replicability is a crucial part of science. Other publications proposing software (e.g. the tensorflow, theano and edward papers) come along with open source code. This is not the case here and therefore the picture is quite incomplete.
I am not convinced that ICLR is the right venue: robotics conferences such as IROS and ICRA might appreciate it much more. Nevertheless, this is just an encouragement to the authors to interact with those communities.
