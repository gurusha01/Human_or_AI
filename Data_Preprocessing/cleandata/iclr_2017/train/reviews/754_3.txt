This paper takes a standard auto-regressive model of source code and augments it with a fixed attention policy that tracks the use of certain token types, like identifiers. Additionally they release a Python open source dataset. As expected this augmentation, the fixed attention policy, improves the perplexity of the model. It seems important to dig a bit deeper into these results and show the contribution of different token types to the achieve perplexity. This is alluded to in the text, but a more thorough comparison would be welcome. The idea of an attention policy that takes advantage of expert knowledge is a nice contribution, but perhaps if limited novelty --- for example the Maddison and Tarlow 2014 paper, which the authors cite, has scoping rules that track previously used identifiers in scope.
