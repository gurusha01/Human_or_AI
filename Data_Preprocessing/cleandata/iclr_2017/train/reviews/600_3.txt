This paper propose to classify questions by leveraging corresponding answers. The proposed method uses group sparse autoencoders to model question groups.
The proposed method offers improved accuracy over baselines. But the baseline used is a little stale. Would be interesting to see how it compares to more recent CNN and RNN based methods. It would also be interesting to see the contribution of each components. For example, how much GSA contributed to the improvement.
