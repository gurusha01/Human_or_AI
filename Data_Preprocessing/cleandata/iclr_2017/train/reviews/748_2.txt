This paper is the first (I believe) to establish a simple yet important result that Convnets for NMT encoders can be competitive to RNNs. The authors present a convincing set of results over many translation tasks and compare with very competitive baselines. I also appreciate the detailed report on training and generation speed. I find it's very interesting when position embeddings turn out to be hugely important (beside residual connections); unfortunately, there is little analysis to shed more lights on this aspect and perhaps compare other ways of capturing positions (a wild guess might be to use embeddings that represent some form of relative positions). The only concern I have (similar to the other reviewer) is that this paper perhaps fits better in an NLP conference.
One minor comment: it's slight strange that this well-executed paper doesn't have a single figure on the proposed architecture :) It will also be even better to draw a figure for the biLSTM architecture as well (it does take some effort to understand the last paragraph in Section 2, especially the part on having a linear layer to compute z).
