This paper proposes a network called Gated Residual Networks layer design that adds gating to shortcut connections with a scalar to regulate the gate. The authors claim that this approach will improve the training Residual Networks.
It seems the authors could get competitive performance on CIFAR-10 to state of art models with only Wide Res Nets. Wide Gated ResNet requires much more parameters than DenseNet (and other Res Net variants) for obtaining a little improvement over Dense Net.  More importantly, the authors state that they obtained the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 but the updated version of DenseNet (Huang et al. (2016b)) has new results for a version called DenseNet-BC which outperforms all of the results that authors reported (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, DenseNet-BC still outperforms with 15.3M parameters which is much less that 36.5M). The Res Net variants papers with state of art results report result for Image Net. Therefore the empirical results need also the Image Net to demonstrate that improvement claimed is achieved.
The proposed trick adopts Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks with an intuitive motivation. It is not sufficiently novel and the empirical results do not prove sufficient effectiveness of this incremental approach.
- "assume that the squared parameter-wise distance between .. surrogate to the paths length". Can you elaborate more on this? Why should this be the case? 
- Why do you substitute mean and variance with initialization mean variance in derivation in Eq 15 and 16?
-  Regarding "A comparison of the Total Squared Distance to Identityâ€¦": where is the comparison?
- Why there is no Highway Neural Networks result in Table 5? 
- In Table 5, why does  He et al. (2015b)  give 6.61 which does not match with 6.43 in that paper? 
- Regarding "Our results don't surpass the state-of-the-art, which was expected considering the hardware limitations. However, taking into account the improvement observed when augmenting a smaller Wide ResNet, we believe that the technique proposed can be used to surpass the state-of-the-art", you may use that result for sanity check during the empirical work but how can you claim that you will get any improvement over baselines in final comparison? 
- Baselines have Imagenet results. In order to obtain satisfactory comparison, you would need that too. Are there any results on Imagenet comparison?
