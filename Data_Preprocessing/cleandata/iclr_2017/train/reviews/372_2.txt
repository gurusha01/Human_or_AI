A new memory module based on k-NN is presented.
The paper is very well written and the results are convincing. 
Omniglot is a good sanity test and the performance is surprisingly good.
The artificial task shows us that the authors claims hold and highlight the need for better benchmarks in this domain.
And the translation task eventually makes a very strong point on practical usefulness of the proposed model.
I am not a specialist in memory networks so I trust the authors to double-check if all relevant references have been included (another reviewer mentioned associative LSTM). But besides that I think this is a very nice and useful paper. I hope the authors will publish their code.
