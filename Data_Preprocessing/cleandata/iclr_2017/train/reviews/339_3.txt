This paper not only shows that a cache model on top of a pre-trained RNN can improve language modeling, but also illustrates a shortcoming of standard RNN models in that they are unable to capture this information themselves. Regardless of whether this is due to the small BPTT window (35 is standard) or an issue with the capability of the RNN itself, this is a useful insight. This technique is an interesting variation of memory augmented neural networks with a number of advantages to many of the standard memory augmented architectures.
They illustrate the neural cache model on not just the Penn Treebank but also WikiText-2 and WikiText-103, two datasets specifically tailored to illustrating long term dependencies with a more realistic vocabulary size. I have not seen the ability to refer up to 2000 words back previously.
I recommend this paper be accepted. There is additionally extensive analysis of the hyperparameters on these datasets, providing further insight.
I recommend this interesting and well analyzed paper be accepted.
