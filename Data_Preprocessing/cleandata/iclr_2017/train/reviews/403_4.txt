Paper Summary 
This paper formalizes the properties required for addressing (indexing) memory augmented neural networks as well as how to pair the addressing with read/write operation. It then proposes a framework in which any Lie group as the addressing space. Experiments on algorithmic tasks are reported.
 Review Summary 
This paper brings unity and formalism in the requirement for memory addressing while maintaining differentiable memories. Its proposal provide a generic scheme to build addressing mechanisms. When comparing the proposed approach with key-value networks, the unbounded number of memory cells and the lack of incentive to reuse indexes might reveal impractical. 
 Detailed Review 
The paper reads well, has appropriate relevance to related work. The unified presentation of memory augmented networks is clear and brings unity to the field. The proposed approach is introduced clearly, is powerful and gives a tool that can be reused after reading the article. I do not appreciate that the growing memory is not mentioned as a drawback. It should be stressed and a discussion on the impact it has on efficiency/scalability is needed.
