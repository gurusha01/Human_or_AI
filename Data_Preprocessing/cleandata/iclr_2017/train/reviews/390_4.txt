Thank you for an interesting read on an approach to choose computational models based on kind of examples given.
Pros
- As an idea, using a meta controller to decide the computational model and the number of steps to reach the conclusion is keeping in line with solving an important practical issue of increased computational times of a simple example. 
- The approach seems similar to an ensemble learning construct. But instead of random experts and a fixed computational complexity during testing time the architecture is designed to estimate hyper-parameters like number of ponder steps which gives this approach a distinct advantage.
Cons
- Even though the metacontroller is designed to choose the best amongst the given experts, its complete capability has not been explored yet. It would be interesting to see the architecture handle more than 2 experts.
