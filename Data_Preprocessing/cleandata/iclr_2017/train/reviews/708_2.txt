The paper presents a method for generating adversarial input images for a convolutional neural network given only black box access (ability to obtain outputs for chosen inputs, but no access to the network parameters).  However, the notion of adversarial example is somewhat weakened in this setting: it is k-misclassification (ensuring the true label is not a top-k output), instead of misclassification to any desired target label.
A similar black-box setting is examined in Papernot et al. (2016c).  There, black-box access is used to train a substitute for the network, which is then attacked.  Here, black-box access in instead exploited via local search.  The input is perturbed, the resulting change in output scores is examined, and perturbations that push the scores towards k-misclassification are kept.
A major concern with regard to novelty is that this greedy local search procedure is analogous to gradient descent; a numeric approximation (observe change in output for corresponding change in input) is used instead of backpropagation, since one does not have access to the network parameters.  As such, the greedy local search algorithm itself, to which the paper devotes a large amount of discussion, is not surprising and the paper is fairly incremental in terms of technical novelty.
