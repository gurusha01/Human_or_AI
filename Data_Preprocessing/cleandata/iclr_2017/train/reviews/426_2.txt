The paper focuses on bilingual word representation learning with the following setting:
1. Bilingual representation is learnt in an offline manner i.e., we already have monolingual representations for the source and target language and we are learning a common mapping for these two representations.
2. There is no direct word to word alignments available between the source and target language.
This is a practically useful setting to consider and authors have done a good job of unifying the existing solutions for this problem by providing theoretical justifications. Even though the authors do not propose a new method for offline bilingual representation learning, the paper is significant for the following contributions:
1. Theory for offline bilingual representation learning.
2. Inverted softmax.
3. Using cognate words for languages that share similar scripts.
4. Showing that this method also works at sentence level (to some extent).
Authors have addressed all my pre-review questions and I am ok with their response. I have few more comments:
1. Header for table 3 which says "word frequency" is misleading. "word frequency" could mean that rare words occur in row-1 while I guess authors meant to say that rare words occur in row-5.
2. I see that authors have removed precision @5 and @10 from table-6. Is it because of the space constraints or the results have different trend? I would like to see these results in the appendix.
3. In table-6 what is the difference between row-3 and row-4? Is the only difference NN vs. inverted softmax? Or there are other differences? Please elaborate.
4. Another suggestion is to try running an additional experiment where one can use both expert dictionary and cognate dictionary. Comparing all 3 methods in this setting should give more valuable insights about the usefulness of cognate dictionary.
