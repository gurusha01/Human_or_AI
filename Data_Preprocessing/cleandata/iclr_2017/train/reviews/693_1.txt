This paper presents a meta-learning algorithm which learns to learn generative models from a small set of examples. It's similar in structure to the matching networks of Vinyals et al. (2016), and is trained in a meta-learning framework where the inputs correspond to datasets. Results are shown on Omniglot in terms of log-likelihoods and in terms of generated samples. 
The proposed idea seems reasonable, but I'm struggling to understand various aspects of the paper. The exposition is hard to follow, partly because existing methods are described using terminology fairly different from that of the original authors. Most importantly, I can't tell which aspects are meant to be novel, since there are only a few sentences devoted to matching networks, even though this work builds closely upon them. (I brought this up in my Reviewer Question, and the paper has not been revised to make this clearer.)
I'm also confused about the meta-learning setup. One natural formulation for meta-learning of generative models would be that the inputs consist of small datasets X, and the task is to predict the distribution from which X was sampled. But this would imply a uniform weighting of data points, which is different from the proposed method. Based on 3.1, it seems like one additionally has some sort of query q, but it's not clear what this represents. 
In terms of experimental validation, there aren't any comparisons against prior work. This seems necessary, since several other methods have already been proposed which are similar in spirit.
