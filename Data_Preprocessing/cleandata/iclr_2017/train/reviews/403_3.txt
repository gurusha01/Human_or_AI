The paper proposes a new memory access scheme based on Lie group actions for NTMs.
Pros:
* Well written
* Novel addressing scheme as an extension to NTM.
* Seems to work slightly better than normal NTMs.
* Some interesting theory about the novel addressing scheme based on Lie groups.
Cons:
* In the results, the LANTM only seems to be slightly better than the normal NTM.
* The result tables are a bit confusing.
* No source code available.
* The difference to the properties of normal NTM doesn't become too clear. Esp it is said that LANTM are better than NTM because they are differentiable end-to-end and provide a robust relative indexing scheme but NTM are also differentiable end-to-end and also provide a robust indexing scheme.
* It is said that the head is discrete in NTM but actually it is in space R^n, i.e. it is already continuous. It doesn't become clear what is meant here.
* No tests on real-world tasks, only some toy tasks.
* No comparisons to some of the other NTM extensions such as D-NTM or Sparse Access Memory (SAM) (
