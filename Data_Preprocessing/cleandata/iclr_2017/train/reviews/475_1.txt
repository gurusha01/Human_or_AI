Paper proposes a novel Variational Encoder architecture that contains discrete variables. Model contains an undirected discrete component that captures distribution over disconnected manifolds and a directed hierarchical continuous component that models the actual manifolds (induced by the discrete variables). In essence the model clusters the data and at the same time learns a continuous manifold representation for the clusters. The training procedure for such models is also presented and is quite involved. Experiments illustrate state-of-the-art performance on public datasets (including MNIST, Omniglot, Caltech-101). 
Overall the model is interesting and could be useful in a variety of applications and domains. The approach is complex and somewhat mathematically involved. It's not exactly clear how the model compares or relates to other RBM formulations, particularly those that contain discrete latent variables and continuous outputs. As a prime example:

Discussion of this should certainly be added.
