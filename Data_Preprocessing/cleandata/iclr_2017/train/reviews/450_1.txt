I would like first to apologize for the delay.
Summary: A framework for two-samples statistical test using binary
classification is proposed. It allows multi-dimensional sample testing and
an interpretability that other tests lack. A theoritical analysis is
provided and various empirical tests reported.
A very interesting approach. I have however two main concerns.
The clarity of the presentation is obscured by too much content. It would
be more interesting if the presentation could be somewhat
self-contained. You could consider making 2 papers out of this paper.
Seriously, you cram a lot of experiments in this paper. But the setting
of the experiments is not really explained. We are supposed to have read
Jitkrittum et al., 2016, Radford et al., 2016, Yu et al., 2015, etc. All 
this is okay but reduces your public to a very few.
For example, if I am not mistaken, you never explained what SCF is, despite
the fact that its performances are reported. 
As a second point, given also that the number of submissions to this conference are exploding,
I would like to challenge you with the following question:
Why is this work significant to the representation learning community?
