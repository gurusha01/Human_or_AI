I agree with the other reviewer that the application areas are limited in the paper. I agree with the overall sentiment of the paper to evaluate effectiveness of some of the more recent techniques in this area, in conjunction with the recurrent networks. 
The paper advertises itself as a method (or a list of methods) of improving the recurrent baselines when performing experiments, however fails (or not shown) to generalize to other tasks. Effectiveness of these methods need to be shown across a wide variety of tasks if we intend to replace traditional baselines in general, rather than a specific subset of applications.
I like the desire to evaluate many of the recent techniques and having many replications of experiments towards this end (which is a strong point of the paper). However, whether there are synergies of some of the enhancements with sentiment analysis or not, we cannot see from these results. It would be interesting to see whether some of these results generalize across a wide variety of tasks.
