This work proposes a joint classification of images and audio captions for the task of word like discovery of acoustic units that correlate to semantically visual objects. The general this is a very interesting direction of research as it allows for a richer representation of data: regularizing visual signal with audio and visa versa. This allows for training of visual models from video, etc. 
A major concern is the amount of novelty between this work and the author's previous publication at NIPs 2016. The authors claim a more sophisticated architecture and indeed show an improvement in recall. However, the improvements are marginal, and the added complexity to the architecture is a bit ad hoc. Clustering and grouping in section 4, is hacky. Instead of gridding the image, the authors could actually use an object detector (SSD, Yolo, FasterRCNN, etc.) to estimate accurate object proposals; rather than using k-means, a spectral clustering approach would alleviate the gaussian assumption of the distributions. In assigning visual hypotheses with acoustic segments, some form of bi-partite matching should be used.
Overall, I really like this direction of research, and encourage the authors to continue developing algorithms that can train from such multimodal datasets. However, the work isn't quite novel enough from NIPs 2016.
