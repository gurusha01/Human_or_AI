strengths:
A method is proposed in this paper to initialize the encoder and decoder of the seq2seq model using the trained weights of language models with no parallel data. After such pretraining, all weights are jointly fine-tuned with parallel labeled data with an additional language modeling loss.
It is shown that pretraining accelerates training and improves generalization of seq2seq models.
The main value of the proposed method is to leverage separate source and target corpora, contrasting the common methods of using large amounts of parallel training corpora.
weaknesses:
The objective function shown in the middle of pg 3 is highly empirical, not directly linked to how non-parallel data helps to improve the final prediction results. The paper should compare with and discuss the objective function based on expectation of cross entropy which is directly linked to improving prediction results as proposed in arXiv:1606.04646, Chen et al.:  Unsupervised Learning of Predictors from Unpaired Input-Output Samples, 2016.
The pre-training procedure proposed in this paper is also closely connected with the DNN pretraining method presented in Dahl et al. 2011, 2012. Comparisons should be made in the paper, highlighting why the proposed one is conceptually superior if the authors believe so.
