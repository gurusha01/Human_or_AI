This paper proposes an improved version of matching networks, with better scalability properties with respect to the support set of a few-shot classifier. Instead of considering each support point individually, they learn an embedding function that aggregates over items of each class within the support set (eq. 1). This is combined with episodic few-shot training with randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes, so that the training and testing scenarios match closely.
Although the idea is quite straightforward, and there are a great many prior works on zero-shot and few-shot learning, the proposed technique is novel to my knowledge, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several  benchmark datasets. One addition that I think would improve the paper is a clearer description of the training algorithm (perhaps pseudocode). In its current form the paper a bit vague about this.
