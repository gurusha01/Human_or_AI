This paper can be seen as instantiating a famous paper by the founder of AI John McCarthy on learning to take advice (which was studied in depth by other later researchers, such as Jack Mostow in the card game Hearts). The idea is that the agent is given high level instructions on how to solve a problem, and must distill from it a low level policy. This is quite related to how humans learn complex tasks in many domains (e.g., driving, where a driving instructor may provide advice such as "keep a certain distance from the car in front"). 
A fairly complex neural deep learning controller architecture is used, although the details of this system are somewhat confusing in terms of many details that are presented. A simpler approach might have been easier to follow, at least initially. The experiments unfortunately are on a rather simplistic 2D maze, and it would have been worthwhile to see how the approach scaled to more complex tasks of the sort usually seen in deep RL papers these days (e.g, Atari, physics simulators etc.). 
Nice overall idea, somewhat confusing description of the solution, and an inadequate set of experiments on a less than satisfactory domain of 2D grid worlds.
