While the idea of moving the processing for machine learning into silicon contained within the (SSD) data storage devices is intriguing and offers the potential for low-power efficient computation, it is a rather specialized topic, so I don't feel it will be of especially wide interest to the ICLR audience. The paper describes simulation results, rather than actual hardware implementation, and describes implementations of existing algorithms. 
The comparisons of algorithms' train/test performance does not seem relevant (since there is no novelty in the algorithms) and the use of a single layer perceptron on MNIST calls into question the practicality of the system, since this is a tiny neural network by today's standards. I did not understand from the paper how it was thought that this could scale to contemporary scaled networks, in terms of numbers of parameters for both storage and bandwidth. 
I am not an expert in this area, so have not evaluated in depth.
