I like the idea the paper is exploring. Nevertheless I see some issues with the analysis:
- To get a better understanding of the quality of the results, I think at least some state-of-the-art comparisons should be included (e.g. by setting d times d pixel patches too their average and applying a denoising autoencoder). If they perform significantly better, then this indicates that the presented model is not yet taking all the information from the input image that could be used.
- SCT-R and FOV-R are supposed to test how much information can be restored from the Fovea alone as opposed to the Fovea together with low resolution periphery. However, there is an additional difference between the two conditions: According to the paper, in SCT-R, part of the image was set to zero, while in FOV-R it was removed alltogether. With only one or two hidden layers, I could easily imagine this making a difference.
- On page 4, you compare the performance of FOV-R (1% error) with that of DS-D (1.5%) and attribute this to information about the periphery that the autoencoder extracts from the fovea. While this might be the case, at least part of the reduced error will be due to the fact that the fovea is (hopefully) perfectly reconstructed. To answer the actual question "how much additional information about the periphery can be extracted from the fovea", you should consider calculating the error only in the periphery, i.e. the part of the image where DS-D and FOV-R got exactly the same input for. Then any decreased error is only due to the additional fovea information.
Other issues:
- The images in Figure 2 (a) and (b) in the rows "factor 2", "factor 4", "factor 8" look very blurry. There seems some interpolation to be going on (although slighly different than the bilinear interpolation). This makes it hard to asses how much information is in these images. I think it would be much more insightfull to print them with "nearest" interpolation.
- Figure 3 caption too vague. Maybe add something like footnote 2?
- Often figures appear too early in paper which leads to lots of distance between text and figures.
