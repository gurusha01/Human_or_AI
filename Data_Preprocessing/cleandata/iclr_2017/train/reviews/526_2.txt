This paper adopts Taylor approximations of neural nets for separating convex and non-convex components of the optimization. This enables them to bound the training error by the Taylor optimum and regret (theorem 2). This is a nice theoretical result applicable to popular deep nets. The empirical studies back up the theoretical claim.
