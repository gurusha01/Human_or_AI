Pros: 
- Introduction of a nice filter banks and its implementation
- Good numerical results
- Refinement of the representation via back propagation, and a demonstration that it speeds up learning
Cons:
- The algorithms (section 3.1) are not necessary, and they even affect the presentation of the paper. However, a source code would be great!
- The link with a scattering transform is not clear
- Sometimes (as mentionned in some of my comments), the writing could be improved.
From a personal point of view, I also believe the negative points I mention can be easily removed.
