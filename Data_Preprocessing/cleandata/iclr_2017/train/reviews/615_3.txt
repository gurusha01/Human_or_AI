It is an interesting idea to go after saddle points in the optimization with an SR1 update and a good start in experiments, but missing important comparisons to recent 2nd order optimizations such as Adam, other Hessian free methods (Martens 2012), Pearlmutter fast exact multiplication by the Hessian. From the mnist/cifar curves it is not really showing an advantage to AdaDelta/Nag (although this is stated), and much more experimentation is needed to make a claim about mini-batch insensitivity to performance, can you show error rates on a larger scale task?
