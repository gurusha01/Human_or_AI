On one hand this paper is fairly standard in that it uses deep metric learning with a Siamese architecture. On the other, the connections to human perception involving persistence is quite interesting. I'm not an expert in human vision, but the comparison in general and the induced hierarchical groupings in particular seem like something that should interest people in this community. The experimental suite is ok but I was disappointed that it is 100% synthetic. The authors could have used a minimally viable real dataset such as ALOI
