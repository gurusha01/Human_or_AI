This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work on segment to segment neural transduction (SSNT) model. For the noisy channel model, the key difference from sequence-to-sequence is that the complete sequence y is not observed beforehand. SSNT handles this problem elegantly by performing incremental alignment and prediction. However, this paper does not present anything that is particular novel on top of the SSNT. The SSNT model is still applicable by reverting the input and output sequences. The authors said that an unidirectional LSTM has to be used as an encoder instead of the bidirectional LSTM, but I think the difference is minor. The decoding algorithm presented in the appendix is relatively new. 
The experimental study is very comprehensive and strong, however, there is one important baseline number that is missing for all the experiments. Can you give the number that uses direct + LM + bias, and if you can give direct + bias number would be even better. Although using a LM for the direct model does not make a lot of sense mathematically, however, it works pretty well in practice, and the LM can rescore and smooth your predictions, see

from Baidu for example. I think the LM may be also the key to explain why noisy channel is much better than direct model in Table 3. A couple minor questions are
1. it is not very clear to me is your direct model in the experiments SSNT or sequence-to-sequence model?
2. O(|x|^2*|y|) training complexity is OK, but it would be great to further cut down the computational cost, as it is still very expensive for long input sequences, for example, for paragraph or document level modeling, or speech sequences. 
The paper is well written, and overall, it is still an interesting paper, as the channel model is always of great interest to the general public.
