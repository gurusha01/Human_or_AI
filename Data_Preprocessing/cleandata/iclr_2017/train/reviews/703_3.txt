This seems like a reasonable study, though it's not my area of expertise. I found no fault with the work or presentation, but did not follow the details or know the comparable literature. 
There seem to be real gains to be had through this technique, though they are only in terms of efficiency in hardware, not changing accuracy on a task. The tasks chosen (Alexnet / VGG) seem reasonable. The results are in simulation rather than in actual hardware.
The topic seems a little specialized for ICLR, since it does not describe any new advances in learning or representations, albeit that the CFP includes "hardware".  I think the appeal among attendees will be rather limited.
