The research direction taken by this paper is of great interest. 
However, the empirical results are not great enough to pay for the weaknesses of the proposed approach (see Section 6). 
"Throughout this paper the selection of hyper-parameters was kept rather simple." but the momentum term of CPN is set to 0.95 
and not 0.9 as in all/most optimizers CPN is compared to. I suppose that the positive effect of CPN (if any) is mostly due to its momentum term.
