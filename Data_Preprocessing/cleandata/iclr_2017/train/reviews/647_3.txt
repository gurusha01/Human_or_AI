This paper presents a method to learn both a model and inference procedure at the same time with recurrent neural networks in the context of inverse problems.
The proposed method is interesting and results are quite good. The paper is also nicely presented. 
I would be happy to see some discussion about what the network learns in practice about natural images in the case of denoising. What are the filters like? Is it particularly sensitive to different structures in images? edges? Also, what is the state in the recurrent unit used for? when are the gates open etc.
Nevertheless, I think this is nice work which should be accepted.
