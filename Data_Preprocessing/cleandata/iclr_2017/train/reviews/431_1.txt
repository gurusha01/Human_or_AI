This paper introduces an analytical performance model to estimate the training and evaluation time of a given network for different software, hardware and communication strategies. 
The paper is very clear.  The authors included many freedoms in the variables while calculating the run-time of a network such as the number of workers, bandwidth, platform, and parallelization strategy. Their results are consistent with the reported results from literature.
Furthermore, their code is open-source and the live demo is looking good. 
The authors mentioned in their comment that they will allow users to upload customized networks and model splits in the coming releases of the interface, then the tool can become very useful.
It would be interesting to see some newer network architectures with skip connections such as ResNet, and DenseNet.
