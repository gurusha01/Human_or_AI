Review
This paper proposes five modifications to improve PixelCNN, a generative model with tractable likelihood. The authors empirically showed the impact of each of their proposed modifications using a series of ablation experiments. They also reported a new state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10.
Improving generative models, especially for images, is an active research area and this paper definitely contributes to it.
Pros
The authors motivate each modification well they proposed. They also used ablation experiments to show each of them is important.
The authors use a discretized mixture of logistic distributions to model the conditional distribution of a sub-pixel instead of a 256-way softmax. This allows to have a lower output dimension and to be better suited at learning ordinal relationships between sub-pixel values. The authors also mentioned it speeded up training time (less computation) as well as the convergence during the optimization of the model (as shown in Fig.6).
The authors make an interesting remark about how the dependencies between the color channels of a pixel are likely to be relatively simple and do not require a deep network to model. This allows them to have a simplified architecture where you don't have to separate out all feature maps in 3 groups depending on whether or not they can see the R/G/B sub-pixel of the current location.
Cons
It is not clear to me what the predictive distribution for the green channel (and the blue) looks like. More precisely, how are the means of the mixture components linearly depending on the value of the red sub-pixel? I would have liked to see the equations for them.
Minor Comments
In Fig.2 it is written "Sequence of 6 layers" but in the text (Section 2.4) it says 6 blocks of 5 ResNet layers. What is the remaining layer?
In Fig.2 what does the first "green square -> blue square" which isn't in the white rectangle represents?
Is there any reason why the mixture indicator is shared across all three channels?
