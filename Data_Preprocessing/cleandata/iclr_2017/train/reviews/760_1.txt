The paper discusses a method to learn interpretable hierarchical template representations from given data. The authors illustrate their approach on binary images.
The paper presents a novel technique for extracting interpretable hierarchical template representations based on a small set of standard operations. It is then shown how a combination of those standard operations translates into a task equivalent to a boolean matrix factorization. This insight is then used to formulate a message passing technique which was shown to produce accurate results for these types of problems.
Summary:
———
The paper presents an novel formulation for extracting hierarchical template representations that has not been discussed in that form. Unfortunately the experimental results are on smaller scale data and extension of the proposed algorithm to more natural images seems non-trivial to me.
Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition.
Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.
Originality: The suggested idea is reasonable but limited to binary data at this point in time.
Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge.

1. My main concern is related to the experimental evaluation. While the discussed approach is valuable, its application seems limited to binary images at this point in time. Can the authors comment?
2. There are existing techniques to extract representations of images which the authors may want to mention, e.g., work based on grammars.
