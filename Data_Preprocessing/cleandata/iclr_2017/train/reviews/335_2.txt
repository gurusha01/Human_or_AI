This paper proposes a hierarchical infomax method. My comments are as follows: 
(1) First of all, this paper is 21 pages without appendix, and too long as a conference proceeding. Therefore, it is not easy for readers to follow the paper. The authors should make this paper as compact as possible while maintaining the important message. 
(2) One of the main contribution in this paper is to find a good initialization point by maximizing I(X;R). However, it is unclear why maximizing I(X;\breve{Y}) is good for maximizing I(X;R) because Proposition 2.1 shows that I(X;\breve{Y}) is an "upper" bound of I(X;R) (When it is difficult to directly maximize a function, people often maximize some tractable "lower" bound of it).
Minor comments:
(1) If (2.11) is approximation of (2.8), "\approx" should be used. 
(2) Why K_1 instead of N in Eq.(2.11)?
(3) In Eq.(2.12), H(X) should disappear?
(4) Can you divide Section 3 into subsections?
