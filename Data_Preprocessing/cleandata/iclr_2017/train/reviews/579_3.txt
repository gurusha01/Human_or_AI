This paper presents a hybrid architecture for time series prediction, focusing on the slope and duration of linear trends. The architecture consists of combining a 1D convnet for local time series and an LSTM for time series of trend descriptors. The convnet and LSTM features are combined into an MLP for predicting either the slope or the duration of the next trend in a 1D time series. The method is evaluated on 3 small datasets.
Summary:
This paper, while relative well written and presenting an interesting approach, has several methodology flaws, that should be handled by new experiments.
Pros:
The idea of extracting upward or downward trends from time series - although these should, ideally be learned, not rely on an ad-hoc technique, given that this is a submission for ICLR.
Methodology:
* In section 3, what do you mean by predicting "either [the duration] $\hat lt$ or [slope] $\hat st$" of the trend? Predictions are valid only if those two predictions are done jointly. The two losses should be combined during training.
* In the entire paper, the trend slope and duration need to be predicted jointly. Predicting a time series without specifying the horizon of the prediction is meaningless. If the duration of the trends is short, the time series could go up or down alternatively; if the duration of the trend is long, the slope might be close to zero. Predictions at specific horizons are needed.
* In general, time series prediction for such applications as trading and load forecasting is pointless if no decision is made. A trading strategy would be radically different for short-term and noisy oscillations or from long-term, stable upward or downward trend. An actual evaluation in terms of trading profit/loss should be added for each of the baselines, including the naïve baselines.
* As mentioned earlier in the pre-review questions, an important baseline is missing: feeding the local time series to the convnet and connecting the convnet directly to the LSTM, without ad-hoc trend extraction.
* The convnet -> LSTM architecture would need an analysis of the convnet filters and trend prediction representation.
* Trend prediction/segmentation by the convnet could be an extra supervised loss.
* The detailed analysis of the trend extraction technique is missing.
* In section 5, the SVM baselines have local trend and local time series vectors concatenated. Why isn't the same approach used for LSTM baselines (as a multivariate input) and why the convnet operates only on local 
* An important, "naïve" baseline is missing: next local trend slope and duration = previous local trend slope and duration.

The organization of the paper needs improvement:
* Section 3 does not explain the selection of the maximal tolerable variance in each trend segment. The appendix should be moved to the core part of the paper.
* Section 4 is unnecessarily long and gives well known details and equations about convnets and LSTMs. The only variation from standard algorithm descriptions is that $lk$ $sk$ are concatenated. The feature fusion layer can be expressed by a simple MLP on the concatenation of R(T(l)) and C(L(t)). Details could be moved to the appendix.
Additional questions:
*In section 5, how many datapoints are there in each dataset? Listing only the number of local trends is uninformative.
Typos:
* p. 5, top "duration and slop"
