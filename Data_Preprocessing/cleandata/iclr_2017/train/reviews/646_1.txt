1. the QA model is not novel, very similar to the existing model.
2. The IQA model is very confusing. If it needs human interactive in the training process, how could it be practical to ask human to join the training in each iteration? It sounds impractical. If the human interactive questions are predefined, then it is not interactive at all, since it is not based on the current state of model output.
