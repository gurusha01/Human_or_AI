This nicely written paper presents an end-to-end learning method for image compression. By optimizing for rate-distortion performance and a clever relaxation the method is able to learn an efficient image compression method by optimizing over a database of natural images.
As the method is interesting, results are interesting and analysis is quite thorough it's easy for me to recommend acceptance.
