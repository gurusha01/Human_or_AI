The authors introduce a new memory model which allows memory access in O(log n) time.
Pros:
* The paper is well written and everything is clear.
* It's a new model and I'm not aware of a similar model.
* It's clear that memory access time is an issue for longer sequences and it is clear how this model solves this problem.
Cons:
* The motivation for O(log n) access time is to be able to use the model on very long sequences. While it is clear from the definition that the computation time is low because of its design, it is not clear that the model will really generalize well to very long sequences.
* The model was also not tested on any real-world task.
I think such experiments should be added to show whether the model really works on long sequences and real-world tasks, otherwise it is not clear if this is a useful model.
