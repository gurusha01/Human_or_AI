Paper addresses systematic discrepancies between simulated and real-world policy control domains. Proposed method contains two ideas: 1) training on an ensemble of models in an adversarial fashion to learn policies that are robust to errors and 2) adaptation of the source domain ensemble using data from a (real-world) target domain. 
> Significance
Paper addresses and important and significant problem. The approach taken in addressing it is also interesting 
> Clarity
Paper is well written, but does require domain knowledge to understand. 
My main concerns were well addressed by the rebuttal and corresponding revisions to the paper.
