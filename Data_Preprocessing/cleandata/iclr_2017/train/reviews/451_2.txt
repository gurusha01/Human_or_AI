This paper studies the energy landscape of the loss function in neural networks.  It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level sets of the loss becomes connected as the network is increasingly overparameterized.  It also quantifies, in a way, the degree of disconnectedness possible in terms of the increase in loss that one must allow to find a connected path.  It would seem that this might have some implications for the likelihood of escaping local minima with stochastic gradient descent.  The paper also presents a simple algorithm for finding geodesic paths between two networks such that the loss is decreasing along the path.  Using this they show that the loss seems to become more nonconvex when the loss is smaller.  This is also quite interesting.
The work does have some significant limitations, which is not surprising given the difficulty of fully analyzing the network loss function.  However, the authors are quite clear about these limitations, which especially include not yet analyzing deep networks and analyzing only the oracle loss, and not the empirical loss.  I would have also appreciated a little more practical discussion of the bound in Theorem 2.4.  It is hard to tell whether this bound is tight enough to be practically relevant.
