This paper presents a novel model for unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data.  A recurrent hidden semi-markov model is proposed.  This extends regular hidden semi-markov models to include a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observations.  Each latent class has its own RNN for modeling observations for that category.  Further, an efficient training procedure based on a variational approximation.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for modeling synthetic and real time series data.
This is an interesting and novel paper.  The proposed method is a well-motivated combination of duration modeling HMMs with state of the art observation models based on RNNs.  The combination alleviates shortcomings of standard HSMM variants in terms of the simplicity of the emission probability.  The method is technically sound and demonstrated to be effective.
It would be interesting to see how this method compares quantitatively against CRF-based methods (e.g. Ammar, Dyer, and Smith NIPS 2014).  CRFs can model more complex data likelihoods, though as noted in the response phase there are still limitations.  Regardless, I think the merits of using RNNs for the class-specific generative models are clear.
