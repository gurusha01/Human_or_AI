The current version of the paper is improved w.r.t. the original arXiv version from June. While the results are exactly the same, the text does not oversell them as much as before. You may also consider to avoid words like "mantra", etc. 
I believe that my criticism given in my comment from 3 Dec 2016 about "randomly generated task" is valid and you answer is not.
