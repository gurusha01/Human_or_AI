The author proposed a simple but yet effective technique in order to regularized neural networks. The results obtained are quite good and the technique shows to be effective when it it applied even on state of the art topologies, that is welcome because some regularization techniques used to be applied in easy task or on a initial configuration which results are still far from the best known results. 
This is a good paper with the appropriate experimentation. Regularization must be tested on deep and complex topologies, near to state of the art. Other papers test reg. with simple models where regularization helps but are not in the edge...
