Summary: The paper presents a smaller CNN architecture called SqueezeNet for embedded deployment. The paper explores CNN macroarchitecture and microarchitecture to develop SqueezeNet, which is composed of fire modules.
Pros: 
Achieves x50 less memory usage than AlexNet while keeping similar accuracy.
Cons & Questions:
Complex by-pass has less accuracy than simple by-pass. And simple by-pass is like ResNet bottlenecks and complex by-pass is like inception modules in GoogLeNet. Can we say that these two valiants of SqueezeNet are adaptation of concepts seen in GoogLeNet and ResNet? If so, then shouldn't be there a SqueezeNet like model that achieves similar accuracy compared with GoogLeNet and ResNet?
