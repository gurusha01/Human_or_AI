The paper proposes an approach to the task of multimodal machine translation, namely to the case when an image is available that corresponds to both source and target sentences. 
The idea seems to be to use a latent variable model and condition it on the image. In practice from Equation 3 and Figure 3 one can see that the image is only used during training to do inference. That said, the approach appears flawed, because the image is not really used for translation.
Experimental results are weak. If the model selection was done properly, that is using the validation set, the considered model would only bring 0.6 METEOR and 0.2 BLEU advantage over the baseline. In the view of the overall variance of the results, these improvements can not be considered significant. 
The qualitative analysis in Subsection 4.4 appears inconclusive and unconvincing.
Overall, there are major issues with both the approach and the execution of the paper.
