The paper considers the problem of reinforcement learning where the number of policy updates is required to be low. The problem is well motivated and the author provides an interesting modification to the PoWER algorithm, along with variational bounds on the value function (lemmas 3,4) which are interesting in themselves. They also provide numerical results on the cartpole problem and a problem in online advertising with real data. Overall this is a strong, well-written paper. My main reservation is whether it is completely appropriate for ICLR, since the log-concavity assumption the model relies on appear to restrict to simpler models where representations will be not in fact be learned.
Other comments:
- There is a general lack of baselines in the numerical experiment section. I acknowledge this is somewhat of an unusual setting, but even a simple, well-justified baseline would have been welcome. Since cartpole is a relatively simple problem and the advertising dataset is presumably private, perhaps a way to generate a synthetic advertising dataset would have been interesting.
- I was confused by the control variates as constant scalars - are they meant to be constant baselines? And if so, they appear to be treated as hyperparameters -  why are they not learned or estimated?
- There is an interesting section on constrained optimization, but as it is, feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the paper. It appears applicable to the problem of online advertising, but is not mentioned in the corresponding experimental section. Also might be worth adding a citation to the literature of constrained MDPs which develops similar lagrangian ideas.
