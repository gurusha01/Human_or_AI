Pros : 
- New and clear formalism for invariance on signals with known structure
- Good numerical results
Cons :
- The structure must be specified.
- The set structure dataset is too simple
- There is a gap between the large (and sometimes complex) theory introduced and the numerical experiments ; consequently a new reader could be lost since examples might be missing
Besides, from a personal point of view, I think the topic of the paper and its content could be suitable for a big conference as the author improves its content.  Thus, if rejected, I think you should not consider the workshop option for your paper if you wish to publish it later in a conference, because big conferences might consider the workshop papers of ICLR as publications. (that's an issue I had to deal with at some points)
