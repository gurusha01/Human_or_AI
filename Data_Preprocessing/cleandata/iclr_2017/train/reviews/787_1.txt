The paper proposes a semantic embedding based approach to multilabel classification. 
Conversely to previous proposals, SEM considers the underlying parameters determining the
observed labels are low-rank rather than that the observed label matrix is itself low-rank. 
However, It is not clear to what extent the difference between the two assumptions is significant
SEM models the labels for an instance as draws from a multinomial distribution
parametrized by nonlinear functions of the instance features. As such, it is a neural network.
The proposed training algorithm is slightly more complicated than vanilla backprop.  The significance of the results compared to NNML (in particular on large datasets Delicious and EUrlex) is not very clear. 
The paper is well written and the main idea is clearly presented. However, the experimental results are not significant enough to compensate the lack of conceptual novelty.
