This paper makes three main methodological contributions:
 - definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron
 - ranking of neurons based on color selectivity
 - ranking of neurons based on class selectivity
The main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods.
However, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets. For example, a few are:
 - "Indexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers." As far as I know, this had not been previously reported.
 - Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5)
 - "our main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011))." Great observation!
Overall, I'd recommend the paper be accepted, because although it's difficult to predict at this time, there's a fair chance that one of the "smaller conclusions" would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence.
Other small comments:
 - The cite for "Learning to generate chairsâ€¦" is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite)
 - What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn't well defined and it wasn't previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described.
 - For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of any color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it's somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn't color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It's a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)
