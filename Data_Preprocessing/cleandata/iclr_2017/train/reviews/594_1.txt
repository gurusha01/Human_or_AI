The author proposes the use of low-rank matrix in feedfoward and RNNs. In particular, they try their approach in a GRU and a feedforward highway network.
Author also presents as a contribution the passthrough framework, which can describe feedforward and recurrent networks. However, this framework seems hardly novel, relatively to the formalism introduced by LSTM or highway networks.
An empirical evaluation is performed on different datasets (MNIST, memory/addition tasks, sequential permuted MNIST and character level penntreebank). 
However, there are few problems with the evaluation:
- In the highway network experiment, the author does not compare with a baseline.
We can not assess what it the impact of the low-rank parameterization. Also, it would be interesting to compare the result with a highway network that have this capacity bottleneck across layer  (first layer of size $n$, second layer of size $d$, third layer of size $n$) and not in the gate functions. Also, how did you select the hyperparameter values?.
- It is unfortunate that the character level penntreebank does not use the same experimental setting than previous works as it prevents from direct comparison.
Also the overall bpc perplexity seems relatively high for this dataset. It is therefore not clear how low-rank decomposition would perform on this task applied on a stronger baseline.
-Author claims state-of-art in the memory task. However, their approach uses  more parameters than the uRNN (41K against 6.5K for the memory) which makes the comparison a little bit unfair toward uRNN. It would be informative to see how low-rank RNN performs using overall 6.5K parameters. Generally, it would be good to see what is the impact of the matrix rank given a fix state size.
- It would be informative as well to have the baseline and the uRNN curve in Figure 2 for the memory/addition task.
- it is not clear when to use low-rank or low-rank + diagonal from the experiments.
Overall, the evaluation in its current form in not really convincing, except for the sequential MNIST dataset.
