The authors propose a recurrent neural network approach for constructing a
stochastic volatility model for financial time series. They introduce an
inference network based on a recurrent neural network that computes the
approximation to the posterior distribution for the latent variables given the
past data. This variational approximation is used to maximize the marginal
likelihood in order to learn the parameters of the model. The proposed method
is validated in experiments with synthetic and real-world time series, showing
to outperform parametric GARCH models and a Gaussian process volatility model.

The method proposed seems technically correct, with the exception that in
equation (19) the inference model is doing filtering and not smoothing, in the
sense that the posterior for zt' only depends on those other zt and x_t
values with t
