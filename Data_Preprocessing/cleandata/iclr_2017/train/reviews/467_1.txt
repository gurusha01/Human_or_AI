This paper provides an interesting idea, which extends GAN by taking into account bidirectional network. Totally, the paper is well-written, and easy to follow what is contribution of this paper. From the theoretical parts, the proposed method, BiGAN, inherits similar properties in GAN. The experimental results show that BiGAN is competitive with other methods. A drawback would a non-convex optimization problem in BiGAN, this paper is still suitable to be accepted in my opinion.
