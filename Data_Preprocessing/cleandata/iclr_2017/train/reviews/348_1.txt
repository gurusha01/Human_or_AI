This paper presents a theoretical treatment of transformation groups applied to convnets, and presents some empirical results showing more efficient usage of network parameters.
The basic idea of steerability makes huge sense and seems like a very important idea to develop.  It is also a very old idea in image processing and goes back to Simoncelli, Freeman, Adelson, as well as Perona/Greenspan and others in the early 1990s.  This paper approaches it through a formal treatment of group theory.  But at the end of the day the idea seems pretty simple - the feature representation of a transformed image should be equivalent to a transformed feature representation of the original image.  Given that the authors are limiting their analysis to discrete groups - for example rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 deg. - the formalities brought in from the group theoretic analysis seem a bit overkill.  I'm not sure what this buys us in the end.  it seems the real challenge lies in implementing continuous transformations, so if the theory could guide us in that direction it would be immensely helpful.
Also the description of the experiments is fairly opaque.  I would have a hard time replicating what exactly the authors did here in terms of implementing capsules or transformation groups.
