This an interesting investigation into learning rate schedules, bringing in the idea of restarts, often overlooked in deep learning. The paper does a thorough study on non-trivial datasets, and while the outcomes are not fully conclusive, the results are very good and the approach is novel enough to warrant publication. 
I thank the authors for revising the paper based on my concerns.
