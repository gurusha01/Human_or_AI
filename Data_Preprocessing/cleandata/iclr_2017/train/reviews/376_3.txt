The authors investigate a variety of existing and two new RNN architectures to obtain more insight about the effectiveness at which these models can store task information in their parameters and activations.
The experimental setups look sound. To generalize comparisons between different architectures it's necessary to consider multiple tasks and control for the effect of the hyperparameters. This work uses multiple tasks of varying complexities, principled hyperparameter tuning methodology and a number of tuning iterations that can currently only be achieved by the computational resources of some of the larger industrial research groups. 
The descriptions of the models and the objective where very clear to me. The descriptions of the experiments and presentation of the results were not always clear to me at times, even with the additional details in the appendix available. Most of these issues can easily be resolved by editing the text. For example, in the memory task the scaling of the inputs (and hence also outputs) is not provided so it's hard to interpret the squared error scores in Figure 2c. It's not clear to me what the term 'unrollings' refers to in Figure 2b. Is this a time lag with additional hidden state updates between the presentation of the input sequence and the generation of the output? Since the perceptron capacity task is somewhat central to the paper, I think a slightly more precise description of how and when the predictions are computed would be helpful. Due to the large number of graphs, it can be somewhat hard to find the most relevant results. Perhaps some of the more obvious findings (like Figure 1(b-d) given Figure 1a) could move to the appendix to make space for more detailed task descriptions.
Novelty is not really the aim of this paper since it mostly investigates existing architectures. To use the mutual information to obtain bits per parameter scores in highly non-linear parameterized functions is new to me. The paper also proposed to new architectures that seem to have practical value. The paper adds to the currently still somewhat neglected research effort to employ the larger computational resources we currently have towards a better understanding of architectures which were designed when such resources were not yet available. I'd argue that the paper is original enough for that reason alone.
The paper provides some interesting new insights into the properties of RNNs. While observed before, it is interesting to see the importance of gated units for maintaining trainability of networks with many layers. It is also interesting to see a potential new use for vanilla RNNs for simpler tasks where a high capacity per parameter may be required due to hardware constraints. The proposed +RNN may turn out to have practical value as well and the hyperparameter robustness results shed some light on the popularity of certain architectures when limited time for HP tuning is available. The large body of results and hyperparameter analysis should be useful to many researchers who want to use RNNs in the future. All in all, I think this paper would make a valuable addition to the ICLR conference but would benefit from some improvements to the text.
Pros:
* Thorough analysis.
* Seemingly proper experiments.
* The way of quantifying capacity in neural networks adds to the novelty of the paper.
* The results have some practical value and suggest similar analysis of other architectures.
* The results provide useful insights into the relative merits of different RNN architectures.
Cons:
* It's hard to isolate the most important findings (some plots seem redundant).
* Some relevant experimental details are missing.
