This paper presents a JavaScript framework including WebCL components for training and deploying deep neural networks. The authors show that it is possible to reach competitive speeds with this technology, even higher speed than a compiled application with ViennaCL on AMD GPUs. While remaining a little more than factor three slower than compiled high performance software on NVIDIA GPUs, it offers compelling possibilities for easily deployable training and application settings for deep learning.
My main points of criticism are:
1. In Tab. 4 different batch sizes are used. Even if this is due to technical limits for the Javascript library, it would only be fair to use the smaller batch sizes for the other frameworks as well (on the GPUs probably in favor of the presented framework).
2. In Fig. 6, why not include more information in the graphs? Especially, as stated in the question, why not include the node.js values? While I do see the possible application with one server and many "low performance" clients, the setting of having a few dedicated high performance servers is quite likely. Even if not, these are good values to compare with. For the sake of consistency, please include in both subfigures Firefox, Chrome, node.js.
Apart from these points, well-written, understandable and conclusive.
