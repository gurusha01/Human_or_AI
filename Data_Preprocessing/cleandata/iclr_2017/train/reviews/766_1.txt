Paper summary: the authors proposed to use EdgeBoxes + Fast-RCNN with
batch normalization for pedestrian detection
Review summary: results do not cover enough datasets, the reported
results do not improve over state of the art, writing is poor, and
overall the work lacks novelty. This is a clear reject.
Pros:
* Shows that using batch normalization does improve results
Cons:
* Only results on ETH and INRIA. Should include Caltech or KITTI.
* Reported results are fair, but not improving over state of the art
* Overall idea of limited interest when considering works like S.
Zhang CVPR 2016 (Fast R-CNN for pedestrian detection) and L. Zhang
ECCV 2017 (Faster R-CNN for pedestrian detection)
* Issues with the text quality
* Limited takeaways
Quality: low
Clarity: fair, but poor English
Originality: low
Significance: low
For acceptance at future conferences, this work would need more
polish, improving over best known results on INRA, ETH, and Caltech or
KITTI. And ideally, present additional new insights.
Minor comments:
* The text lacks polish. E.g. influent -> influence, has maken ->
made, is usually very important -> is important, achieve more
excellent results -> achieve better results; etc. Please consider
asking help from a native speaker for future submissions. There are
also non-sense sentences such as "it is computational".
* Citations should be in parentheses
* Some of the citations are incorrect because the family name is in
the wrong position, e.g. Joseph Lim, Lawrence Zitnick, and Rodrigo Benenson.
