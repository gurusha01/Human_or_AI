In PALEO the authors propose a simple model of execution of deep neural networks. It turns out that even this simple model allows to quite accurately predict the computation time for image recognition networks both in single-machine and distributed settings.
The ability to predict network running time is very useful, and the paper shows that even a simple model does it reasonably, which is a strength. But the tests are only performed on a few networks of very similar type (AlexNet, Inception, NiN) and only in a few settings. Much broader experiments, including a variety of models (RNNs, fully connected, adversarial, etc.) in a variety of settings (different batch sizes, layer sizes, node placement on devices, etc.) would probably reveal weaknesses of the proposed very simplified model. This is why this reviewer considers this paper borderline -- it's a first step, but a very basic one and without sufficiently large experimental underpinning.
More experiments were added, so I'm updating my score.
