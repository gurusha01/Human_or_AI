This paper proposes an extension of PixelCNN method that can be conditioned on text and spatially-structured constraints (segmentation / keypoints). It is similar to Reed 2016a except the extension is built on top of PixelCNN instead of GAN. After reading the author's comment, I realized the argument is not that conditional PixelCNN is much better than conditional GAN. I think the authors can add more discussions about pros and cons of each model in the paper. I agree with the other reviewer that some analysis of training and generation time would be helpful. I understand it takes O(N) instead of O(1) for PixelCNN method to do sampling, but is that the main reason that the experiments can only be conducted in low resolution (32 x 32)? I also think since there are not quantitative comparisons, it makes more sense to show more visualizations than 3 examples. Overall, the generated results look reasonably good and have enough diversity. The color mistake is an issue where the author has provided some explanations in the comment. I would say the technical novelty is incremental since the extension is straightforward and similar to previous work. I lean toward accepting because it is very relevant to ICLR community and it provides a good opportunity for future investigation and comparison between different deep image synthesis methods.
