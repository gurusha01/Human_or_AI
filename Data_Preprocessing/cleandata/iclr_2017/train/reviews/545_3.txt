Thank you for an interesting read. The ideas presented have a good basis of being true, but the experiments are rather too simple. It would be interesting to see more empirical evidence.
Pros
- The approach seems to decrease the training time, which is of prime importance in deep learning. Although, that comes at a price of slightly more complex model.
- There is a grounded theory for sum-product functions which is basis for the compositional architecture described in the paper. Theoretically, any semiring and kernel could be used for the model which decreases need for handcrafting the structure of the model, which is a big problem in existing convolutional neural networks.
Cons
- The experiments are on very simple dataset NORB. Although, it is great to understand a model's dynamics on a simpler dataset, some analysis on complex datasets are important to act as empirical evidence. The compositional kernel approach is compared to convolutional neural networks, hence it is only fair to compare said results on large datasets such as Imagenet.
Minor
- Section 3.4 claims that CKMs model symmetries of objects. It felt that ample justification was not provided for this claim
