This paper presents a principled approach to finding flat minima. The motivation to seek such minima is due to their better generalization ability. The idea is to add to the original loss function a new term that exploits both width and depth of the objective function. In fact, the regularization term can be interpreted as Gaussian convolution of the exponentiated loss. Therefore, the introduced regularization term is essentially Gaussian smoothed version of the exponentiated loss. The smoothing obviously tends to suppress sharp minima.
Overall, developing such regularization term based on thermodynamics concepts is very interesting. I have a couple of concerns that the authors may want to clarify in the rebuttal.
1. When reporting the generalization performance, the experiments report the number of epochs; showing the proposed algorithm reaches better generalization in fewer epochs than plain SGD. Is this the number of epochs it takes by line 7 of your algorithm, or it is the total number of epochs (line 3 and 7 all combined)? If the former, it is not a fair comparison. If you multiply the number of epochs of SGD (line 7) by the number iterations it takes to approximate Langevin dynamics, it seems you obtain little gain against plain SGD.
2. The proposed algorithm approximates the smoothed "exponentiated" loss (by smoothing I refer to convolution with the Gaussian). I am wondering how it compares against simpler idea of smoothing the original loss (dropping exponentiation)? Is the difference only in the motivation (e.g. thermodynamics interpretation) or it is deeper, e.g. the proposed scheme lends itself to more accurate approximation and/or achieves better generalization bound (in terms of the attained smoothness)? Smoothing the cost function without exponentiation allows simpler approximation (Monte Carlo integration instead of MCMC), e.g. see section 5.3 of
