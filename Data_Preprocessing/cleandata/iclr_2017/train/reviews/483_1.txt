The authors formulate a recurrent deep neural network to predict human fixation locations in videos as a mixture of Gaussians. They train the model using maximum likelihood with actual fixation data. Apart from evaluating how good the model performs at predicting fixations, they combine the saliency predictions with the C3D features for action recognition.
quality: I am missing a more thorough evaluation of the fixation prediction performance. The center bias performance in Table 1 differs significantly from the on in Table 2. All the state-of-the-art models reported in Table 2 have a performance worse than the center bias performance reported in Table 1. Is there really no other model better than the center bias? Additionally I am missing details on how central bias and human performance are modelled. Is human performance cross-validated?
You claim that your "results are very close to human performance (the difference is only 3.2%). This difference is actually larger than the difference between Central Bias and your model reported in Table 1. Apart from this, it is dangerous to compare AUC performance differences due to e.g. saturation issues.
clarity: the explanation for Table 3 is a bit confusing, also it is not clear why the CONV5 and the FC6 models differ in how the saliency map is used. At least one should also evaluate the CONV5 model when multiplying the input with the saliency map to see how much of the difference comes from the different ways to use the saliency map and how much from the different features.
Other issues:
You cite KÃ¼mmerer et. al 2015 as a model which "learns ... indirectly rather than from explicit information of where humans look", however the their model has been trained on fixation data using maximum-likelihood.
Apart from these issues, I think the paper make a very interesting contribution to spatio-temporal fixation prediction. If the evaluation issues given above are sorted out, I will happily improve my rating.
