The paper proposes to add an additional term to the denoising-autoencoder objective. The new term is well motivated, it introduces an asymmetry between the encoder and decoder, forcing the encoder to represent a compressed, denoised version of the input. The authors propose to avoid the trivial solution introduced by the new term by using tied weights or normalized Euclidean distance error (the trivial solution occurs by scaling the magnitude of the code down in the encoder, and back up in the decoder). The proposed auto-encoder scheme is very similar to a host of other auto-encoders that have been out in the literature for some time. The authors evaluate the proposed scheme on toy-data distributions in 2D as well as MNIST. Although the work is well motivated, it certainly seems like an empirically unproven and incremental improvement to an old idea.
