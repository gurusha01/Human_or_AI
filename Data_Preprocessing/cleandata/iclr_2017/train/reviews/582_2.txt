This paper proposes combining different modalities of product content (e.g. review text, images, co-purchase info ...etc) in order to learn one unified product representation for recommender systems. While the idea of combining multiple sources of information is indeed an effective approach for handling data sparsity in recommender systems, I have some reservations on the approach proposed in this paper:
1) Some modalities are not necessarily relevant for the recommendation task or item similarity. For example, cover images of books or movies (which are product types in the experiments of this paper) do not tell us much about their content. The paper should clearly motivate and show how different modalities contribute to the final task.
2) The connection between the proposed joint product embedding and residual networks is a bit awkward. The original residual layers are composed of adding the original input vector to the output of an MLP, i.e. several affine transformations followed by non-linearities. These layers allow training very deep neural networks (up to 1000 layers) as a result of easier gradient flow. In contrast, the pairwise residual unit of this paper adds the dot product of two item vectors to the dot product of the same vectors but after applying a simple non-linearity. The motivation of this architecture is not very obvious, and is not well motivated in the paper.
3) While it is a minor point, but the choice of the term embedding for the dot product of two items is not usual. Embeddings usually refer to vectors in R^n, and for specific entities. Here it refers to the final output, and renders the output layer in Figure 2 pointless.
Finally, I believe the paper can be improved by focusing more on motivating architectural choices, and being more concise in your description. The paper is currently very long (11 pages) and I strongly encourage you to shorten it.
