This paper presents a semi-supervised technique for "self-ensembling" where the model uses a consensus prediction (computed from previous epochs) as a target to regress to, in addition to the usual supervised learning loss. This has connections to the "dark knowledge" idea, ladder networks work is shown in this paper to be a promising technique for scenarios with few labeled examples (but not only). The paper presents two versions of the idea: one which is computationally expensive (and high variance) in that it needs two passes through the same example at a given step, and a temporal ensembling method that is stabler, cheaper computationally but more memory hungry and requires an extra hyper-parameter. 
My thoughts on this work are mostly positive. The drawbacks that I see are that the temporal ensembling work requires potentially a lot of memory, and non-trivial infrastructure / book-keeping for imagenet-sized experiments. I am quite confused by the Figure 2 / Section 3.4 experiments about tolerance to noisy labels: it's very incredible to me that by making 90% of the labels random one can still train a classifier that is either 30% accurate or ~78% accurate (depending on whether or not temporal ensembling was used). I don't see how that can happen, basically.
Minor stuff:
Please bold the best-in-category results in your tables. 
I think it would be nice to talk about the ramp-up of w(t) in the main paper. 
The authors should consider putting the state of the art results for the fully-supervised case in their tables, instead of just their own.
I am confused as to why the authors chose not to use more SVHN examples. The stated reason that it'd be "too easy" seems a bit contrived: if they used all examples it would also make it easy to compare to previous work.
