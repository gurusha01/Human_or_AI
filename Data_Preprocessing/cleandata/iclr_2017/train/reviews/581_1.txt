This paper has no machine learning algorithmic contribution: it just uses the the same combination  of LSTM and bivariate mixture density network as Graves, and the detailed explanation in the appendix even misses one key essential point: how are the Gaussian parameters obtained as a transformation of the output of the LSTM.
There are also no numerical evaluation suggesting that the algorithm is some form of improvement over the state-of-the-art.
So I do not think such a paper is appropriate for a conference like ICLR. The part describing the handwriting tasks and the data transformation is well written and interesting to read, it could be valuable work for a conference more focused on handwriting recognition, but I am no expert in the field.
