The paper presents an interesting framework for image generation, which stitches the foreground and background to form an image. This is obviously a reasonable approach there is clearly a foreground object. However, real world images are often quite complicated, which may contain multiple layers of composition, instead of a simple foreground-background layer. How would the proposed method deal with such situations?
Overall, this is a reasonable work that approaches an important problem from a new angle. Yet, I think sizable efforts remain needed to make it a generic methodology.
