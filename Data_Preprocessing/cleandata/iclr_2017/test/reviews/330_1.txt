This paper discusses a method for computing vector representations for documents by using a skip-gram style learning mechanism with an added regularizer in the form of a global context vector with various bits of drop out. While none of the individual components proposed in this paper are new, I believe that the combination in this fashion is. Further, I appreciated the detailed analysis of model behaviour in section 3.
The main downside to this submission is in its relative weakness on the empirical front. Arguably there are more interesting tasks than sentiment analysis and k-way classification! Likewise, why waste 2/3 of a page on t-sne projections rather than use that space for further analysis?
While I am a bit disappointed by this reduced evaluation and agree with the other reviewers concerning soft baselines, I think this paper should be accepted: it's an interesting algorithm, nicely composed and very efficient, so it's reasonable to assume that other readers might have use for some of the ideas presented here.
