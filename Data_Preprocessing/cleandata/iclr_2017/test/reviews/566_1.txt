The paper proposes to perform active learning using pool selection of deep learning mini-batches using an approximation of the bayesian posterior. Several terms are in turn approximated.
The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) bayesian inference approach to active learning, the various approximations, and more generally the theoretical framework is very interesting but difficult to follow.
The paper is written in poor English and is sometimes a bit painful to read.
Alternative Active learning strategies and techniques do not need to be described with such detail. On the other hand, the proposed approach has a lot of complex approximations which would benefit from a more detailed/structured presentation. Another dataset would be a big plus (both datasets concern gray digits and USPS and are arguably somewhat similar).
