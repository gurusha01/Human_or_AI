This is a well written, organized, and presented paper that I enjoyed reading.  I commend the authors on their attention to the narrative and the explanations.  While it did not present any new methodology or architecture, it instead addressed an important application of predicting the medications a patient is using, given the record of billing codes.  The dataset they use is impressive and useful and, frankly, more interesting than the typical toy datasets in machine learning.  That said, the investigation of those results was not as deep as I thought it should have been in an empirical/applications paper.  Despite their focus on the application, I was encouraged to see the authors use cutting edge choices (eg Keras, adadelta, etc) in their architecture.  A few points of criticism:
-The numerical results are in my view too brief.  Fig 4 is anecdotal, Fig 5 is essentially a negative result (tSNE is only in some places interpretable), so that leaves Table 1.  I recognize there is only one dataset, but this does not offer a vast amount of empirical evidence and analysis that one might expect out of a paper with no major algorithmic/theoretical advances.  To be clear I don't think this is disqualifying or deeply concerning; I simply found it a bit underwhelming.
- To be constructive, re the results I would recommend removing Fig 5 and replacing that with some more meaningful analysis of performance.  I found Fig 5 to be mostly uninformative, other than as a negative result, which I think can be stated in a sentence rather than in a large figure.
- There is a bit of jargon used and expertise required that may not be familiar to the typical ICLR reader.  I saw that another reviewer suggested perhaps ICLR is not the right venue for this work.  While I certainly see the reviewer's point that a medical or healthcare venue may be more suitable, I do want to cast my vote of keeping this paper here... our community benefits from more thoughtful and in depth applications. Instead I think this can be addressed by tightening up those points of jargon and making the results more easy to evaluate by an ICLR reader (that is, as it stands now researchers without medical experience have to take your results after Table 1 on faith, rather than getting to apply their well-trained quantitative eye). 
Overall, a nice paper.
