This paper introduces a new reinforcement learning environment called Â« The Retro Learning Environment", that interfaces with the open-source LibRetro API to offer access to various emulators and associated games (i.e. similar to the Atari 2600 Arcade Learning Environment, but more generic). The first supported platform is the SNES, with 5 games (more consoles and games may be added later). Authors argue that SNES games pose more challenges than Atari's (due to more complex graphics, AI and game mechanics). Several DQN variants are evaluated in experiments, and it is also proposed to compare learning algorihms by letting them compete against each other in multiplayer games.
I like the idea of going toward more complex games than those found on Atari 2600, and having an environment where new consoles and games can easily be added sounds promising. With OpenAI Universe and DeepMind Lab that just came out, though, I am not sure we really need another one right now. Especially since using ROMs of emulated games we do not own is technically illegal: it looks like this did not cause too much trouble for Atari but it might start raising eyebrows if the community moves to more advanced and recent games, especially some Nintendo still makes money from.
Besides the introduction of the environment, it is good to have DQN benchmarks on five games, but this does not add a lot of value. The authors also mention as contribution "A new benchmarking technique, allowing algorithms to compete against each other, rather than playing against the in-game AI", but this seems a bit exaggerated to me: the idea of pitting AIs against each other has been at the core of many AI competitions for decades, so it is hardly something new. The finding that reinforcement learning algorithms tend to specialize to their opponent is also not particular surprising.
Overall I believe this is an ok paper but I do not feel it brings enough to the table for a major conference. This does not mean, however, that this new environment won't find a spot in the (now somewhat crowded) space of game-playing frameworks.
Other small comments:
- There are lots of typos (way too many to mention them all)
- It is said that Infinite Mario "still serves as a benchmark platform", however as far as I know it had to be shutdown due to Nintendo not being too happy about it
- "RLE requires an emulator and a computer version of the console game (ROM file) upon initialization rather than a ROM file only. The emulators are provided with RLE" => how is that different from ALE that requires the emulator Stella which is also provided with ALE?
- Why is there no DQN / DDDQN result on Super Mario?
- It is not clear if Figure 2 displays the F-Zero results using reward shaping or not
- The Du et al reference seems incomplete
