The authors proposed to learn embeddings of users and items by using deep neural network for a recommendation task. The resulting method has only minor differences from the previous CDL, in which neural networks were also used for recommendation tasks. In the experiments, since the proposed method, DualNets have use more item features than WMF and CDL, the comparisons are unfair.
