The authors have grouped recent work in convolutional neural network design (specifically with respect to image classification) to identify core design principles guiding the field at large. The 14 principles they produce (along with associated references) include a number of useful and correct observations that would be an asset to anyone unfamiliar with the field. The authors explore a number of architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 guided by these principles.
The authors have collected a quality set of references on the subject and grouped them well which is valuable for young researchers. Clearly the authors explored a many of architectural changes as part of their experiments and publicly available code base is always nice.
Overall the writing seems to jump around a bit and the motivations behind some design principles feel lost in the confusion. For example, "Design Pattern 4: Increase Symmetry argues for architectural symmetry as a sign of beauty and quality" is presented as one of 14 core design principles without any further justification. Similarly "Design Pattern 6: Over-train includes any training method where the network is trained on a harder problem than necessary to improve generalization performance of inference" is presented in the middle of a paragraph with no supporting references or further explanation.
The experimental portion of this paper feels scattered with many different approaches being presented based on subsets of the design principles. In general, these approaches either are minor modifications of existing networks (different FractalNet pooling strategies) or are novel architectures that do not perform well. The exception being the Fractal-of-Fractal network which achieves slightly improved accuracy but also introduces many more network parameters (increased capacity) over the original FractalNet.
Preliminary rating:
It is a useful and perhaps noble task to collect and distill research from many sources to find patterns (and perhaps gaps) in the state of a field; however, some of the patterns presented do not seem well developed and include principles that are poorly explained. Furthermore, the innovative architectures motivated by the design principles either fall short or achieve slightly better accuracy by introducing many more parameters (Fractal-Of-Fractal networks). For a paper addressing the topic of higher level design trends, I would appreciate additional rigorous experimentation around each principle rather than novel architectures being presented.
