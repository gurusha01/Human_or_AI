I appreciate the work but I do not think the paper is clear enough. 
Moreover, the authors say "local minimia" ~70 times but do not show (except for Figure 11?) that the solutions found are not necessarily local minima. 
The authors do not talk about that fact that slices of a non-convex problem can look like the ones they show. 
It is well-known that the first-order methods may just fail to deal with certain non-convex ill-conditioned problems even in low-dimensional noiseless cases, the place/solution where they fail to make progress is not necessarily a local minimum. 
Some sentences like the one given below suggest that the study is too superficial:  
"One of the interesting empirical observation is that we often observe is that the incremental improvement
of optimization methods decreases rapidly even in non-convex problems."
