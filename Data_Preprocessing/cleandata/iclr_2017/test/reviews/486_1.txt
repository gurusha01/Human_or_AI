The paper develops a simple and reasonable algorithm for graph node prediction/classification. The formulations are very intuitive and lead to a simple CNN based training and can easily leverage existing GPU speedups. 
Experiments are thorough and compare with many reasonable baselines on large and real benchmark datasets. Although, I am not quite aware of the literature on other methods and there may be similar alternatives as link and node prediction is an old problem. I still think the approach is quite simple and reasonably supported by good evaluations.
