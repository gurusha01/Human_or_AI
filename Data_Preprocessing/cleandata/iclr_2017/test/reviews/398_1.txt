The authors of the paper set out to answer the question whether chaotic behaviour is a necessary ingredient for RNNs to perform well on some tasks. For that question's sake, they propose an architecture which is designed to not have chaos. The subsequent experiments validate the claim that chaos is not necessary.
This paper is refreshing. Instead of proposing another incremental improvement, the authors start out with a clear hypothesis and test it. This might set the base for future design principles of RNNs.
The only downside is that the experiments are only conducted on tasks which are known to be not that demanding from a dynamical systems perspective; it would have been nice if the authors had traversed the set of data sets more to find data where chaos is actually necessary.
