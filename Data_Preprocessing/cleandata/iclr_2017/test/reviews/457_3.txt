Nice idea but not complete, model size is not reduced by the large factors found in one of your references (Song 2016), where they go to 5 bits, but this is ontop of pruning which gives overall 49X reduction in model size of VGG (without loss of accuracy). You may achieve similar reductions with inclusion of pruning (or better since you go to 4 bits with no loss) but we should see this in the paper, so at the moment it is difficult to compare
