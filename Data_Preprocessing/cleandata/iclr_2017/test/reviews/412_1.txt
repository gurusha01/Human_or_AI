This paper presents a novel layer-wise optimization approach for learning CNN with piecewise linear nonlinearities.  The proposed approach trains piecewise linear CNNs layer by layer and reduces the sub-problem into latent structured SVM, which has been well-studied in the literature. In addition, the paper presents improvements of the BCFW algorithm used in the inner procedure. Overall, this paper is interesting. However, unfortunately, the experiment is not convincing. 
Pros:
- To my best knowledge, the proposed approach is novel, and the authors provide nice theoretical analysis.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
Cons:
- Although the proposed approach can be applied in general structured prediction problem, the experiments only conduct on a simple multi-class classification task. This makes this work less compelling. 
	
- The test accuracy performance on CIFAR-10 reported in the paper doesn't look right. The accuracy of the best model reported in this paper is 70.2% while existing work often reports 90+%. For example,
