The paper is dedicated to better understanding the optimization landscape in deep learning, in particular when explored with different optimization algorithms, and thus it also characterizes the behavior of these algorithms. It heavily re-uses the approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015). I find it hard to understand the contributions of the paper, for example: is it surprising that different algorithms reach different solutions when starting from the same initialization? It would be useful if the authors build such basic intuition in the paper. I also did not receive a clear answer to the question I posed to reviewers regarding clarifying how does the findings of the paper can contribute to future works on optimization in deep learning. And this is what I find fundamentally missing. So for example, there are probably plenty of ways to modify approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015), and similar works, and come up with interesting visualization methods for deep learning - but the question is: how is this helpful in terms of designing better algorithms, gaining more intuition how the optimization surface looks like in general, etc.? This is an interesting paper, though I am fairly confident it is a better fit for the journal than this conference. 
It would be interesting and instructive, even for sanity check, to plot the eigenspectra of the solutions recovered by the algorithms to see the order of critical points recovered.
