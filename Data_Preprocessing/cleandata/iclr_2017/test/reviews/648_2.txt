This paper proposes a method to incorporate super-resolution and inpainting in the GAN framework for semi-supervised learning using the GAN discriminative features on larger images.
The core idea of the paper is not very novel. The usefulness of the GAN discriminative features for semi-supervised learning is already established in previous works such as CatGAN, DCGAN and Salimans et al. However this paper does a good job in actually getting the semi-supervised GAN framework working on larger images such as STL-10 and Pascal datasets using the proposed context conditioning approach, and achieves the state-of-the-art on these datasets.
I think that the authors should provide the SSL-GAN baseline for the PASCAL dataset as it is very important to compare the contribution of the context conditioning idea with the standard way of using GAN for semi-supervised learning, i.e., SSL-GAN. I can't see why the SSL-GAN can not be applied to the 6464 and 9696 version of the Pascal dataset (Table 3). If they have trouble training the vanilla GAN on Pascal even on the 64*64 image size, this should be mentioned in the paper and be explained. I am concerned about this specially because CC-GAN almost matches the SSL-GAN baseline on STL-10, and CC-GAN2, to me, seems like a hacky way to improve upon the core CC-GAN idea. So it would be great to compare CC-GAN and SSL-GAN on some other dataset, even if it is a downsampled PASCAL dataset.
