This paper explores a new quantization method for both the weights and the activations that does not need re-training. In VGG-16 the method reaches compression ratios of 20x and experiences a speed-up of 15x. The paper is very well written and clearly exposes the details of the methodology and the results.
My major criticisms are three-fold: for one, the results are not compared to one of the many other pruning methods that are described in section 1.1, and as such the performance of the method is difficult to judge from the paper alone. Second, there have been several other compression schemes involving pruning, re-training and vector-quantization [e.g. 1, 2, 3] that seem to achieve much higher accuracies, compression ratios and speed-ups. Hence, for the practical application of running such networks on low-power, low-memory devices, other methods seem to be much more suited. The advantage of the given method - other then possibly reducing the time it takes to compress the network - is thus unclear. In particular, taking a pre-trained network as a starting point for a quantized model that is subsequently fine-tuned might not take much longer to process then the method given here (but maybe the authors can quantify this?). Finally, much of the speed-up and memory reduction in the VGG-model seems to arise from the three fully-connected layers, in particular the last one. The speed-up in the convolutional layers is comparably small, making me wonder how well the method would work in all-convolutional networks such as the Inception architecture.
