The author propose to use a off-policy actor-critic algorithm in a batch-setting to improve chat-bots.
The approach is well motivated and the paper is well written, except for some intuitions for why the batch version outperforms the on-line version (see comments on "clarification regarding batch vs. online setting").
The artificial experiments are instructive, and the real-world experiments were performed very thoroughly although the results show only modest improvement.
