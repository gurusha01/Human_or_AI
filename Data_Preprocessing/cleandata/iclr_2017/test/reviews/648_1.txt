This paper presents a semi-supervised algorithm for regularizing deep convolutional neural networks.
They propose an adversarial approach for image inpainting where the discriminator learns to identify whether an inpainted image comes from the data distribution or the generator, while at the same time it learns to recognize objects in an image from the data distribution. In experiments, they show the usefulness of their algorithm in which the features learned by the discriminator result in comparable or better object recognition performance to the reported state-of-the-art in two datasets.
Overall, the proposed idea seems a simple yet an effective way for regularize CNNs to improve the classification performance.
