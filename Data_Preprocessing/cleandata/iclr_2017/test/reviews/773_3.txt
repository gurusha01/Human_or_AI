This paper applies RFN for biclustering to overcome the drawbacks in FABIA. The proposed method performs best among 14 biclustering methods, However, my first concern is that from the methodological point of view, the novelty of the proposed method seems small. The authors replied to the same question which another reviewer gave, but the replies were not so convincing. 
This paper was actually difficult for me to follow. For instance, in Figure 1, a bicluster matrix is constructed as an outer product of $h$ and $w$. $h$ is a hidden unit, but what is $w$? I could not find any definition. Furthermore, I could not know how $h$ is estimated in this method. Therefore, I do NOT understand how this method performs biclustering. 
Totally, I am not sure that this paper is suitable for publication. 
Prons:
Empirical performance is good.
Cons:
Novelty of the proposed method
Some description in the paper is unclear.
