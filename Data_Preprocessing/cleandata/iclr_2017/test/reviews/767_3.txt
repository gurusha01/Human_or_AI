In the question response the authors mention and compare other works such as "Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent", but the goal of current work and that work is quite different. That work is a new form of optimization algorithm which is not the case here. And bayesian hyper-parameter optimization methods aim for multiple hyper-parameters but this work only tune one hyper-parameter.
The network architecture used for the experiments on CIFAR-10 is quite outdated and the performances are much poorer than any work that has published in last few years. So the comparison are not valid here, as if the paper claim the advantage of their method, they should use the state of the art network architecture and see if their claim still holds in that setting too.
As discussed before, the extra cost of hyper-parameter optimizers are only justified if the method could push the SOTA results in multiple modern datasets.
In summary, the general idea of having an actor-critic network as a meta-learner is an interesting idea. But the particular application proposed here does not seems to have any practical value and the reported results are very limited and it's hard to draw any conclusion about the effectiveness of the method.
