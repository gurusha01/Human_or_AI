This paper applies the pointer network architecture—wherein an attention mechanism is fashioned to point to elements of an input sequence, allowing a decoder to output said elements—in order to solve simple combinatorial optimization problems such as the well-known travelling salesman problem. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using an actor-critic method, with the actor trained using the REINFORCE method, and the critic used to estimate the reward baseline within the REINFORCE objective.
The paper is well written and easy to understand. Its use of a reinforcement learning and attention model framework to learn the structure of the space in which combinatorial problems of variable size can be tackled appears novel. Importantly, it provides an interesting research avenue for revisiting classical neural-based solutions to some combinatorial optimization problems, using recently-developed sequence-to-sequence approaches. As such, I think it merits consideration for the conference.
I have a few comments and some important reservations with the paper:
1) I take exception to the conclusion that the pointer network approach can handle general types of combinatorial optimization problems. The crux of combinatorial problems — for practical applications — lies in the complex constraints that define feasible solutions (e.g. simple generalizations of the TSP that involve time windows, or multiple salesmen). For these problems, it is no longer so simple to exclude possible solutions from the enumeration of the solution by just « striking off » previously-visited instances; in fact, for many of these problems, finding a single feasible solution might in general be a challenge. It would be relevant to include a discussion of whether the Neural Combinatorial Optimization approach could scale to these important classes of problems, and if so, how. My understanding is that this approach, as presented, would be mostly suitable for assignment problems with a very simple constraint structure.
2) The operations research literature is replete with a large number of benchmark problems that have become standard to compare solver quality. For instance, TSPLIB contains a large number of TSP instances (
