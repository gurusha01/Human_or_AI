This paper provides an interesting analysis of the conditions which enable generation of natural looking textures. The results is quite surprising, and analysis is quite thorough. 
I do think the evaluation methods require more work, but as other reviewers mentioned this could be an interesting line of work moving forwards and does not take too much from this current paper which, I think, should be accepted.
