Sorry for the late review -- I've been having technical problems with OpenReview which prevented me from posting.
This paper presents a method for learning to predict things from sets of data points. The method is a hierarchical version of the VAE, where the top layer consists of an abstract context unit that summarizes a dataset. Experiments show that the method is able to "learn to learn" by acquiring the ability to learn distributions from small numbers of examples.
Overall, this paper is a nice addition to the literature on one- or few-shot learning. The method is conceptually simple and elegant, and seems to perform well. Compared to other recent papers on one-shot learning, the proposed method is simpler, and is based on unsupervised representation learning. The paper is clearly written and a pleasure to read.
The name of the paper is overly grandiose relative to what was done; the proposed method doesn't seem to have much in common with a statistician, unless one means by that "someone who thinks up statistics". 
The experiments are well chosen, and the few-shot learning results seem pretty solid given the simplicity of the method.
The spatial MNIST dataset is interesting and might make a good toy benchmark. The inputs in Figure 4 seem pretty dense, though; shouldn't the method be able to recognize the distribution with fewer samples?  (Nitpick: the red points in Figure 4 don't seem to correspond to meaningful points as was claimed in the text.) 
Will the authors release the code?
