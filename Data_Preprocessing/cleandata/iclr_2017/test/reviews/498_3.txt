This paper puts forward a not entirely new, but also not sufficiently understood interpretation of dropout regularization. The authors derive useful theorems that estimate or put bounds on key quantities that are of interest when analyzing dropout regularized networks from their perspective. They furthermore introduce an explicit regularization term that should have a well understood impact on these key quantities. In the experimental section they convincingly show that the proposed regularization indeed has the expected effect and that their perspective on dropout is therefore useful and meaningful.
Their proposed regularization also seems to have a positive impact on the models performance but they demonstrate this only on rel. small scale benchmark problems. I therefore don't belief that this approach will have a large impact on how practitioner train models.  But their general perspective is well aligned with the recently proposed idea of "Dropout as a bayesian approximation" and the insights and theorems in this paper might enable future work in that direction.
