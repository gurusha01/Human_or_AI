This paper shows that a deep RL approach augmented with auxiliary tasks improves performance on navigation in complex environments. Specifically, A3C is used for the RL problem, and the agent is simultaneously trained on an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. While the use of auxiliary tasks to improve training of models including RL agents is not new, the main contribution here is the use of tasks that encourage learning an intrinsic representation of space and movement that enables significant improvements on maze navigation tasks.
The paper is well written, experiments are convincing, and the value of the auxiliary tasks for the problem are clear. However, the contribution is relatively incremental given previous work on RL for navigation and on auxiliary tasks. The work could become of greater interest provided broader analysis and insights on either optimal combinations of tasks for visual navigation (e.g. the value of other visual / geometry-based tasks), or on auxiliary tasks with RL in general.  As it is, it is a useful demonstration of the benefit of geometry-based auxiliary tasks for navigation, but of relatively narrow interest.
