This paper introduces a pratical large-scale visual search system for a fashion site. It uses RNN to recognize multi-label attributes and uses state-of-art faster RCNN to extract features inside those region-of-interest (ROI). The technical contribution of this paper is not clear. Most of the approaches used are standard state-of-art methods and there are not a lot of novelties in applying those methods. For multi-label recognition task, there are other available methods, e.g. using binary models, changing cross-entropy loss function, etc. There aren't any comparison between the RNN method and other simple baselines. The order of the sequential RNN prediction is not clear either. It seems that the attributes form a tree hierarchy and that is used as the order of sequence.
The paper is not well written either. Most results are reported in the internal dataset and the authors won't release the dataset.
