The authors present here a new algorithm for the effective calculation of polynomial features on Sparse Matrices. The key idea is to use a proper mapping between matrices and their polynomial versions, in order to derive an effective CSR expansion algorithm. The authors analyse the time complexity in a convincing way with experiments.
Overall, the algorithm is definitely interesting, quite simple and nice, with many possible applications. The paper is however very superficial in terms of experiments, or applications of the proposed scheme. Most importantly, the fit with the main scope of ICLR is far from obvious with this work, that should probably re-submitted to better targets.
