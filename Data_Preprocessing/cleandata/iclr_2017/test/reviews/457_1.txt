There is a great deal of ongoing interest in compressing neural network models. One line of work has focused on using low-precision representations of the model weights, even down to 1 or 2 bits. However, so far these approaches have been accompanied by a significant impact on accuracy. The paper proposes an iterative quantization scheme, in which the network weights are quantized in stages---the largest weights (in absolute value) are quantized and fixed, while unquantized weights can adapt to compensate for any resulting error. The experimental results show this is extremely effective, yielding models with 4 bit or 3 bit weights with essentially no reduction in accuracy. While at 2 bits the accuracy decreases slightly, the results are substantially better than those achieved with other quantization approaches.
Overall this paper is clear, the technique is as far as I am aware novel, the experiments are thorough and the results are very compelling, so I recommend acceptance. The paper could use another second pass for writing style and grammar. Also, the description of the pruning-inspired partitioning strategy could be clarified somewhat... e.g., the chosen splitting ratio of 50% only seems to be referenced in a figure caption and not the main text.
