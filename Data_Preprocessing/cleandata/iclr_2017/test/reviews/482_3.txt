This is a well-conducted and well-written study on the prediction of medication from diagnostic codes. The authors compared GRUs, LSTMs, feed-forward networks and random forests (making a case for why random forests should be used, instead of SVMs) and analysed the predictions and embeddings.
The authors also did address the questions of the reviewers.
My only negative point is that this work might be more relevant for a data science or medical venue rather than at ICLR.
