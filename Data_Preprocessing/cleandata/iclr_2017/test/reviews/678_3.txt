This work investigates the performance of transfer learning from resource-rich setup (BookTest, CNN/Daily Mail corpora) to low-resource (bAbI, SQuAD benchmarks) settings. Experiments show poor improvements in 0-shot learning. However, when the model is exposed to few training instances some improvements are observed.
The claims made here require a more comprehensive analysis. I criticize the use of bAbI as a low-resource real-world scenario. bAbI is designed as a unit test and is far from representing many natural language phenomena. Thus, the claims related to bAbI can only be weak evidence for questioning transfer learning high-resource to low-resource in real-world scenarios. I highly recommend using recently proposed real-world scenarios [1,2].
More importantly, the work does not explain why and how do we get improvement using transfer learning. They remotely address this by hypothesizing the knowledge of transfer is not just encoded in embeddings but also in the model. Considering the related work [3], these claims bring a marginal novelty and still "how and why" should be central in this work.
