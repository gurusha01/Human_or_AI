This paper provides an extensive analysis of the error loss function for different optimization methods. The presentation is well done and informative. The experimental procedure is clarified sufficiently well. Theoretical evaluations like this are crucial for a wide range of applications and help to better understand and improve the convergence behavior for a given system.
Pros:
- Important analysis
- Good visualizations
Cons:
- The paper describes mostly the observation that the optima vary for different methods, however doesn't attempt to explain why it happens and how to solve it (aside from batch-norm)
- Some fonts are very small (e.g. Fig. 5)
