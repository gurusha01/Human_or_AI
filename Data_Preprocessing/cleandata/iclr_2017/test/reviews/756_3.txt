This paper introduces a similarity encoder based on a standard feed-forward neural network with the aim of generating similarity-preserving embeddings. The approach is utilized to generate a simple extension of the CBOW word2vec model that transforms the learned embeddings by their average context vectors. Experiments are performed on an analogy task and named entity recognition.
While this paper offers some reasonable intuitive arguments for why a feed-forward neural network can generate good similarity-preserving embeddings, the architecture and approach is far from novel. As far as I can tell, the model is nothing more than the most vanilla neural network trained with SGD on similarity signals.
Slightly more original is the idea to use context embeddings to augment the expressive capacity of learned word representations. Of course, using explicit contextual information is not a new idea, especially for tasks like word sense disambiguation (see, e.g., 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should also be cited), but the specific method used here is original, as far as I know.
The evaluation of the method is far from convincing. The corpora used to train the embeddings are far smaller than would ever be used in practice for unsupervised or semi-supervised embedding learning. The performance on the analogy task says little about the benefit of this method for larger corpora, and, as the authors mentioned in the comments, they expect "the gain will be less significant, as the global context statistics brought in by the ConEc can also be picked up by word2vec with more training."
The argument can be made (and the authors do claim) that extrinsic evaluations are more important for real-world applications, so it is good to see experiments on NER. However, again the embeddings were trained on a very small corpus and I am not convinced that the observed benefit will persist when trained on larger corpora.
Overall, I believe this paper offers little novelty and weak experimental evidence supporting its claims. I cannot recommend it for acceptance.
