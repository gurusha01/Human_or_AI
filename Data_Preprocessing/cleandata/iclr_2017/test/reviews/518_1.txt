This paper proposes an amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method in which "a neural network is trained to mimic the SVGD dynamics". It applies the method to generative adversarial training to yield a training procedure where the discriminator is interpreted as an energy-based probabilistic model.
One criticism I have of the presentation is that a lot of time and energy is spent setting the table for a method which is claimed to be widely applicable, and the scope of the empirical evaluation is narrowed down to a single specific setting. In my view, either the paper falls short of its goal of showing how widely applicable the proposed method is, or it spends too much time setting the table for SteinGAN and not enough time evaluating it.
The consequence of this is that the empirical results are insufficient in justifying the approach proposed by the paper. As another reviewer pointed out, DCGAN is becoming outdated as a benchmark for comparison.
Qualitatively, SteinGAN samples don't look significantly better than DCGAN samples, except for the CelebA dataset. In that particular case, the DCGAN samples don't appear to be the ones presented in the original paper; where do they come from?
Quantitatively, DCGAN beats SteinGAN by a small margin for the ImageNet Inception Score and SteinGAN beats DCGAN by an even smaller margin for the CIFAR10 Inception Score. Also, in my opinion, the "testing accuracy" score is not a convincing evaluation metric: while it is true that it measures the amount of information captured in the simulated image sets, it is only sensitive to information useful for the discrimination task, not for the more general modeling task. For instance, this score is likely completely blind to information present in the background of the image.
Because of the reasons outlined above, I don't think the paper is ready for publication at ICLR.
