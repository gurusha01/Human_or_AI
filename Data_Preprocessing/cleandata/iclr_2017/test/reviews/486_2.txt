The paper introduces a method for semi-supervised learning in graphs that exploits the spectral structure of the graph in a convolutional NN implementation. The proposed algorithm has a limited complexity and it is shown to scale well on a large dataset. The comparison with baselines on different datasets show a clear jump of performance with the proposed method.
The paper is technically fine and clear, the algorithm seems to scale well, and the results on the different datasets compare very favorably with the different baselines. The algorithm is simple and training seems easy. Concerning the originality, the proposed algorithm is a simple adaptation of graph convolutional networks (ref Defferrard 2016 in the paper) to a semi-supervised transductive setting. This is clearly mentioned in the paper, but the authors could better highlight the differences and novelty wrt this reference paper. Also, there is no comparison with the family of iterative classifiers, which usually compare favorably, both in performance and training time, with regularization based approaches, although they are mostly used in inductive settings. Below are some references for this family of methods.
The authors mention that more complex filters could be learned by stacking layers but they limit their architecture to one hidden layer. They should comment on the interest of using more layers for graph classification.
