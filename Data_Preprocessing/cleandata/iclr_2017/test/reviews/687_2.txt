I did enjoy reading some of the introductions and background, in particular that of reminding readers of popular papers from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The idea of the proposal is straight forward: remove neurons based on the estimated change in the loss function from the packpropagation estimate with either first or second order backpropagation. The results are as expected that the first order method is worse then the second order method which in turn is worse than the brute force method.
However, there are many reasons why I think that this work is not appropriate for ICLR. For one, there is now a much stronger comprehension of weight decay algorithms and their relation to Bayesian priors which has not been mentioned at all. I would think that any work in this regime would require at least some comments about this. Furthermore, there are many statements in the text that are not necessarily true, in particular in light of deep networks with modern regularization methods. For example, the authors state that the most accurate method is what they call brute-force. However, this assumes that the effects of each neurons are independent which might not be the case. So the serial order of removal is not necessarily the best. 
I also still think that this paper is unnecessarily long and the idea and the results could have been delivered in a much compressed way. I also don't think just writing a Q&A section is not enough, and the points should be included in the paper.
