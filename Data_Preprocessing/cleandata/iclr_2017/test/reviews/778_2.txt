I do need to see the results in a clear table. Original results and results when compression is applied for all the tasks. In any case, i would like to see the results when the compression is applied to state of the art nets where the float representation is important. For instance a network with 0.5% - 0.8% in MNIST. A Imagenet lower that 5% - 10%. Some of this results are feasible with float representation but probably imposible for restricted representations.
