This work proposed a simple but strong baseline for parametric texture synthesis. In empirical experiments, samples generated by the baseline composed by multi-scale and random filters sometime rival the VGG-based model which has multi-layer and pre-trained filters. The authors concluded that texture synthesis does not necessarily depend on deep hierarchical representations or the learned feature maps. 
This work is indeed interesting and insightful. However, the conclusions are needed to be further testified (especially for deep hierarchical representations). Firstly, all of generated samples by both VGG and single layer model are not perfect and much worse than the results from non-parametric methods.  Besides VGG-based model seems to do better in inpainting task in Figure 7. Last but not least, would a hierarchical model (instead of lots of filters with different size) handle multi-scale more efficiently?
