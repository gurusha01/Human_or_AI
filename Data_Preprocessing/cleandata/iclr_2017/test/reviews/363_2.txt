This paper proposes a compare-aggregate framework that performs word-level matching followed by aggregation with convolutional neural networks. It compares six different comparison functions and evaluates them on four datasets. Extensive experimental results have been reported and compared against various published baselines.
The paper is well written overall.
A few detailed comments:
* page 4, line5: including a some -> including some
* What's the benefit of the preprocessing and attention step? Can you provide the results without it?
* Figure 2 is hard to read, esp. when on printed hard copy. Please enhance the quality.
