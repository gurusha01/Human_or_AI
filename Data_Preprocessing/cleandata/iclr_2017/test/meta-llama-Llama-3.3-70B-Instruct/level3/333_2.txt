Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes an innovative approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). The authors design an algorithm that trains a policy network (actor) to decide the learning rate at each step during training and a value network (critic) to provide feedback about the quality of the decision. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to good convergence of SGD, prevents overfitting to a certain extent, and results in better performance than human-designed competitors.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The key reasons for this choice are:
1. The paper provides a well-motivated and interesting analysis of the conditions that enable the generation of natural-looking textures, with surprising and thorough results.
2. The approach is well-placed in the literature, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field by proposing a novel algorithm that leverages RL techniques to learn learning rates.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a clear and well-structured approach to learning learning rates, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The authors have also provided a thorough analysis of the related work and have compared their method with several baseline methods. The results show that the proposed method achieves similar convergence speed to the baseline methods and slightly better test accuracy.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details about the hyperparameter tuning process and the computational resources required to train the actor and critic networks. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details about the state function χ(·) used to process the model parameters and training data?
2. How did you choose the discount factor γ and the learning rate for the actor and critic networks?
3. Have you considered applying the proposed method to other variants of SGD methods, such as momentum SGD or RMSprop?
