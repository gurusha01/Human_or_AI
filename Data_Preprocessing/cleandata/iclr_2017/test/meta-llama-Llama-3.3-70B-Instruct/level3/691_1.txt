Summary
The paper introduces a new environment called Retro Learning Environment (RLE) for reinforcement learning, focusing on Super Nintendo games with a claimed support for other interfaces. The authors propose that RLE could be a significant contribution to the field by providing new challenging domains for research, similar to the Atari Learning Environment (ALE). However, the paper's main focus is on presenting the RLE framework and its potential, rather than providing new scientific results or significant algorithmic contributions.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the lack of significant scientific contribution, and (2) the paper's results, particularly those related to rivalry training, are not well-presented and lack polish.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's introduction of RLE is interesting, but the experiments conducted using existing algorithms show that domain knowledge and techniques like reward shaping and policy shaping can be helpful, but these findings are not particularly surprising. The concept of rivalry training is introduced, but its evaluation methodology is questionable, as it trains against a different opponent but is evaluated against the in-game AI. Furthermore, the paper's scientific results are not well-presented, which is disappointing.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should focus on providing more significant scientific contributions, such as new algorithms or theoretical results. Additionally, the authors should polish their presentation of results, particularly those related to rivalry training, to make them more convincing and reliable. The authors should also consider alternative venues for their work, such as mloss.org or JMLR, which may be more suitable for papers that focus on introducing new environments or frameworks.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the significance of RLE and how it differs from existing environments like ALE?
* How do you plan to address the limitations of your evaluation methodology for rivalry training?
* Can you provide more convincing results or analysis to support the effectiveness of your approach?
