Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for fast computations on GPUs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the experimental evaluation, although extensive, lacks a thorough analysis of the results, making it difficult to fully understand the significance of the findings. Secondly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the RFN model and its parameters, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other biclustering methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents an interesting approach to biclustering, and the results on synthetic and real-world datasets are promising. However, the experimental evaluation could be improved by providing more detailed analysis of the results, such as statistical significance tests and more comprehensive comparisons with other methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the RFN model and its parameters, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other biclustering methods.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests and more comprehensive comparisons with other methods. Additionally, the authors could provide more insight into the RFN model and its parameters, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with other biclustering methods. This would help to strengthen the paper and provide a more convincing argument for the effectiveness of RFNs for biclustering.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the RFN model and its parameters, and how they were chosen for the experiments?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of overfitting in the RFN model, particularly when dealing with large datasets?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive comparisons with other biclustering methods, including a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?
