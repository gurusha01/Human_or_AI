Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. The authors introduce a context-conditional generative adversarial network (CC-GAN) that learns to fill in missing patches in images and uses the discriminator to learn features that generalize to object classification tasks. The approach is evaluated on STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets, achieving comparable or superior performance to existing semi-supervised methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper lacks a thorough discussion on weight decay algorithms and their relation to Bayesian priors, which is a crucial aspect in the current understanding of the field. Secondly, the paper makes statements that are not necessarily true, such as assuming independent effects of neurons, which may not hold in deep networks with modern regularization methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's proposal is straightforward, involving the removal of neurons based on estimated loss function changes using first or second-order backpropagation. However, the results show that the first-order method is worse than the second-order method, which in turn is worse than the brute force method. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Additionally, the paper's introduction and background are well-written, but the overall presentation could be more concise.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on weight decay algorithms and their relation to Bayesian priors. Additionally, the authors should revisit their assumptions about independent effects of neurons and provide more rigorous justification for their claims. The inclusion of a Q&A section is not sufficient, and the authors should integrate these points into the main paper. The paper could also benefit from a more concise presentation of the idea and results.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on how the CC-GAN approach addresses the issue of independent effects of neurons in deep networks?
2. How do you plan to extend the CC-GAN approach to larger image sizes, and what are the potential limitations of the current approach?
3. Can you provide more insights into the hyperparameter selection process, particularly the choice of Î»c, and how it affects the performance of the CC-GAN model?
