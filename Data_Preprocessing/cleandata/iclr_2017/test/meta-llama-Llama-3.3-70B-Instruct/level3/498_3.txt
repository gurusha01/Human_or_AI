Summary
The paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning approach based on in-painting with an adversarial loss, leveraging the concept of context-conditional generative adversarial networks (CC-GANs). The authors propose a framework that combines a generative model with a discriminative model, where the generator is trained to fill in missing patches in images, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake in-painted images. The approach is evaluated on two classification benchmarks, STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007, and demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing semi-supervised methods.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed CC-GAN approach in semi-supervised learning. The paper presents a well-motivated and well-placed approach in the literature, and the experimental results demonstrate the potential of the method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles the specific question of semi-supervised learning with a new and innovative approach, which is well-aligned with the current research trends in deep learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, and the experimental results are thorough and well-presented. The comparison to existing methods and the analysis of the results are also well-done, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of the approach.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more details on the training procedures and hyperparameter tuning, as well as more visualizations of the in-painted images and generated samples. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more analysis on the effect of the low-resolution conditioning on the generator's performance, and how it can be applied to larger image sizes. I would also like to see more discussion on the potential applications of the CC-GAN approach beyond semi-supervised learning, such as image generation and editing.
Questions for the Authors
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How did you select the hyperparameters for the CC-GAN model, and what was the effect of different hyperparameter settings on the performance?
* Can you provide more details on the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, and how they were designed?
* How do you think the CC-GAN approach can be extended to other domains, such as natural language processing or speech recognition?
* What are the potential limitations and challenges of the CC-GAN approach, and how can they be addressed in future work?
