Summary
The paper introduces a Chaos-Free Network (CFN), a gated recurrent neural network that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. The CFN has simple, predictable, and non-chaotic dynamics, which is in contrast to more standard gated architectures that exhibit chaotic behavior.
Decision
I have a weak tendency towards accepting the submission, with the primary reason being that the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to designing recurrent neural networks. However, I have some concerns regarding the comparison to alternative methods and the lack of clarity in the results on the mobile navigation scenario.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of chaos in recurrent neural networks and presents a simple yet effective solution in the form of the CFN. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of the CFN and demonstrate its performance on the word-level language modeling task. However, I question the method's advantage and disadvantage over multi-task learning, particularly in general multiple task settings, and find the authors' reply unsatisfactory.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest comparing the proposed gated neural network architecture to a hard gated unit as a possible baseline to affect the conclusion. Additionally, the authors should provide more clarity on the results of the mobile navigation scenario and compare their approach to alternative methods. I would like the authors to answer the following questions: (1) How does the CFN perform on tasks that require longer-term dependencies? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the trade-offs between the simplicity of the CFN and its performance on various tasks? (3) How does the CFN compare to other recurrent neural network architectures in terms of interpretability and mathematical understanding?
Conference Guidelines
To answer the conference guidelines, I would say that:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the design of a recurrent neural network that avoids chaotic dynamics while achieving good performance on word-level language modeling tasks.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the paper provides a clear and thorough analysis of the dynamics of the CFN.
3. The paper supports its claims with empirical results, but I have some concerns regarding the comparison to alternative methods and the lack of clarity in the results on the mobile navigation scenario.
