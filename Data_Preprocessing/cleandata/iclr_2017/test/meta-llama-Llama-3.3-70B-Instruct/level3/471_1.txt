Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to train stochastic neural networks for probabilistic inference, leveraging Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to iteratively adjust the network parameters and minimize the KL divergence with the target distribution. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, called SteinGAN, in generating realistic-looking images competitive with state-of-the-art results produced by generative adversarial networks (GANs).
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's contribution, while well-motivated and clearly written, is modest and builds upon existing off-policy actor-critic methods. Secondly, the primary dataset used, containing 6000 conversations for restaurant recommendations, is very small compared to other datasets in the literature, which may limit the generalizability of the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method. However, the contribution is incremental, and the paper does not significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the field. Furthermore, the small dataset used may not be representative of more complex dialogue scenarios, which may limit the applicability of the results. The paper's effectiveness in improving dialogue generation with larger amounts of unsupervised data remains to be seen.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors could consider using larger and more diverse datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of their method. Additionally, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with existing methods, including GANs, to highlight the advantages and limitations of their approach. The authors could also consider exploring the theoretical foundations of their method, including the convergence properties of the SVGD algorithm and the implications for probabilistic inference.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the authors plan to address the scalability of their method to larger and more complex datasets?
2. Can the authors provide more detailed comparisons with existing methods, including GANs, to highlight the advantages and limitations of their approach?
3. How do the authors plan to explore the theoretical foundations of their method, including the convergence properties of the SVGD algorithm and the implications for probabilistic inference?
