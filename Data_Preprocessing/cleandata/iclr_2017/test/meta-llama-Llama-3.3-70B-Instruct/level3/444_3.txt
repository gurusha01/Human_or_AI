Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel method for extracting rule-based classifiers from trained LSTM models, which is applied to a factoid question-answering task with comparable performance to the original LSTM. The analysis of extracted rules provides insight into the features picked up by the LSTM model, with most rules consisting of only two or three words. The approach taken is relatively inflexible, but experimenting with different scores for picking salient words yields comparable performance, suggesting the extracted rules mimic the RNN closely.
Decision: Reject
The primary reason for this decision is the presence of several technical issues and errors in the paper, including over-parametrization, unclear sections, and mistakes in equations and tables. These issues need to be addressed for clarity and accuracy. Additionally, while the paper's approach is novel and shows promise, the results are not significantly better than existing methods, and the analysis of extracted rules could be more in-depth.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's method for extracting rule-based classifiers from trained LSTM models is a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing. The analysis of extracted rules provides valuable insights into the features picked up by the LSTM model, which could be useful for understanding the decision-making process of the model. However, the paper's technical issues and errors detract from its overall quality and make it difficult to fully assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should address the technical issues and errors, provide more clarity and detail in the methodology and analysis sections, and consider experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve the performance of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors could provide more examples of extracted rules and analyze them in more depth to provide a better understanding of the features picked up by the LSTM model.
