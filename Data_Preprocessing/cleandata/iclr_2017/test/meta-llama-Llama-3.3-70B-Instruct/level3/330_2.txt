Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model. The GCN model uses an efficient layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors claim that their model outperforms several recently proposed methods by a significant margin while being computationally efficient. The paper also provides a theoretical motivation for the GCN model and demonstrates its effectiveness on various network datasets.
