Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data using a variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs. The authors introduce a simple and well-behaved layer-wise propagation rule for neural network models that can be motivated from a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. The model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets, including citation networks and a knowledge graph dataset, and show that it outperforms related methods by a significant margin.
Decision
Based on the review, I decide to Reject the paper. The main reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of expertise: I lack the necessary expertise to provide solid comments on the paper's techniques, and can only offer an educated guess.
2. Relevance to ICLR: The paper's topic may not be highly relevant to the focus of ICLR, according to my impression.
Supporting Arguments
While the paper presents an interesting approach to semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, I have some concerns about the quality of writing, particularly in the literature review and experiment analysis sections. The paper could benefit from more careful editing to improve clarity and readability.
Additionally, I would like to see more discussion on the limitations of the approach and potential future directions for research. The authors mention some limitations, such as the assumption of locality and equal importance of self-connections vs. edges to neighboring nodes, but do not provide a clear plan for addressing these limitations.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Provide more detailed explanations of the technical concepts and notation used in the paper.
* Include more visualizations and examples to illustrate the approach and its applications.
* Discuss the potential applications of the approach beyond the datasets used in the experiments.
* Consider using more robust evaluation metrics and comparing the approach to a wider range of baseline methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more intuition on why the first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions is sufficient for the task of semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data?
* How do you plan to address the limitations of the approach, such as the assumption of locality and equal importance of self-connections vs. edges to neighboring nodes?
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and hyperparameter tuning process used in the paper?
