Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper explores the effectiveness of transfer learning in text comprehension tasks, specifically in reading comprehension. The authors investigate whether models trained on large-scale datasets can be fine-tuned to perform well on smaller, low-resource datasets. They conduct experiments using two pre-training datasets, BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, and evaluate the performance on two target datasets, bAbI and SQuAD. The results show that while pre-training alone does not lead to significant improvements, fine-tuning the pre-trained models with a small number of examples from the target dataset leads to notable performance gains.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Reject the paper. The two key reasons for this decision are:
1. Lack of representativeness of bAbI as a low-resource real-world scenario: The paper uses bAbI as a low-resource dataset, but bAbI is an artificial dataset designed to test specific reasoning abilities, which may not be representative of natural language phenomena. This limits the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios.
2. Insufficient analysis of why and how transfer learning improves performance: The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to the success of transfer learning in this context. Understanding the "how and why" of transfer learning is crucial to advancing the field, and the paper falls short in this regard.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's results show that pre-training alone does not lead to significant improvements on the bAbI dataset, which suggests that the skills learned from the pre-training datasets may not be directly applicable to the target dataset. While fine-tuning with a small number of examples from the target dataset leads to improvements, the paper does not investigate the underlying factors contributing to this success. Furthermore, the use of bAbI as a low-resource dataset may not be representative of real-world scenarios, which limits the applicability of the results.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Use more representative low-resource datasets that reflect real-world scenarios.
* Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the success of transfer learning, such as the role of word embeddings, context encoders, and fine-tuning.
* Investigate the impact of pre-training dataset size and quality on the performance of the model.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How do the authors plan to address the limitations of using bAbI as a low-resource dataset?
* What specific factors do the authors believe contribute to the success of transfer learning in this context, and how do they plan to investigate these factors further?
* How do the authors plan to extend their work to more realistic low-resource scenarios, such as those encountered in real-world applications?
