Summary
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. The approach, called Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CC-GANs), combines a generative model that fills in missing patches in an image with a discriminative model that distinguishes between real and fake images. The authors evaluate their approach on STL-10 and PASCAL VOC datasets, achieving performance comparable to or better than existing semi-supervised methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, primarily due to two key reasons. Firstly, the paper's results are incomplete, as they do not include AlexNet results, which are necessary for a fair comparison with prior work. Secondly, the experimental evaluation on PASCAL VOC is not satisfactory due to the use of a different network architecture, VGG, which makes comparison with prior work unfair.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's conceptual novelty is limited, as it combines two existing ideas: using the discriminator of a GAN as a feature learner and performing unsupervised feature learning with image inpainting. While the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two datasets, the lack of completeness in their results and the unfair comparison with prior work on PASCAL VOC undermine the significance of their findings. Furthermore, the qualitative inpainting results are incomplete, lacking comparison with previous methods and quantitative results, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more comprehensive results, including AlexNet results, and ensure a fair comparison with prior work on PASCAL VOC. Additionally, they should provide more detailed qualitative and quantitative inpainting results, including comparisons with previous methods. This would help to strengthen the paper's contributions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide AlexNet results to facilitate a fair comparison with prior work?
2. How do you plan to address the issue of using a different network architecture on PASCAL VOC, and can you provide results using a consistent architecture?
3. Can you provide more detailed qualitative and quantitative inpainting results, including comparisons with previous methods, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach?
