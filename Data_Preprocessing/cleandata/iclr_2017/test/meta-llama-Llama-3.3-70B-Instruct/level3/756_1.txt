The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture, called Doubly Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs), models the information flow in a tree with two separate recurrent modules: one carrying ancestral information and the other carrying fraternal information. The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction.
The paper claims to contribute to the field by proposing a new architecture that can generate tree-structured objects from scratch, without relying on pre-defined tree structures or node labels. The authors evaluate their approach on several tasks, including synthetic tree recovery, mapping sentences to functional programs, and machine translation.
I decide to reject this paper for two main reasons. Firstly, the concept of embedding data instances into a low-dimensional space that preserves similarity is not new and has been done by pre-trained embeddings like auto-encoders and word2vec. Secondly, the method proposed in the paper is not novel, especially in the case of word/context embeddings, and is similar to a similarity function presented in "A Simple Word Embedding Model for Lexical Substitution" by Melamud et al. in 2015.
The evaluation of the method could be improved by using existing benchmarks for word embeddings in context, which are plentiful and well-established. The paper's experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, but the comparison to other methods is limited, and the results are not significantly better than the baseline methods.
To improve the paper, I would suggest the authors to provide a more thorough review of the related work, highlighting the differences and similarities between their approach and existing methods. Additionally, the authors should consider using more established benchmarks and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: 
* How does the proposed architecture differ from existing methods for generating tree-structured objects, such as recursive neural networks and tree-structured decoders?
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a doubly recurrent neural network architecture compared to other approaches?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of exposure bias in the proposed architecture, which can lead to suboptimal performance in practice? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to generating tree-structured objects, it lacks novelty and a thorough evaluation of the proposed method. With additional improvements and clarifications, the paper could be considered for acceptance.
