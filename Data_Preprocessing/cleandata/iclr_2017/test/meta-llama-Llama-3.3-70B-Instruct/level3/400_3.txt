Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, introducing a scalable and efficient neural network model that operates directly on graphs. The model, called Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), uses a layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors claim that their model outperforms recent related methods by a significant margin, while being computationally efficient. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on several network datasets, including citation networks and a knowledge graph dataset.

Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach and potential future directions. Specifically, I would like to know more about the following:
* How does the model's performance change with the number of layers, and what are the trade-offs between model depth and computational efficiency?
* Can the model be applied to graphs with directed edges and edge features, and if so, how would the propagation rule need to be modified?
* Are there any potential applications of the proposed model to other domains, such as computer vision or natural language processing?
I would also like to see more statistics about the datasets used in the experiments, such as the number of nodes, edges, and classes, to better understand the task's difficulty and the model's performance. Additionally, I would like to know more about the hyperparameter tuning process and how the authors selected the optimal hyperparameters for each dataset.
