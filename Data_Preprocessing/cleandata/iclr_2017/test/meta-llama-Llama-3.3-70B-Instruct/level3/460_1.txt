Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Doubly Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs), specifically designed for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture models the flow of information in a tree with two separate recurrent modules: one carrying ancestral information and the other carrying fraternal information. The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DRNNs in recovering latent tree structure in sequences and mapping sentences to simple functional programs.
Decision and Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons:
1. Novel Architecture: The proposed DRNN architecture is a significant contribution to the field of neural networks, as it addresses the challenge of generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The use of separate recurrent modules for ancestral and fraternal information flow is a innovative approach.
2. Empirical Results: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DRNNs in various tasks, including synthetic tree recovery, mapping sentences to functional programs, and machine translation. The results show that DRNNs outperform baseline models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in some cases.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of generating tree-structured objects, and the proposed architecture is well-placed in the literature. The authors provide a detailed description of the DRNN architecture and its components, including the ancestral and fraternal recurrent modules, and the topological prediction mechanism. The experimental results are thorough and well-analyzed, and the authors provide a detailed comparison with baseline models.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the individual contributions of each component of the DRNN architecture to the overall performance gain. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more results on the application of DRNNs to other tasks, such as natural language parsing or program synthesis.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* How do the authors plan to scale the DRNN architecture to larger and more complex tree structures?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters and the optimization process for the DRNN architecture?
* How do the authors plan to address the issue of exposure bias in the DRNN architecture, where the model is trained on gold-standard labels but generates samples that may not be identical to the gold-standard labels?
