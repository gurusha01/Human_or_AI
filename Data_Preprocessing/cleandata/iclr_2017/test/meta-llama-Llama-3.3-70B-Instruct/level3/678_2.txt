Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a study on transfer learning for question answering from stories, exploring the possibility of using data-rich domains to pre-train models and then apply them to domains where training data is scarce. The authors investigate the transferability of skills learned from two large-scale reading comprehension datasets, BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, to two target tasks: bAbI, a set of artificial tasks designed to test specific reasoning abilities, and SQuAD, a question-answering dataset closer to real-world applications.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons being:
1. Limited transfer learning: The results show that transfer learning is almost non-existent between datasets, which contradicts the initial hypothesis of transferring between QA datasets.
2. Lack of sharp analysis: The paper fails to provide a thorough analysis of the failure modes and reasons behind the negative results, which could have indicated potential research directions.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experiments demonstrate that pre-trained models perform poorly on the target tasks without any target-domain adjustment, and even with target adjustment, the results are not competitive with state-of-the-art models. The authors also fail to provide insights into the impact of syntax and word/entity/ngrams distributions overlap between datasets, which could have been valuable takeaways.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Provide a more detailed analysis of the failure modes and reasons behind the negative results.
* Investigate the impact of syntax and word/entity/ngrams distributions overlap between datasets on transfer learning.
* Consider using more advanced models or techniques to improve transfer learning.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* Can you provide more insights into why the pre-trained models performed poorly on the target tasks without target-domain adjustment?
* How do you plan to address the limited transfer learning between datasets in future work?
* Can you elaborate on the potential applications of transfer learning in reading comprehension, despite the negative results presented in this paper?
