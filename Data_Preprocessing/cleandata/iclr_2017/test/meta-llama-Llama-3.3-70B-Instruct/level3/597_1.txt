This paper presents a novel approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems using a pointer network architecture with reinforcement learning and attention model framework. The authors apply this approach to the travelling salesman problem, a classic example of a combinatorial optimization problem.
The paper's approach appears to be novel and provides an interesting research avenue for revisiting classical neural-based solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using sequence-to-sequence approaches. However, I question the paper's conclusion that the pointer network approach can handle general types of combinatorial optimization problems. The authors only demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the travelling salesman problem, which has a relatively simple constraint structure.
I suggest that the authors include a discussion on whether the Neural Combinatorial Optimization approach can scale to benchmark problems with complex constraints, such as the capacitated vehicle routing problem or the job shop scheduling problem. Additionally, the authors could use standard benchmark problems like TSPLIB to compare the solver quality of their approach with other state-of-the-art methods.
To answer the three key questions:
1. The specific question/problem tackled by the paper is the application of a pointer network architecture to solve combinatorial optimization problems using reinforcement learning and attention model framework.
2. The approach is well-motivated, as it builds upon existing work in neural-based solutions to combinatorial optimization problems and provides a novel perspective on using sequence-to-sequence approaches.
3. The paper supports its claims with experimental results on the travelling salesman problem, but I believe that more experiments are needed to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach on more complex problems.
My decision is to reject the paper, but with the suggestion that the authors revise and resubmit with additional experiments and discussions on the scalability and effectiveness of their approach on more complex problems.
Additional feedback:
* The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the related work in neural-based solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.
* The authors could provide more insight into the design choices and hyperparameter tuning for the pointer network architecture.
* The experimental results could be improved by including more baseline methods and a more detailed analysis of the results.
Questions for the authors:
* Can you provide more details on how the pointer network architecture is designed and trained for the travelling salesman problem?
* How do you plan to extend the approach to more complex combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints?
* Can you provide more insight into the computational resources and training time required for the approach?
