The paper proposes a novel approach to train stochastic neural networks for probabilistic inference, specifically for drawing samples from given target distributions. The method, called amortized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), iteratively adjusts the neural network parameters to minimize the KL divergence between the target distribution and the network's output. The authors also introduce SteinGAN, an application of this method for generative adversarial training, which achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs).
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in probabilistic inference. Secondly, the paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology, along with empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the SVGD algorithm and its connection to Stein's method, as well as a thorough evaluation of SteinGAN on several benchmark datasets. The results show that SteinGAN can generate realistic-looking images competitive with state-of-the-art GANs.
To further improve the paper, I suggest addressing a few minor errors and suggestions for improvement. For instance, some variables are undefined, and certain phrases could be rephrased for clarity and accuracy. Additionally, the authors may consider providing more discussion on the comparison between constant and per-state value functions, which shows different results in artificial and real-life tasks.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify a few points to help me better understand the paper. Specifically, how do the authors plan to extend the proposed method to more complex distributions, and what are the potential limitations of the approach? Furthermore, can the authors provide more insights into the connection between SteinGAN and other generative adversarial training methods, such as GANs and VAEs?
