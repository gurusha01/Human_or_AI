This paper proposes a method to reduce the inference gap in dropout neural networks by introducing expectation-linear dropout neural networks and a regularization scheme to control the gap. The authors formulate dropout as a latent variable model and define expectation-linearity, which measures the inference gap. They also provide theoretical results to quantify the inference gap and propose a regularization scheme to minimize it.
The paper tackles the specific question of reducing the inference gap in dropout neural networks, which is a well-motivated problem as it can improve the performance of neural networks. The approach is well-placed in the literature, building on previous work on dropout and latent variable models.
The paper supports its claims with theoretical results and empirical evidence. The theoretical results provide a foundation for understanding the inference gap and the proposed regularization scheme. The empirical evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.
However, there are some limitations to the paper. The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with other methods that address the inference gap in dropout neural networks. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis on the trade-off between model accuracy and expectation-linearity.
To improve the paper, the authors could provide more detailed comparisons with other methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and expectation-linearity. They could also consider applying their method to more complex models and tasks, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify their paper are:
* How does the proposed method compare to other methods that address the inference gap in dropout neural networks?
* Can the authors provide more analysis on the trade-off between model accuracy and expectation-linearity?
* How does the proposed method perform on more complex models and tasks, such as natural language processing and computer vision?
Overall, the paper proposes a well-motivated and well-supported method for reducing the inference gap in dropout neural networks. With some additional analysis and comparisons, the paper could be even stronger.
I decide to accept this paper because it proposes a novel and well-supported method for reducing the inference gap in dropout neural networks. The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem, a well-supported theoretical foundation, and empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. While there are some limitations to the paper, they do not outweigh the contributions of the paper. 
Two key reasons for my decision are:
1. The paper proposes a novel and well-supported method for reducing the inference gap in dropout neural networks.
2. The paper provides empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.
Some additional feedback that I would like to provide to the authors is:
* Consider providing more detailed comparisons with other methods that address the inference gap in dropout neural networks.
* Analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and expectation-linearity in more detail.
* Apply the proposed method to more complex models and tasks, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
