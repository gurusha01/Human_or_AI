Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to predict medications taken by a patient based on ICD-9 codes, formulated as a multilabel sequence classification problem. The authors achieve strong results using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, outperforming baselines such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest. The paper addresses a significant problem with potential impact on electronic health records and medication mistakes, and is well-written with clear introduction, motivation, and discussion of related work.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being the strong empirical results and the thorough discussion of the approach. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on a real-world problem, and provide a detailed analysis of the results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's strengths include:
* Strong empirical results: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using RNN models, achieving better results than strong baselines.
* Thorough discussion: The authors provide a detailed analysis of the results, highlighting promising aspects such as kidney code embedding.
* Important problem: The paper addresses a significant problem with potential impact on electronic health records and medication mistakes.
However, the paper also has some weaknesses, including:
* Unintuitive data preprocessing and experimental design choices, such as using truncated patient sequences.
* Lack of novelty in methods: The paper proposes no novel methods, which is a weakness for a methods conference like ICLR.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors:
* Clarify the data preprocessing and experimental design choices, and provide more justification for these decisions.
* Discuss the potential impact of the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications on the results.
* Provide more context on the significance of the gaps between models, and explain the necessary level of performance for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide more details on the data preprocessing and experimental design choices, and justify these decisions?
* How do you plan to address the lack of ground truth labels for missing medications, and what impact do you think this has on the results?
* Can you provide more context on the significance of the gaps between models, and explain the necessary level of performance for the model to be useful in a real clinical setting?
