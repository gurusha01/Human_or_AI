The paper proposes a novel approach to train stochastic neural networks for probabilistic inference, leveraging the concept of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to iteratively adjust the network parameters and minimize the KL divergence with the target distribution. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method, dubbed SteinGAN, in generating realistic-looking images competitive with state-of-the-art results.
I decide to Accept this paper, with the primary reason being that the approach is well-motivated and grounded in the literature, addressing a significant problem in probabilistic inference. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the proposed method, and the empirical results demonstrate its efficacy in various applications.
The key strengths of the paper include the innovative application of SVGD to train neural samplers, the amortized MLE approach for generative adversarial training, and the impressive empirical results on multiple datasets. The authors also provide a thorough discussion of related work and the theoretical foundations of their method.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the encoding method used, as the current description is unclear and misleading. Additionally, incorporating results of pruning combined with the proposed method would allow for a more comprehensive comparison with existing approaches, such as Han et al.
Some questions I would like the authors to address include: (1) How does the choice of kernel in SVGD affect the performance of SteinGAN? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the relationship between the Stein variational gradient and the typical gradient ascent for maximizing log p(x)? (3) How does the proposed method handle cases where the target distribution is multimodal or has a complex structure?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of probabilistic inference and generative modeling, and with some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a highly impactful publication.
