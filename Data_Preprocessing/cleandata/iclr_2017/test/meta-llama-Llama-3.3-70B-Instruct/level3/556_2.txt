Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper presents a novel approach for learning state representations in multi-task reinforcement learning, called Multi-Task Learning with Robotic Priors (MT-LRP). The method learns multiple low-dimensional state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised fashion, without any knowledge of which task is executed or the number of tasks involved. The authors claim that MT-LRP is able to learn better state representations for reinforcement learning and provide experimental results to support this claim.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper is unclear and overuses the term "local minimia" without sufficient evidence to support their claims. Secondly, the authors fail to acknowledge that slices of a non-convex problem can resemble the ones they present, potentially misleading the reader.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of clarity and overuse of technical terms makes it difficult to understand the authors' claims and contributions. Furthermore, the authors' failure to acknowledge the potential limitations of their approach and the possibility of alternative explanations for their results undermines the validity of their conclusions. Additionally, the paper's superficial analysis of the results, such as the observation on incremental improvement of optimization methods decreasing rapidly, lacks depth and insight.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of their approach and results, and acknowledge potential limitations and alternative explanations. Additionally, the authors could provide more rigorous analysis and evaluation of their method, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations and illustrations to support the authors' claims and make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more detailed explanations of the robotic priors and how they are used in the MT-LRP approach?
2. How do you address the potential issue of local minimia in the optimization process, and what evidence do you have to support your claims?
3. Can you provide more rigorous analysis and evaluation of the MT-LRP approach, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods?
4. How do you plan to address the potential limitations and alternative explanations for your results, and what future work do you propose to further validate your approach?
