Step 1: Summarize what the paper claims to do/contribute
The paper proposes an actor-critic algorithm to automatically learn the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms. The algorithm uses a policy network (actor) to determine the learning rate and a value network (critic) to evaluate the goodness of the learning rate. The paper claims that this approach can lead to better convergence and prevent overfitting, resulting in improved performance compared to human-designed learning rate schedules.
Step 2: Clearly state the decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice
I decide to reject this paper. The two key reasons for this decision are: (1) the paper's evaluation results are not convincing due to the small dataset size and limited comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, and (2) the paper's assumption of aligning detected entities to relations and taking conjunctions may not always be correct and needs justification on real QA datasets.
Step 3: Provide supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision
The paper's experiments are conducted on two image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), which may not be representative of more complex tasks. Additionally, the comparison with other methods is limited, and the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the results. Furthermore, the paper's assumption about aligning detected entities to relations and taking conjunctions may not always hold true, and the paper does not provide sufficient justification or evaluation on real QA datasets.
Step 4: Provide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper
To improve the paper, the authors could consider evaluating their approach on more diverse and complex datasets, such as natural language processing or computer vision tasks. They could also provide a more thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and analyze the results in more detail. Additionally, the authors could consider justifying their assumption about aligning detected entities to relations and taking conjunctions on real QA datasets.
Step 5: Ask questions to clarify the understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence
I would like to ask the authors to clarify how they plan to extend their approach to more complex tasks and datasets. How do they plan to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach in these scenarios? What additional evidence or analysis can they provide to support their claims about the benefits of their approach? How do they plan to address the potential limitations and assumptions of their approach, such as the alignment of detected entities to relations and taking conjunctions?
