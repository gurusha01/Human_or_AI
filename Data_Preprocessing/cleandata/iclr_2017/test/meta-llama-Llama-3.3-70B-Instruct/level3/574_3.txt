Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for the identification of rare and small events. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice:
1. Disorganization and lack of clarity: The manuscript is difficult to follow, and the authors fail to clearly explain the shortcomings of existing methods and how RFNs overcome them. The writing is also marred by numerous grammatical errors, which detract from the overall quality of the paper.
2. Insufficient comparison to state-of-the-art methods: Although the authors compare RFNs to 13 other biclustering methods, the explanation of how RFNs relate to existing state-of-the-art methods is unclear. The authors need to provide a more detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of RFNs compared to other methods.
Supporting Arguments
To support my decision, I argue that the paper's disorganization and lack of clarity make it challenging to understand the authors' contributions and the significance of their results. Furthermore, the insufficient comparison to state-of-the-art methods raises concerns about the paper's scientific rigor and the validity of the authors' claims.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
* Reorganize the manuscript to clearly explain the shortcomings of existing methods and how RFNs overcome them.
* Provide a more detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of RFNs compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
* Address the grammatical errors and improve the overall writing quality.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
* Can you provide a more detailed explanation of how RFNs overcome the limitations of FABIA, particularly in terms of computational complexity and decorrelation of code units?
* How do RFNs compare to other state-of-the-art biclustering methods, such as non-negative matrix factorization and spectral biclustering?
* Can you provide more information about the experimental setup and the parameters used for the RFN model, particularly in the context of the 1000 Genomes Project data?
