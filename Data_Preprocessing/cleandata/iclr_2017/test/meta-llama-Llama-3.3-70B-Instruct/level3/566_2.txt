This paper proposes a framework to incorporate active learning into deep learning, addressing scalability challenges in training deep neural networks. The authors introduce a novel active learning training framework by formulating the problem as a Bayesian inference problem and approximating the Fisher Information matrix to reduce computational burden. 
I decide to reject this paper for the following reasons: 
1. The paper lacks polish due to numerous grammatical and typing errors, which makes it difficult to follow and understand the content.
2. The paper needs improvement in clarity, particularly in explaining motivations and tying them to the methodology, as well as making the related work section more relevant and concise.
To support my decision, I provide the following arguments:
- The paper's lack of polish and clarity hinders its overall quality and readability.
- The authors' failure to provide a clear and concise explanation of their methodology and its relation to existing work makes it challenging to evaluate the paper's contributions.
To improve the paper, I suggest the following:
- The authors should thoroughly proofread the paper to eliminate grammatical and typing errors.
- The authors should reorganize the paper to improve clarity, focusing on explaining the motivations and methodology in a more concise and relevant manner.
- The authors should provide more detailed explanations of their framework and its advantages over existing methods.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims:
- Can you provide more details on how your framework addresses the scalability challenges in training deep neural networks?
- How does your framework differ from existing active learning methods, and what are its advantages?
- Can you provide more experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of your framework in various scenarios?
