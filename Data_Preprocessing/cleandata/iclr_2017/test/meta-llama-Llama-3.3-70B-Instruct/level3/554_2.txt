Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) with eligibility traces, specifically DRQN with eligibility traces, to improve training in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms. The algorithm, based on the actor-critic framework, learns to adjust the learning rate at each step during training, leveraging long-term rewards to choose a better learning rate. The paper presents a well-written and effectively covered related literature, with experiments conducted on two image classification datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the algorithm is evaluated on only two problems with a single set of hyper-parameters, which may not be sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of its performance. Secondly, the topic of adding eligibility traces to RL updates is interesting but not novel, and the paper lacks a wider range of experiments to strengthen its findings.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's evaluation is limited to two datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, which may not be representative of the broader range of problems that the algorithm could be applied to. Additionally, the use of a single set of hyper-parameters may not capture the full potential of the algorithm, and the lack of comparison with other state-of-the-art methods makes it difficult to assess the algorithm's relative performance. While the paper presents some promising results, the limited scope of the evaluation and the lack of novelty in the topic of eligibility traces in RL updates are significant concerns.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I would suggest conducting additional experiments on a wider range of datasets and problems, using multiple sets of hyper-parameters, and comparing the algorithm's performance to other state-of-the-art methods. I would also like to see a more detailed analysis of the algorithm's behavior and the impact of the eligibility traces on the learning process. Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the eligibility traces affect the algorithm's convergence rate and stability? Can the algorithm be applied to other variants of SGD methods? How does the algorithm's performance compare to other adaptive learning rate methods, such as vSGD? What are the potential limitations and challenges of applying this algorithm to more complex problems or larger datasets?
