This paper introduces a mechanism for active learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a greedy selection scheme based on variational free energy and approximations. The authors propose a novel approach to active learning, which is a significant contribution to the field. 
I decide to reject this paper for the following reasons: 
Firstly, the paper is difficult to read due to grammatical errors and sloppy notation, which should be fixed for the final version, preferably by a native speaker. 
Secondly, the paper succeeds in showing a proof of concept for active learning in CNNs, but only on toy datasets, and raises questions about the inconsistency of results on different datasets, such as USPS and MNIST. 
Thirdly, I question the necessity of sampling a larger subset before selecting using active learning, and whether it improves results or is done for computational efficiency. 
Lastly, the paper's code is not available, and I request it to understand the complex approximations used. 
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors address the above concerns, provide clearer notation and grammar, and include more experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. 
I have several questions for the authors: 
1. Can you provide more details on the greedy selection scheme used in the paper? 
2. How do you plan to address the inconsistency of results on different datasets? 
3. Can you provide more insights into the computational efficiency of the proposed approach? 
4. Will you make the code available for further research and experimentation? 
Overall, while the paper presents an interesting approach to active learning, it requires significant improvements in terms of clarity, experimentation, and code availability.
