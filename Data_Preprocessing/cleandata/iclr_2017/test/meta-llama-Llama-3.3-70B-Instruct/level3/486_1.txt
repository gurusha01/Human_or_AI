Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model. The GCN model uses an efficient layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several network datasets, outperforming recent related methods by a significant margin while being computationally efficient.
