Summary
The paper proposes a Chaos-Free Network (CFN), a simple gated recurrent neural network that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. The CFN has a two-stream architecture and uses a statistical distribution to match the intermediate representation. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the CFN's dynamics, showing that it is never chaotic and has a predictable behavior.
Decision
I decide to reject the paper, with the main reason being that the approach lacks clear motivation and justification for the proposed architecture. While the paper provides an interesting analysis of the CFN's dynamics, it does not convincingly demonstrate the benefits of using a chaos-free network over traditional recurrent neural networks.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's experimental results on the Penn Treebank corpus and the Text8 corpus show that the CFN achieves performance comparable to LSTMs and GRUs. However, the paper does not provide a clear explanation for why the CFN's simple dynamics are beneficial for language modeling tasks. Additionally, the paper's analysis of the CFN's dynamics, while interesting, does not provide a clear connection to the network's performance on language modeling tasks.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for the proposed architecture and demonstrate the benefits of using a chaos-free network over traditional recurrent neural networks. The authors should also provide more extensive experiments on large-scale datasets and tasks to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the CFN. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the necessity of Equation 2 and the choice of batch size, and provide a more detailed analysis of the CFN's dynamics in the presence of input data.
Questions
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can the authors provide a clearer explanation for why the CFN's simple dynamics are beneficial for language modeling tasks?
2. How do the authors plan to extend the CFN to more complex tasks that require longer-term dependencies?
3. Can the authors provide more details on the experimental setup, including the choice of hyperparameters and the training procedure?
