Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called Doubly Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs), specifically designed for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture models the information flow in a tree using two separate recurrent modules: one for ancestral information (from parent to children) and one for fraternal information (from sibling to sibling). The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DRNNs in recovering latent tree structures from flattened string representations, mapping sentences to functional programs, and exhibiting desirable properties in machine translation tasks.
Decision and Reasons
Based on the evaluation, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. Novelty and significance of the proposed architecture: The paper introduces a new and innovative approach to modeling tree-structured data, which has the potential to improve performance in various natural language processing tasks.
2. Strong experimental results: The authors provide convincing experimental results on multiple tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of DRNNs in recovering tree structures, generating programs, and exhibiting desirable properties in machine translation.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The authors thoroughly discuss the limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel architecture that addresses these limitations. The experimental results are comprehensive and well-presented, demonstrating the strengths of DRNNs in various tasks.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I would like to see more analysis on the following aspects:
* How do the hyperparameters of the DRNN architecture affect its performance?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and the information flow in the tree?
* How does the DRNN architecture compare to other state-of-the-art models in terms of computational efficiency and scalability?
I would also like to ask the authors to clarify the following points:
* Can you provide more details on the dataset used for the machine translation task and the preprocessing steps applied to the data?
* How do you handle out-of-vocabulary tokens in the DRNN architecture?
* Are there any plans to apply the DRNN architecture to other domains or tasks, such as computer vision or speech recognition?
