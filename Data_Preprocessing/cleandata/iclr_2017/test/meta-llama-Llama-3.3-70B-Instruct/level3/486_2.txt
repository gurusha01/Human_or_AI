Summary of the Paper's Claims and Contributions
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning method for graphs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation, which demonstrates good scalability and performance on large datasets. The algorithm is technically sound and simple, with easy training, although its originality is limited as it adapts existing graph convolutional networks to a semi-supervised setting. The authors claim that their model can encode both graph structure and node features in a way that is useful for semi-supervised classification, outperforming several recently proposed methods by a significant margin while being computationally efficient.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the provided guidelines, I decide to Accept this paper with some reservations. The key reasons for this decision are:
1. The paper tackles a specific question/problem in the field of graph-based semi-supervised learning, which is well-motivated and well-placed in the literature.
2. The approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their methodology and its relation to existing work.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a thorough explanation of the proposed method, including its theoretical motivation and experimental evaluation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several datasets, including citation networks and a knowledge graph dataset. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods, including label propagation, semi-supervised embedding, and manifold regularization.
However, I have some concerns regarding the paper's limitations, such as the lack of comparison with iterative classifiers and the decision to limit the architecture to one hidden layer. Additionally, the paper could benefit from highlighting the differences and novelty of the proposed algorithm compared to existing reference papers, such as Defferrard 2016.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors:
1. Provide a more detailed comparison with iterative classifiers, such as the iterative classification algorithm (ICA), to demonstrate the advantages of their approach.
2. Explore the use of more layers for graph classification to investigate the potential benefits of deeper architectures.
3. Clarify the relation between their proposed method and existing work, such as Defferrard 2016, to highlight the novelty and contributions of their approach.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
1. How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in their model, particularly when dealing with large graphs and limited labeled data?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of hidden units and the dropout rate, and how they affect the performance of the model?
3. How do the authors envision their approach being applied to real-world problems, such as node classification in large social networks or knowledge graphs?
