Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes an innovative approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms using an actor-critic framework from reinforcement learning (RL). The actor network learns to predict the learning rate at each time step, while the critic network provides feedback on the long-term performance of the chosen learning rate. This approach allows for more adaptive and efficient learning rate control, potentially leading to better convergence and generalization performance.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons: 
1. The paper lacks convincing evidence to justify the use of the proposed actor-critic algorithm over traditional learning rate scheduling methods.
2. The experimental results, although promising, are not comprehensive enough to fully demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
While the idea of using RL to learn learning rates is intriguing, the paper falls short in providing sufficient empirical evidence to support its claims. The experiments are limited to two image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), and the comparison to other adaptive learning rate methods is not exhaustive. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from more ablation studies to separate the influence of different components of the proposed algorithm, such as the actor and critic networks.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors conduct more extensive experiments on various datasets and compare their approach to a wider range of learning rate scheduling methods. Additionally, providing more insights into the learned learning rate schedules and analyzing the behavior of the actor and critic networks could help to better understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. How do the learned learning rate schedules compare to traditional scheduling methods, such as exponential decay or cosine annealing?
2. Can the authors provide more insights into the behavior of the actor and critic networks during training, such as visualizations of the learned learning rate schedules or analysis of the critic network's feedback signals?
3. How do the authors plan to extend their approach to other variants of SGD methods, such as Adam or RMSprop, and what are the potential challenges and benefits of doing so?
