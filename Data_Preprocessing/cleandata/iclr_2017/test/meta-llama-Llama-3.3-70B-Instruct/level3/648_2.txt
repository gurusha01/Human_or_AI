Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. The authors introduce a context-conditional generative adversarial network (CC-GAN) that learns to fill in missing patches in an image, and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and fake in-paintings. The CC-GAN is combined with a classification objective to provide a unified framework for semi-supervised learning. The authors evaluate their approach on STL-10 and PASCAL datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.
Decision
I decide to accept this paper, with the main reason being that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two classification benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. However, I have some concerns about the novelty of the core idea and the comparison between CC-GAN and SSL-GAN.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents a well-motivated approach that builds on existing work in generative adversarial networks and semi-supervised learning. The authors provide a clear explanation of their method and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on two datasets. The results show that the CC-GAN approach outperforms existing methods, including the SSL-GAN baseline. However, I am concerned that the core idea of using GAN discriminative features for semi-supervised learning is not very novel, as it has been established in previous works.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more discussion on the novelty of their approach and how it differs from existing work. Additionally, I would like to see more analysis on the comparison between CC-GAN and SSL-GAN, as the CC-GAN2 model seems like a hacky way to improve upon the core CC-GAN idea. I would also appreciate more details on the training procedures and hyperparameter settings used in the experiments.
Questions for the Authors
Can you provide more discussion on the novelty of your approach and how it differs from existing work in semi-supervised learning? How do you respond to the criticism that the core idea of using GAN discriminative features for semi-supervised learning is not very novel? Can you provide more analysis on the comparison between CC-GAN and SSL-GAN, and explain why the CC-GAN2 model is necessary? How do you plan to address the issue of scaling the approach to larger image sizes, as mentioned in the discussion section?
