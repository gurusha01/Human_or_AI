Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model. The GCN model uses an efficient layer-wise propagation rule based on a first-order approximation of spectral convolutions on graphs. The authors demonstrate that their model outperforms several recently proposed methods by a significant margin, while being computationally efficient.
Decision to Accept
I decide to accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper proposes a novel and well-motivated approach for semi-supervised classification on graph-structured data, and (2) the empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on several benchmark datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed GCN model, including its motivation, architecture, and training procedure. The authors also provide a thorough analysis of the model's behavior and performance on several benchmark datasets, including citation networks and a knowledge graph dataset. The results demonstrate that the GCN model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, including label propagation, semi-supervised embedding, and manifold regularization.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the model's performance on larger and more complex graph datasets. Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of their GCN model to other tasks, such as graph classification and link prediction.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of the GCN model and how it compares to other state-of-the-art methods?
2. How do you handle cases where the graph structure is very sparse or very dense?
3. Can you provide more insights on the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, hidden units, and dropout rate?
Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of graph-based semi-supervised learning and deserves to be accepted.
