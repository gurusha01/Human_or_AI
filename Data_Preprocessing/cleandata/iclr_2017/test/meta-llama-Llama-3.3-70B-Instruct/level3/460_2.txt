This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture, called doubly recurrent neural networks (DRNNs), for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture combines two separate recurrent modules, one for ancestral information and one for fraternal information, to model the flow of information in a tree. The topology of the tree is modeled explicitly and separately from the label prediction, allowing for more flexible and accurate tree generation.
The paper claims to contribute to the field of deep learning by introducing a new architecture that can effectively generate tree-structured data, which is essential in many applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and program synthesis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through several experiments, including synthetic tree recovery, mapping sentences to functional programs, and machine translation.
Based on the provided key points, I decide to Reject this paper with two key reasons:
1. The paper lacks technical clarifications on certain aspects, such as the computation of $Q^{ret}$, the derivation of eq. (7), and the use of $Q^{ret}$ in eq. (8). These unclear points make it difficult to fully understand the proposed method and its implementation.
2. The experimental setup, including the size of the replay memory, may have a significant impact on the performance of the models and needs to be reassessed. The paper's evaluation is limited to domains where sample efficiency is not important, making it unclear if the method will generalize to other problems.
To improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more technical details and clarifications on the proposed method, as well as conduct more comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of their approach. Additionally, the authors may consider addressing the following questions:
* How does the proposed method handle out-of-vocabulary tokens or unseen tree structures?
* Can the authors provide more insights into the learned representations and the decision-making process of the DRNNs?
* How does the performance of the DRNNs compare to other state-of-the-art methods in the field?
By addressing these questions and providing more technical clarifications, the authors can strengthen their paper and demonstrate the potential of their proposed method in generating tree-structured data.
