Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for the identification of rare and small events. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with the main reason being the significant improvement in biclustering performance over existing methods, including FABIA, on various datasets. The second reason is the potential of RFNs to become the new state-of-the-art biclustering algorithm, given its ability to handle large datasets, sparse coding, and distinct membership assignment.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-motivated introduction to the problem of biclustering and the limitations of existing methods. The authors propose a novel approach using RFNs, which is well-placed in the literature and supported by theoretical and empirical results. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various datasets, including synthetic and real-world data. The results show that RFNs outperform existing methods, including FABIA, in terms of biclustering performance.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest exploring practical use cases, such as hierarchical forecasting for electricity or sales, which could be an interesting application of RFNs. Additionally, the authors could provide more details on the computational complexity of RFNs and compare it to existing methods. It would also be helpful to include more visualizations of the biclustering results to facilitate understanding.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the training process of the RFN model, including the optimization algorithm used and the convergence criteria?
2. How do you select the hyperparameters for the RFN model, such as the number of hidden units, dropout rate, and learning rate?
3. Can you provide more insights into the interpretation of the biclustering results, particularly in the context of the 1000 Genomes Project data?
