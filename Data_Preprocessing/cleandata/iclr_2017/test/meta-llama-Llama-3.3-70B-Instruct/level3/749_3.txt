Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for visualizing the importance of specific inputs in determining the output of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The authors introduce a framework for decomposing the output of an LSTM into a product of factors, where each term can be interpreted as the contribution of a particular word. They then use this framework to extract phrases that consistently provide large contributions to the prediction of a particular class. The extracted phrases are validated through their performance in a simple, rules-based classifier.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper's approach, although well-motivated, lacks a clear connection to existing concepts in deep learning, such as regularization. Secondly, the experimental results, while promising, are not comprehensive enough to fully support the claims made by the authors.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's attempt to identify design patterns for deep architectures is commendable, but the choice of 14 design patterns is unclear, and some patterns are too vague or poorly named. The extensions proposed in Section 4 seem disconnected from the rest of the paper, and the relationships between the proposed design patterns and their practical applications are unclear. Additionally, the paper's language is sometimes cryptic, making it difficult to understand the connections between the design patterns and previous works.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a table mapping design patterns to specific deep networks, which would help clarify the relationships between the patterns and their applications. Furthermore, the authors should consider providing more explanation and concrete connections to existing concepts in deep learning. The paper would also benefit from more comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence for my assessment, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more insight into the choice of 14 design patterns and how they were selected?
2. How do the proposed design patterns relate to existing concepts in deep learning, such as regularization?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive experimental results, including comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods?
