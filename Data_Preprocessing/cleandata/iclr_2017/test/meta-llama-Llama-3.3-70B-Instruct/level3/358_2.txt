Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for the identification of rare and small events. The method is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data, demonstrating its superiority over 13 other biclustering methods.
Decision and Key Reasons
I decide to Accept this paper, with the key reasons being:
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and conceptually simple approach to biclustering, which is a significant addition to the literature on this topic.
2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs in identifying biclusters, outperforming other methods on various datasets.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and well-structured presentation of the RFN approach, including its mathematical formulation and implementation details. The experimental evaluation is thorough, covering a range of datasets and comparison methods. The results show that RFNs can identify biclusters with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and overlapping clusters.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions
To further improve the paper, I suggest:
* Providing more details on the computational complexity of RFNs and their scalability to large datasets.
* Investigating the robustness of RFNs to different types of noise and outliers in the data.
* Considering the application of RFNs to other domains, such as image or text analysis.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into the choice of hyperparameters for RFNs, such as the number of hidden units and the dropout rate?
* How do RFNs handle cases where the number of biclusters is unknown or varies across different datasets?
* Are there any plans to release the RFN implementation as open-source software, to facilitate further research and replication of the results?
