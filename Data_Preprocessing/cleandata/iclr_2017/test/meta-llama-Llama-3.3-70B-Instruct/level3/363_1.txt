Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes a novel approach for visualizing the importance of specific inputs in determining the output of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. By decomposing the output of an LSTM into a product of factors, the authors are able to assign importance scores to individual words, which can be used to extract representative phrases that capture the underlying patterns learned by the LSTM. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis and question answering.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to visualizing the importance of inputs in LSTMs. The paper provides a clear and concise explanation of the methodology, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in extracting meaningful phrases that capture the underlying patterns learned by the LSTM.
Supporting Arguments
The paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of natural language processing, namely, understanding how LSTMs make predictions. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing work in the field, and the authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the methodology. The experimental results are thorough and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in extracting meaningful phrases that capture the underlying patterns learned by the LSTM.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more qualitative analysis of the extracted phrases, including examples of how they can be used to improve the interpretability of LSTMs. Additionally, the authors may want to consider exploring the application of their approach to other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling or machine translation.
Questions for the Authors
1. Can you provide more examples of how the extracted phrases can be used to improve the interpretability of LSTMs, such as identifying biases or errors in the model?
2. How do you plan to extend your approach to other natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling or machine translation?
3. Can you provide more details on the computational resources required to implement your approach, and how it can be scaled to larger datasets and models?
