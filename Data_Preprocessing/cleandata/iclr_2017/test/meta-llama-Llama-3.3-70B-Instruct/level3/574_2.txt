Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to biclustering using Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), which overcomes the limitations of existing methods, particularly FABIA. RFNs efficiently construct sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input data, allowing for the identification of rare and small events. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RFNs on various synthetic and real-world datasets, including gene expression data and the 1000 Genomes Project data.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in biclustering, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by extensive experiments.
Supporting Arguments
The paper clearly addresses the shortcomings of FABIA, a widely used biclustering method, and proposes a novel solution using RFNs. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of RFNs on various datasets, demonstrating their superiority over other biclustering methods. The use of RFNs allows for fast computations on GPUs, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. The paper also provides a clear and concise explanation of the RFN model and its application to biclustering.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for RFNs, as well as a more in-depth analysis of the results on the 1000 Genomes Project data. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more visualizations of the biclustering results to facilitate understanding.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
1. Can you provide more details on the computational complexity of RFNs compared to FABIA?
2. How did you select the hyperparameters for RFNs, and what was the effect of varying these parameters on the results?
3. Can you provide more insight into the biological significance of the IBD segments identified in the 1000 Genomes Project data?
