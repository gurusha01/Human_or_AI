Summary
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach based on in-painting with an adversarial loss, called Context-Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CC-GANs). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two classification benchmarks, STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007, and show that it outperforms existing semi-supervised methods. The CC-GAN model consists of a generator that fills in missing patches in an image and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and generated images.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper does not clearly motivate the use of CC-GANs over other semi-supervised learning approaches, and the differences between CC-GANs and previous methods, such as the context-encoder approach, are not well-explained. Secondly, the experimental comparisons made in the paper are not entirely fair, as the CC-GAN model uses a larger architecture (VGG-A') than some of the baseline models, which may contribute to its improved performance.
Supporting Arguments
The paper presents some promising results on the STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets, but the lack of clear motivation and fair comparisons makes it difficult to fully assess the contribution of the CC-GAN approach. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more analysis of the learned representations and the in-painting results, to provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of the approach.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison with previous semi-supervised learning approaches, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Additionally, the authors could consider using a more rigorous evaluation protocol, such as using multiple runs with different random seeds, to ensure the reliability of the results. Finally, the authors could provide more visualizations and analysis of the in-painting results, to give a better understanding of the quality and diversity of the generated images.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
* Can you provide more details on the differences between CC-GANs and previous semi-supervised learning approaches, such as the context-encoder approach?
* How do you ensure that the CC-GAN model is not simply memorizing the training data, rather than learning a generalizable representation?
* Can you provide more analysis of the learned representations and the in-painting results, to give a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of the approach?
