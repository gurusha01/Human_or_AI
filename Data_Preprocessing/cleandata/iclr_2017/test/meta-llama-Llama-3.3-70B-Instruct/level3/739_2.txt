The paper proposes a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data using a variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs. The authors introduce a simple and well-behaved layer-wise propagation rule for neural network models that can be motivated from a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. The model is shown to outperform recent related methods by a significant margin on several network datasets, while being computationally efficient.
However, I decide to reject this paper for the following reasons: 
Firstly, the proposed algorithm for polynomial feature expansion on CSR matrices reduces time complexity, but its significance and contribution are not substantial enough. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the proposed algorithm improves upon existing methods, and the experimental results do not demonstrate a significant advantage over other approaches.
Secondly, the background introduction is insufficient, with too few references, particularly outdated ones, and lacks citation of recent relevant literature. The paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in graph-based semi-supervised learning, and the authors do not adequately situate their work within the broader context of the field.
Lastly, the experiment section is weak, with unconvincing results and a lack of fair comparison between the proposed method and the standard method. The paper only compares the proposed method with a few baseline methods, and the results are not consistent across all datasets. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results, making it difficult to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed method.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive background introduction, including a thorough review of recent relevant literature. The authors should also provide a clearer explanation of the proposed algorithm and its significance, as well as more convincing experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should address the minor issues in the paper, such as unclear notation, typos, and missing details in experimental settings and figure descriptions.
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence to support their claims: 
1. Can the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the proposed algorithm and its significance, including a comparison with existing methods?
2. How do the authors plan to address the limitations of their approach, such as the assumption that edges encode mere similarity of nodes?
3. Can the authors provide more convincing experimental results, including a comparison with a wider range of baseline methods and a more detailed analysis of the results?
