Step 1: Summarize what the paper claims to do/contribute
The paper proposes an actor-critic algorithm to automatically learn the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms. The algorithm uses a policy network (actor) to determine the learning rate at each step and a value network (critic) to estimate the long-term performance of the chosen learning rate. The paper claims that this approach can lead to better convergence and prevent overfitting, resulting in improved performance compared to human-designed learning rate schedules.
Step 2: Clearly state the decision (accept or reject) with one or two key reasons for this choice
I decide to accept this paper with the key reason being that the proposed algorithm shows promising results in experiments on two image classification datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), achieving comparable convergence speed to expert-designed optimizers while obtaining better test accuracy. Additionally, the paper provides a clear and well-motivated approach to learning rate control using reinforcement learning techniques.
Step 3: Provide supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision
The paper provides a thorough analysis of the problem of learning rate control and motivates the use of reinforcement learning techniques to address this issue. The proposed algorithm is well-designed, and the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The paper also provides a clear comparison with other adaptive learning rate methods, showing that the proposed approach performs better than existing methods.
Step 4: Provide additional feedback with the aim to improve the paper
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed analysis of the learned learning rate schedules and how they compare to human-designed schedules. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on different datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. The authors may also consider providing more discussion on the potential applications of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios.
Step 5: Ask questions to clarify understanding of the paper and provide additional evidence
I would like to ask the authors to clarify how the state function χ(·) is designed and what kind of information it captures about the current model and training data. Additionally, I would like to see more experiments on the effect of feeding different examples to the actor and critic networks, as this seems to be an important aspect of the proposed algorithm. How do the authors plan to extend this work to other variants of SGD methods and to learn individual learning rates for each parameter?
