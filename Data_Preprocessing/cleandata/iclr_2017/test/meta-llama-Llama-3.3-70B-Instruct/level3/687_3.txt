Summary
The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for images based on in-painting using an adversarial loss. The authors introduce a context-conditional generative adversarial network (CC-GAN) that learns to fill in missing patches in images, and use the discriminator to learn features for classification tasks. The approach is evaluated on STL-10 and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets, and achieves comparable or superior performance to existing methods.
Decision
I decide to reject this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper lacks focus and does not have a concrete conclusion, making it unclear what the paper's main contribution is. Secondly, the introduction of a new second-order method is not well-motivated, and the paper's minor conclusions about representations may be based on side-effects of the greedy serial pruning method.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's lack of focus is evident in its disjointed conclusion section, which fails to provide a clear summary of the paper's findings. Additionally, the title and abstract of the paper suggest that it is about learnt representations, but the content does not support this claim. The introduction of a new second-order method is not well-motivated, and the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its effectiveness. Furthermore, the paper's experiments are not comprehensive, and the results are not rigorously analyzed.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors focus on a specific aspect, such as comparing pruning methods or learning about representations, and streamline the content to boost its impact. The authors should also provide more motivation for the introduction of the new second-order method and provide more comprehensive experiments to support their claims. Additionally, the authors should clarify the relationship between the CC-GAN and other existing methods, and provide more analysis of the results.
Questions for the Authors
I would like the authors to answer the following questions to clarify my understanding of the paper:
1. Can you provide more motivation for the introduction of the new second-order method, and explain how it differs from existing methods?
2. How do you respond to the criticism that the paper lacks focus and does not have a concrete conclusion?
3. Can you provide more comprehensive experiments to support the effectiveness of the CC-GAN, and clarify the relationship between the CC-GAN and other existing methods?
