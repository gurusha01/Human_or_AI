The paper "Neural Combinatorial Optimization" presents a novel framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. The authors focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and propose a pointer network architecture that learns to predict a distribution over different city permutations. The network is trained using a policy gradient method with a reward signal based on the negative tour length.
The paper claims to achieve close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes, outperforming supervised learning approaches and competing with state-of-the-art solvers. The authors also demonstrate the flexibility of their method by applying it to the Knapsack problem, achieving optimal solutions for instances with up to 200 items.
