Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a set of design patterns for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, aiming to provide guidance for both experienced and novice practitioners. The authors review recent literature on deep learning and extract commonalities to define 14 design patterns, including "Architectural Structure follows the Application", "Proliferate Paths", and "Strive for Simplicity". They also introduce novel architectures, such as Fractal of FractalNet, Stagewise Boosting Networks, and Taylor Series Networks, and provide experimental results to validate their design patterns.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper, with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and important problem in the deep learning community, namely providing guidance for designing CNN architectures, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and grounded in a thorough review of recent literature.
Supporting Arguments
The paper demonstrates a clear understanding of the current state of deep learning research and identifies a significant gap in the literature, namely the lack of guidance for designing CNN architectures. The authors' approach to defining design patterns is well-motivated, drawing on established concepts from architecture and software design. The experimental results provide some evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed design patterns, although more comprehensive evaluation is needed.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors provide more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between different design patterns and more extensive experimental results to validate their claims. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more discussion on the potential applications and limitations of the proposed design patterns. Some questions I would like the authors to address include: (1) How do the proposed design patterns relate to other existing architectures, such as Residual Networks and Inception? (2) Can the design patterns be applied to other types of neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks or Deep Reinforcement Learning architectures? (3) How can the proposed design patterns be used to improve the interpretability and explainability of CNN models?
