Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper proposes an innovative approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based machine learning algorithms using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). The authors design an algorithm that trains a policy network (actor) to decide the learning rate at each step during training and a value network (critic) to provide feedback about the quality of the decision. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads to good convergence of SGD, prevents overfitting to a certain extent, and results in better performance than human-designed competitors.
Decision and Key Reasons
Based on the review, I decide to Accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are:
1. The approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature, addressing a significant problem in machine learning, which is the sensitivity of SGD to learning rates.
2. The paper provides empirical evidence and theoretical justification for the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in various experiments and comparing it to other state-of-the-art methods.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, explaining the importance of learning rates in SGD and the limitations of existing methods. The authors also provide a thorough review of related work, highlighting the contributions of their approach. The proposed algorithm is well-designed, and the experiments are carefully conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than human-designed competitors and prevent overfitting to a certain extent.
Additional Feedback and Questions
To further improve the paper, I suggest the authors consider the following:
* Provide more details about the implementation of the actor and critic networks, such as the architecture and hyperparameters used.
* Discuss the potential limitations of the proposed approach and possible extensions to other optimization algorithms.
* Consider adding more experiments to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method to different datasets and models.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper are:
* How did the authors choose the specific architecture and hyperparameters for the actor and critic networks?
* Can the proposed approach be extended to other optimization algorithms, such as Adam or RMSprop?
* How does the proposed method handle cases where the learning rate needs to be adjusted rapidly, such as in online learning scenarios?
