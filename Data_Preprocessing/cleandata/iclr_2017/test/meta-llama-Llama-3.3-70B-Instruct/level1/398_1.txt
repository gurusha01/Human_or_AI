Summary
The paper introduces a simple gated recurrent neural network (RNN) called Chaos-Free Network (CFN) that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. The authors prove that the CFN has simple, predictable, and non-chaotic dynamics, in contrast to more standard gated architectures, which can exhibit chaotic behavior.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with two key reasons: (1) the paper tackles a specific and interesting question about the dynamics of RNNs, and (2) the approach is well-motivated and supported by theoretical and empirical results.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem of chaos in RNNs and motivates the need for a simple and interpretable model. The authors propose a simple gated RNN architecture, CFN, and provide a theoretical analysis of its dynamics, showing that it is non-chaotic and has a simple attractor. The paper also presents empirical results on the word-level language modeling task, demonstrating that the CFN achieves performance comparable to LSTMs and GRUs.
Additional Feedback
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more detailed comparisons with other RNN architectures, such as vanilla RNNs and GRUs, in terms of their dynamics and performance. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more experiments on other tasks, such as character-level language modeling or machine translation, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the CFN.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like to ask the authors the following questions:
1. Can you provide more intuition on why the CFN is able to achieve comparable performance to LSTMs and GRUs despite its simple dynamics?
2. How do you plan to extend the CFN to capture longer-term dependencies, and what are the potential limitations of the current architecture?
3. Can you provide more details on the initialization scheme used for the CFN and LSTMs, and how it affects the performance of the models?
