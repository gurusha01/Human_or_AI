The paper claims to contribute to the field of medical informatics by developing a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict the therapeutic classes of medications that a patient is likely to be taking, given a sequence of billing codes in their electronic medical record. The authors propose using RNNs to capture the sequential nature of clinical data and evaluate the performance of their model against several baselines, including a feed-forward neural network and a random forest.
Based on the results presented, I decide to accept this paper. The two key reasons for this choice are: (1) the paper tackles a significant problem in medical informatics, namely the accuracy of medication lists in electronic medical records, and (2) the authors propose a novel approach using RNNs, which shows promising results compared to baseline models.
The paper provides a clear motivation for the problem, including a thorough review of the literature on the limitations of current methods for maintaining accurate medication lists. The authors also provide a detailed description of their methodology, including the architecture of their RNN model and the evaluation metrics used to assess its performance. The results show that the RNN model outperforms the baseline models, with a micro-averaged AUC of 0.93 and a label ranking loss of 0.076.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the clinical significance of their results, including the potential impact on patient care and outcomes. Additionally, it would be helpful to include more analysis on the errors made by the model, such as the types of medications that are most commonly misclassified. The authors may also want to consider evaluating their model on a larger and more diverse dataset to demonstrate its generalizability.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How do the authors plan to address the issue of label noise in the data, which is acknowledged as a limitation of the study? (2) Can the authors provide more insight into the interpretability of the RNN model, such as the features that are most important for predicting medication classes? (3) How do the authors envision their model being integrated into clinical practice, and what are the potential barriers to adoption?
