Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a new approach to understanding and improving the performance of dropout, a widely used technique for training deep neural networks. The authors formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of a latent variable model, which enables them to analyze the inference gap between the training and inference phases of dropout. They introduce the concept of expectation-linear dropout neural networks, which can be used to quantify and control the inference gap. The authors also propose a regularization scheme to explicitly control the inference gap, which can be used to improve the performance of dropout. The paper provides theoretical analysis and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
