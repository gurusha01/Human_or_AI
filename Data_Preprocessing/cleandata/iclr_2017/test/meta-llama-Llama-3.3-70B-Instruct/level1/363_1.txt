Summary of the Paper
The paper proposes a general "compare-aggregate" framework for sequence matching problems in natural language processing. The framework consists of a preprocessing layer, an attention layer, a comparison layer, and an aggregation layer using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The authors focus on the comparison layer and evaluate six different comparison functions, including neural network-based and element-wise operation-based functions. The model is tested on four different datasets, including MovieQA, InsuranceQA, WikiQA, and SNLI, and achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.
Decision
I decide to Accept this paper with minor revisions.

The paper tackles a specific and important problem in natural language processing, namely sequence matching, and proposes a general framework that can be applied to various tasks. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of different comparison functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on multiple datasets. The paper is well-written, and the experiments are well-designed and thoroughly executed.
Supporting Arguments
The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the "compare-aggregate" framework and its components. The authors motivate the use of different comparison functions and provide a thorough analysis of their results. The experiments are well-designed, and the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets, models, and hyperparameters used.

Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more analysis on the computational efficiency of their model and its scalability to longer sequences. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more visualizations of the attention weights and the convolutional layer to gain a better understanding of how the model works. The authors may also consider providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the model to different hyperparameters.
