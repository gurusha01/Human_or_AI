This paper proposes a novel approach to navigation in complex environments using deep reinforcement learning (RL) with auxiliary tasks. The authors formulate navigation as an RL problem and demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary tasks, such as depth prediction and loop closure detection, can significantly improve data efficiency and task performance. The approach is evaluated in various 3D maze environments, and the results show that the proposed method can learn to navigate from raw sensory input, approaching human-level performance in some cases.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the field of AI, namely navigation in complex environments, and provides a clear and well-motivated approach to addressing this problem. Secondly, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, including a detailed analysis of the agent's behavior and performance in various environments.
The paper supports its claims through a combination of theoretical and empirical results. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed approach, including the use of auxiliary tasks to improve data efficiency and task performance. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various environments, including static and dynamic mazes. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the agent's behavior, including its ability to localize and navigate in complex environments.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of the proposed method with other state-of-the-art navigation methods, such as SLAM-based approaches.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify the following points: (1) How do the auxiliary tasks affect the agent's ability to generalize to new environments? (2) Can the proposed method be applied to other domains beyond navigation, such as robotic manipulation or game playing? (3) How does the use of auxiliary tasks impact the computational complexity of the proposed method? 
Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of AI, and the proposed method has the potential to be applied to a wide range of navigation tasks. With some minor revisions to address the above points, the paper is ready for publication.
