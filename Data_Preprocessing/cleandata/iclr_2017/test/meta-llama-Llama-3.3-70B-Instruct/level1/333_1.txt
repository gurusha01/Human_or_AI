Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural image generation, specifically in the area of texture synthesis. The authors demonstrate that a single-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with random filters can generate high-quality textures that rival the state-of-the-art approaches. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that deep hierarchical representations and trained feature maps are essential for natural texture generation. The paper also introduces a quantitative texture quality measure based on the synthesis loss in the VGG-based model, which provides a more objective evaluation of texture quality.
Decision: Accept
I decide to accept this paper due to its innovative approach, thorough experimentation, and well-supported claims. The paper addresses a specific question/problem, namely, what aspects of feature representation are crucial for natural image generation, and provides a clear and well-motivated answer.
Supporting Arguments
The paper's approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough review of the literature on texture synthesis. The experimental results are extensive and well-documented, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed single-layer CNN with random filters. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the importance of combining multiple filter sizes and the role of non-linearities in texture synthesis.
Additional Feedback
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider the following points:
* Provide more discussion on the implications of their findings for the broader field of natural image generation.
* Consider adding more visual examples of the synthesized textures to illustrate the quality of the results.
* Provide more details on the optimization procedure used to tune the hyperparameters of the single-layer CNN.
Questions for the Authors
To clarify my understanding of the paper, I would like the authors to answer the following questions:
* Can you provide more insight into why the random filters perform as well as or better than the filters trained on natural images?
* How do you plan to extend this work to more complex image generation tasks, such as object synthesis or scene generation?
* Can you provide more details on the computational efficiency of the proposed single-layer CNN compared to the state-of-the-art approaches?
