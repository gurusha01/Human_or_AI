Summary of the Paper's Contributions
The paper presents an empirical investigation into the geometry of loss functions for state-of-the-art neural networks, exploring how different stochastic optimization methods interact with these loss functions. The authors conduct a series of experiments on three neural network architectures, analyzing the performance of five popular gradient-descent optimization methods and a new method based on Runge-Kutta integrators. The results provide insights into the types of local minima found by different optimization algorithms, the effects of batch normalization, and the implications for generalization error.
