This paper proposes a Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory access, which allows for more flexible and expressive attention mechanisms. The model is applied to question answering based on knowledge bases, where it demonstrates improved performance over existing methods, particularly in handling composition of relations and conjunction of conditions.
I decide to accept this paper for several reasons. Firstly, the paper tackles a specific and well-defined problem in the area of neural memory access and question answering. The approach is well-motivated, building on existing work in attention mechanisms and knowledge base embedding. The use of a Gaussian attention model is a novel and interesting contribution, allowing for more nuanced and flexible attention mechanisms.
The paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model, including the mathematical formulation and the training objective. The experimental evaluation is thorough, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model on a range of question answering tasks, including path queries and conjunctive queries. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods, including TransE and TransH, on several metrics, including mean filtered rank and H@1.
One potential weakness of the paper is the limited scope of the experimental evaluation, which focuses on a single dataset (WorldCup2014) and a specific set of question answering tasks. However, the paper provides a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed model and its evaluation, making it easy to follow and understand.
To improve the paper, I would suggest providing more analysis and discussion of the results, particularly in terms of the strengths and limitations of the proposed model. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more context and comparison to existing work in the area, highlighting the novelty and significance of the proposed contribution.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include:
* Can you provide more intuition and explanation of the Gaussian attention model, particularly in terms of how it differs from existing attention mechanisms?
* How do you handle cases where the knowledge base is incomplete or noisy, and how does the proposed model robustly handle such cases?
* Can you provide more details on the experimental setup and evaluation metrics used, particularly in terms of how the question answering tasks were generated and evaluated?
