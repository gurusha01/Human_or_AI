This study presents a thorough and well-structured investigation into predicting medication from diagnostic codes, demonstrating a strong command of both methodology and writing. The comparison of various models, including GRUs, LSTMs, feed-forward networks, and random forests - with a justified preference for random forests over SVMs - is comprehensive and sheds valuable light on prediction outcomes and embedding analyses.
The authors have satisfactorily addressed the concerns and questions posed by reviewers, enhancing the clarity and robustness of the work. However, one potential drawback is that the focus and implications of this research may align more closely with the interests of data science or medical conferences, potentially making it less suited for a venue like ICLR.
