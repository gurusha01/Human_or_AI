This manuscript presents a large-scale visual search system tailored for a fashion website, leveraging Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for multi-label attribute recognition and state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN for feature extraction within regions of interest (ROIs). However, the technical novelty of this work is unclear, as it primarily employs standard, state-of-the-art methodologies without introducing significant innovations. Alternative approaches, such as utilizing binary models or modifying the cross-entropy loss function, are available for multi-label recognition tasks but are not compared to the RNN method. Furthermore, the sequential prediction order in the RNN is ambiguous, although it appears to follow a tree hierarchy of attributes. 
The manuscript also suffers from poor presentation. The results are largely based on an internal dataset, which the authors are unwilling to release, limiting the reproducibility and broader evaluation of the proposed system.
