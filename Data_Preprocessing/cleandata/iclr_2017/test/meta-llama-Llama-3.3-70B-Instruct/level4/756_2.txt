This paper presents a method utilizing feed-forward neural networks to generate similarity-preserving embeddings. Additionally, it applies this concept to represent out-of-vocabulary words by leveraging the context in which they appear.
Initially, in light of existing research [1,2], the proposed methodology offers limited innovative contributions. Notably, the enhancement over word2vec through Context Encoders is relatively minor.
The experimental design would benefit from more compelling outcomes beyond visual representations and the utilization of a non-standard benchmark for evaluating named entity recognition (NER) with word vectors [3].
