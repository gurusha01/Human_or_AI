The authors of this paper investigate the necessity of chaotic behavior in RNNs to achieve strong performance on certain tasks, proposing a chaos-free architecture to test this hypothesis. The experimental results support the claim that chaos is not a required component. 
This work is notable for its refreshing approach, as it begins with a well-defined hypothesis and rigorously tests it, potentially laying the groundwork for future RNN design principles. 
One limitation of the study is that the experiments are restricted to tasks with relatively low dynamical systems demands; it would be beneficial for the authors to explore a broader range of datasets to identify scenarios where chaos is indeed essential.
