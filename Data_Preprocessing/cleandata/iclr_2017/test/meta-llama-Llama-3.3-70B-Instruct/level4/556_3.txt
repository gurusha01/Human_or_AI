This manuscript presents a comprehensive examination of the error loss function across various optimization techniques, with a clear and engaging presentation that effectively conveys the information. The experimental methodology is adequately described, allowing for a thorough understanding of the approach. Theoretical assessments of this nature are essential for numerous applications, as they facilitate a deeper understanding and improvement of convergence behavior in given systems.
Strengths:
- The analysis provided is significant and relevant
- The visual aids are effective and well-utilized
Weaknesses:
- While the paper notes that optima differ among optimization methods, it fails to delve into the underlying reasons for these discrepancies or propose solutions, with the exception of batch normalization
- Certain graphical elements, such as Figure 5, feature font sizes that are excessively small, potentially hindering readability
