This manuscript explores the application of transfer learning to question answering (QA) tasks based on narrative texts, where a system is tasked with responding to a query after being presented with a brief story. The research investigates the feasibility of utilizing a system trained on one dataset to answer questions from a different dataset. However, the findings suggest that transfer learning is largely ineffective in this context.
The paper primarily focuses on presenting negative outcomes, as the central hypothesis of transferring knowledge between QA datasets using the attention sum reader proves to be unachievable. Instead, a small amount of labeled data from the target dataset is required to attain meaningful performance. While reporting negative results can be valuable, it is essential to provide a thorough analysis of the failure modes and underlying reasons to shed light on potential research directions.
Although the paper falls short in this regard, the responses to the pre-review questions offer some initial insights, such as the transferability of typing information. Further investigation into the impact of syntactic differences between datasets (e.g., bAbI, Gutenberg books, and CNN news articles) and the overlap of word, entity, and n-gram distributions across the three datasets could yield valuable information. Unfortunately, the manuscript ultimately lacks substantial takeaways, limiting its overall contribution to the field.
