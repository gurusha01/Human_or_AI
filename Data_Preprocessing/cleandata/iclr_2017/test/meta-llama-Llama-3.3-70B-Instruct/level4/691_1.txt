This paper introduces the Retro Learning Environment (RLE), a novel framework for reinforcement learning, with a primary focus on Super Nintendo and potential support for other platforms, including the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The authors provide benchmark results for established algorithms in five new Super Nintendo games, along with an assessment using a newly proposed "rivalry metric".
The development of standardized environments and evaluation methodologies, such as public datasets and competitions, has historically played a crucial role in advancing the quality of research in AI and machine learning. A notable example is the Atari Learning Environment (ALE), which has become a benchmark for comparing algorithms and results. In this context, the RLE has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field by introducing new challenging domains for research.
However, the primary emphasis of this paper lies in presenting the RLE framework and highlighting the importance of exploring new domains, rather than providing groundbreaking experimental results. The experiments themselves involve existing algorithms, with some notable findings on the benefits of reward shaping and policy shaping, such as incorporating a bias towards moving right in Super Mario. While these results demonstrate the value of domain knowledge, this insight is somewhat intuitive. The concept of rivalry training is intriguing, as it shows that training against a specific opponent can lead to overfitting, causing the learner to forget how to play against the in-game AI, which is then used for evaluation.
Unfortunately, the section of the paper discussing the scientific results, particularly the rivalry training, lacks polish, which is disappointing. Overall, I found the paper to be less exciting than anticipated, as I had hoped for a more substantial scientific contribution to accompany the introduction of the RLE. It is unclear whether such a contribution is necessary for publication, but it is also uncertain whether ICLR is the most suitable venue for this work, given that the primary contribution is the development of new code, which might be more appropriately showcased on platforms like mloss.org or through the journal track of JMLR.
