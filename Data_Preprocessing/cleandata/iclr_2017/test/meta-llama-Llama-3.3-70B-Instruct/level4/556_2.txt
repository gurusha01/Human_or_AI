I commend the authors' efforts, but I find the paper lacking in clarity. 
Notably, the term "local minima" is repeatedly mentioned (~70 times) without sufficient evidence, except perhaps in Figure 11, to demonstrate that the obtained solutions are not merely local minima. 
The authors overlook the fact that cross-sections of a non-convex problem can resemble those presented in the paper. 
It is a well-established fact that first-order methods can struggle with certain non-convex, ill-conditioned problems, even in low-dimensional, noiseless scenarios, and the point at which they fail to make progress is not necessarily a local minimum. 
Certain statements, such as the one below, suggest that the study may not delve deeply enough into the subject: 
"One of the interesting empirical observations is that we often observe the incremental improvement of optimization methods decreasing rapidly, even in non-convex problems."
