The concept presented is intriguing, but the work appears incomplete. Notably, the model size reduction achieved does not match the significant factors reported in previous studies, such as Song 2016, where a reduction to 5 bits was accomplished, albeit in conjunction with pruning, resulting in an overall 49X reduction in the size of the VGG model without sacrificing accuracy. The incorporation of pruning or similar techniques could potentially yield comparable, if not superior, reductions, especially considering the achievement of 4-bit precision without loss of accuracy. However, without the inclusion of such comparisons in the paper, it remains challenging to assess the relative efficacy of the proposed approach.
