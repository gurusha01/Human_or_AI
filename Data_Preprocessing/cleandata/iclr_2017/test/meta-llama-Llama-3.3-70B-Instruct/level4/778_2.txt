I would like to request that the results be presented in a concise table, including both the original outcomes and those obtained after applying compression, across all tasks. Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the impact of compression on state-of-the-art networks where float representation plays a crucial role. Specifically, I am interested in seeing results for networks that achieve accuracy levels such as 0.5%-0.8% on MNIST or below 5%-10% on ImageNet. While these results may be achievable with float representation, they may be unattainable with restricted representations, and a thorough comparison would be valuable.
