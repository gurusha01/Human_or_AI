SUMMARY.
This paper introduces a novel scoring function, termed TransGaussian, for knowledge base embedding, which can be viewed as an extension of the established TransE scoring function. The efficacy of TransGaussian is evaluated through its application to two primary tasks: knowledge base completion and question answering.

OVERALL JUDGMENT
Although the proposed research is intriguing and warrants further exploration, the paper's presentation and experimental components exhibit several shortcomings. From a presentation standpoint, it appears that the work does not align with the conventional definition of an attention model as typically understood in the literature. Furthermore, the attempted analogy to memory networks and neural Turing machines is not compelling, as there is minimal overlap. Concerning the experimental section, a comprehensive comparison necessitates testing the model on widely recognized benchmarks and reporting outcomes relative to state-of-the-art models. A notable omission is the lack of in-depth discussion and analysis of the results, which would provide valuable insights into the behavior and performance of the proposed TransGaussian model.

DETAILED COMMENTS
In Section 2.2, the calculation of \mu_{context} raises a concern regarding the preservation of relational order. Specifically, does the method employed by the authors inadvertently discard the order of relations, and if so, what implications does this have on the validity and usefulness of the approach?
