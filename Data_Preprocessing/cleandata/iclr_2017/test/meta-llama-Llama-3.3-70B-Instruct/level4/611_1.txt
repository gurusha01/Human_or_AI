The authors suggest utilizing a deep neural network to learn user and item embeddings for a recommendation task. However, their approach bears a strong resemblance to the existing CDL method, which also employs neural networks for recommendation purposes, with only slight distinctions. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation is compromised by the fact that the proposed DualNets method leverages a greater number of item features compared to WMF and CDL, rendering the comparisons biased.
