This manuscript integrates Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) with eligibility traces and investigates the utilization of the Adam optimizer for q-network optimization. The exploration of this approach is justified, and the experimental outcomes demonstrate the advantages of incorporating eligibility traces and the Adam optimizer in two Atari games. Although the methodologies employed are not innovative, the key contributions of this work lie in (1) the application of eligibility traces and the Adam optimizer to DRQN, and (2) the comprehensive experimental assessment. The paper is well-structured and clear in its presentation.
The experimental results provide a quantitative analysis and offer detailed qualitative insights into the performance of the methods, shedding light on their effectiveness. Nevertheless, the limited scope of the results, which only include two Atari games, makes it challenging to gauge the generalizability of the approach. Expanding the results to encompass additional games and/or other domains would substantially enhance the manuscript. Furthermore, incorporating error bars derived from multiple random seeds would also contribute to the paper's overall quality.
