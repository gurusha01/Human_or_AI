This manuscript presents a compare-aggregate framework, which employs word-level matching and subsequent aggregation utilizing convolutional neural networks. An evaluation of six distinct comparison functions is conducted across four datasets, yielding comprehensive experimental results that are benchmarked against multiple established baselines.
The overall quality of the writing in the paper is commendable.
Several specific observations and suggestions are noted:
* On page 4, line 5, a minor correction is recommended: "including a some" should be revised to "including some".
* The advantages and necessity of incorporating the preprocessing and attention steps are not explicitly clear. It would be beneficial to provide experimental results without these steps to assess their impact.
* Figure 2 is of poor legibility, particularly when reproduced in printed form. Enhancing the figure's quality would significantly improve its readability and the overall presentation of the results.
