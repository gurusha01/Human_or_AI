This manuscript focuses on mitigating the computational burden of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) during testing. A novel factorization technique is introduced, yielding promising outcomes. Although the comparison with existing methods is not exhaustive, the paper offers valuable perspectives and contributions to the field.
