Review- Quality:
This manuscript proposes a novel framework integrating active learning into deep learning architectures, primarily tackling the scalability challenges associated with training deep neural networks. 
However, the paper requires refinement, as it contains numerous grammatical and typographical errors that detract from its overall quality.
Clarity:
Substantial improvements are necessary to enhance the paper's clarity. The introduction's motivations, specifically the difficulties of implementing active learning in deep architectures, could be more thoroughly explained and explicitly connected to the methodology described in Section 3. For instance, the authors justify the need for (mini)batch label queries but fail to revisit this concept in Section 3, where their primary approach is outlined. 
The related work section, although systematic, appears somewhat disconnected from the paper's main content. Ideally, this section should contextualize the authors' work within the relevant literature, highlighting its pros and cons rather than serving as a comprehensive literature survey. To achieve this, the authors might consider condensing less relevant explanations while dedicating more space to discussing and comparing their work with closely related studies, such as Graves (2011).
Originality & Significance:
The authors introduce an active learning framework for training deep neural networks, conceptualizing network parameter optimization as a Bayesian inference problem, an idea previously explored by Graves. They formulate the active learning problem as sampling the most informative data, with informativeness defined by variational free energy, which is dependent on Fisher information. To mitigate the computational complexity of inverting the Fisher Information matrix, the authors propose approximation techniques that appear to be novel.
In my opinion, this paper explores an intriguing direction by adapting deep learning to label-expensive problems through active learning. Nevertheless, significant improvements in presentation are necessary to elevate the manuscript's quality and clarity.
