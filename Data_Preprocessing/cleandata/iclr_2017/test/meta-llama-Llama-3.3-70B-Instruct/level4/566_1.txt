This paper presents an active learning approach that utilizes pool-based selection of deep learning mini-batches, leveraging an approximate Bayesian posterior. The methodology involves several approximations of key terms.
The proposed Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Bayesian inference framework for active learning, along with its associated approximations and theoretical underpinnings, is intriguing yet challenging to comprehend due to its complexity.
The writing quality is compromised by poor English, which occasionally makes the text cumbersome to read.
While the description of alternative active learning strategies could be more concise, the authors' proposed method, with its numerous complex approximations, would benefit significantly from a more detailed and structured explanation. Additionally, the inclusion of another dataset would strengthen the paper, as the current datasets (gray digits and USPS) share similarities and may not fully demonstrate the approach's versatility.
