The authors have compiled a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in convolutional neural network design, specifically for image classification, and have identified 14 fundamental principles that underlie the field. These principles, accompanied by relevant references, offer valuable insights that would be beneficial to newcomers in the field. The authors have applied these principles to various architectures on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
The authors have assembled a thorough collection of references on the subject, organizing them in a manner that is particularly useful for early-career researchers. It is evident that the authors have conducted an extensive exploration of architectural modifications as part of their experiments, and the availability of their codebase is a notable advantage.
However, the writing often appears disjointed, and the rationale behind certain design principles is not clearly articulated. For instance, "Design Pattern 4: Increase Symmetry" is presented as a core principle without further elaboration or justification, merely suggesting that architectural symmetry is a desirable trait. Similarly, "Design Pattern 6: Over-train" is introduced mid-paragraph without supporting references or additional explanation.
The experimental section of the paper appears fragmented, with multiple approaches being presented based on subsets of the design principles. Generally, these approaches either involve minor modifications to existing networks, such as alternative FractalNet pooling strategies, or novel architectures that fail to demonstrate significant improvements. The exception is the Fractal-of-Fractal network, which achieves marginally improved accuracy but at the cost of introducing substantially more network parameters, thereby increasing capacity.
Preliminary rating:
While the endeavor to collect and synthesize research from diverse sources to identify patterns and gaps in the field is commendable, some of the presented patterns appear underdeveloped, and certain principles are poorly explained. Furthermore, the innovative architectures motivated by these principles either fall short of expectations or achieve slightly improved accuracy at the expense of introducing many more parameters, as seen in the case of Fractal-Of-Fractal networks. For a paper focused on higher-level design trends, more rigorous experimentation around each principle would be appreciated, rather than the introduction of novel architectures.
