A novel layer-wise optimization approach for CNNs utilizing ReLU activations and max-pooling is presented, which is equivalent to a series of latent structured SVM problems. The CCCP-style optimization method ensures a monotonic decrease in the overall objective function.
Summary:
———
Although the discussed concepts are intriguing, the presentation falls short of being persuasive. The claims made are often at odds with practical realities, such as the lack of convergence guarantees due to the use of mini-batches. Furthermore, the validity of statements, like the implications of monotone convergence, could be more convincingly substantiated. The experimental evaluation is also limited in scope. In essence, the paper requires refinement to craft a more compelling narrative.
Quality: Certain techniques could be described with greater care to enhance the intuitive understanding. Occasionally, comparisons are made between disparate entities, such as contrasting backpropagation with CCCP.
Clarity: The derivations and underlying intuitions could benefit from more detailed explanations.
Originality: The proposed idea is reasonable, although it relies on heuristics.
Significance: Given the limited experimental setup, it is challenging to assess the significance of the work at this juncture.

1. While the theoretical guarantees provided for the optimization procedure are convenient, their practical applicability remains to be demonstrated more convincingly. For instance, mini-batch optimization mitigates the monotonic decrease, rendering the emphasis in the paper somewhat misplaced in my opinion, particularly in light of the current experimental evaluation.
2. Similar in spirit to the work by B. Amos and J. Kolter, Input-Convex Deep Networks, the authors' approach warrants a more thorough comparison to establish its novelty and contribution to the field.
