This manuscript presents an amortized variant of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method, wherein a neural network is designed to replicate the SVGD dynamics, and applies this approach to generative adversarial training, yielding a training procedure that interprets the discriminator as an energy-based probabilistic model.
A significant concern with the presentation is that it dedicates considerable effort to establishing the groundwork for a method purported to have broad applicability, yet the empirical evaluation is confined to a single, specific context. In my opinion, the paper either fails to adequately demonstrate the widespread applicability of the proposed method or allocates insufficient space to evaluating SteinGAN, having spent too much time laying the foundation.
Consequently, the empirical results provided are insufficient to justify the proposed approach. Furthermore, as noted by another reviewer, DCGAN is becoming an outdated benchmark for comparison. The qualitative assessment reveals that SteinGAN samples do not exhibit substantial improvements over DCGAN samples, with the exception of the CelebA dataset, where the origin of the DCGAN samples is unclear, as they do not appear to match those presented in the original DCGAN paper.
From a quantitative perspective, DCGAN outperforms SteinGAN by a narrow margin in terms of the ImageNet Inception Score, while SteinGAN surpasses DCGAN by an even smaller margin in the CIFAR10 Inception Score. Moreover, I believe the "testing accuracy" metric is not a compelling evaluation tool, as it solely measures information relevant to the discrimination task, rather than the broader modeling task. For example, this metric is likely insensitive to information present in the image background.
In light of these concerns, I do not consider the manuscript to be ready for publication at ICLR.
