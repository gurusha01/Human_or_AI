The authors suggest employing an off-policy actor-critic algorithm in a batch setting to enhance the performance of chat-bots. 
The methodology is well-justified and the paper is clearly articulated, with the exception of providing insufficient insight into why the batch version surpasses the online version (as noted in the comments regarding "clarification regarding batch vs. online setting"). 
The synthetic experiments are informative, and the real-world experiments were conducted comprehensively, although they only demonstrate a moderate improvement in outcomes.
