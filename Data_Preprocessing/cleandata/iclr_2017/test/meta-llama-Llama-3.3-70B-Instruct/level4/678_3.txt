This study examines the efficacy of transfer learning when applied to low-resource environments (bAbI, SQuAD benchmarks) after being trained on resource-rich datasets (BookTest, CNN/Daily Mail corpora). The experimental results indicate limited gains in zero-shot learning scenarios, but some improvement is noted when the model is fine-tuned with a small number of training examples.
However, a more in-depth examination is necessary to substantiate the claims presented. The utilization of bAbI as a representative low-resource, real-world scenario is questionable, as it is primarily designed as a unit test and lacks the complexity and diversity of natural language phenomena. Consequently, the findings related to bAbI provide limited evidence for assessing the effectiveness of transfer learning from high-resource to low-resource settings in real-world applications. It is strongly recommended that the authors consider incorporating more recently proposed, realistic scenarios [1,2] into their analysis.
A more significant concern is that the research fails to provide a clear explanation for the observed improvements resulting from transfer learning. While the authors speculate that the knowledge transferred is not solely embedded in the model's embeddings but also in its architecture, this hypothesis is not thoroughly explored. In light of existing research [3], the novelty of these claims is limited, and a more central focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying transfer learning is essential to strengthen the work.
