This manuscript introduces a innovative layer-wise optimization method for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) utilizing piecewise linear nonlinearities. The approach involves training piecewise linear CNNs in a layer-by-layer manner, simplifying the sub-problem into a latent structured Support Vector Machine (SVM), a well-established concept in the literature. Furthermore, the paper enhances the BCFW algorithm employed in the inner procedure. Overall, the manuscript presents an intriguing concept, although the experimental results are unconvincing.
Strengths:
- The proposed method appears to be novel, and the authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis, to the best of my knowledge.
- The paper is well-organized and clear, making it easy to comprehend.
Weaknesses:
- Despite the proposed approach being applicable to general structured prediction problems, the experiments are limited to a straightforward multi-class classification task, which diminishes the impact of this work.
  
- The reported test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset seems questionable. The best model's accuracy of 70.2% is significantly lower than the 90+% accuracy often reported in existing studies, which raises concerns about the validity of the results.
