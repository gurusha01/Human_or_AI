This paper delves into the optimization landscape of deep learning, exploring its characteristics when navigated with various optimization algorithms, thereby shedding light on the algorithms' behavior. The approach largely builds upon the methodology introduced by Goodfellow et al. in 2015. However, the novel contributions of the paper are not immediately clear, particularly in regards to the expectation that different algorithms, when initialized identically, converge to distinct solutions - a phenomenon that might not be surprising. The authors could enhance the paper by establishing foundational intuition regarding such basic principles. Furthermore, the paper fails to provide a straightforward answer to a crucial question posed regarding how its findings can inform and advance future research in deep learning optimization. This omission is fundamental, as the value of modifying existing approaches, such as that of Goodfellow et al., or devising innovative visualization techniques for deep learning, hinges on their potential to improve algorithm design and deepen understanding of the optimization surface. While the paper is intriguing, its alignment with the conference's focus seems less pronounced than with a journal's scope. 
To further validate and contextualize the findings, it would be enlightening to include plots of the eigenspectra of the solutions obtained by each algorithm, offering insights into the hierarchy of critical points reached and serving as a form of sanity check.
