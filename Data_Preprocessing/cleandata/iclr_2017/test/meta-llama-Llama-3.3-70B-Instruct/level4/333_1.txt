This study presents a straightforward yet robust baseline for parametric texture synthesis, demonstrating that samples generated using multi-scale and random filters can occasionally match the performance of the VGG-based model, which utilizes multi-layer and pre-trained filters. The authors infer that texture synthesis may not necessarily rely on deep hierarchical representations or learned feature maps. 
The work is undoubtedly intriguing and provides valuable insights. Nevertheless, further validation of the conclusions is required, particularly with regards to deep hierarchical representations. Notably, the generated samples from both the VGG and single-layer models exhibit imperfections and fall short of the quality achieved by non-parametric methods. Additionally, the VGG-based model appears to perform better in the inpainting task, as shown in Figure 7. Moreover, it is worth investigating whether a hierarchical model, as opposed to relying on numerous filters of varying sizes, could more efficiently handle multi-scale processing.
