This manuscript leverages the pointer network architecture, which utilizes an attention mechanism to selectively focus on input sequence elements, enabling the decoder to generate these elements as output, to tackle straightforward combinatorial optimization problems, including the notorious traveling salesman problem. The network is trained using reinforcement learning, specifically an actor-critic approach, where the actor is trained via the REINFORCE method and the critic estimates the reward baseline within the REINFORCE objective.
The paper is well-structured and clear, presenting a novel application of reinforcement learning and attention models to learn the structural properties of spaces where combinatorial problems of varying sizes can be addressed. This approach offers an intriguing avenue for re-examining traditional neural-based solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using contemporary sequence-to-sequence methods, making it a worthy candidate for conference consideration.
However, I have several comments and significant concerns regarding the manuscript:
1) I disagree with the authors' assertion that the pointer network approach can be applied to general combinatorial optimization problems. The essence of real-world combinatorial problems lies in their complex constraints, which define feasible solutions (e.g., time windows or multiple salesmen in TSP generalizations). For such problems, excluding possible solutions by simply eliminating previously visited instances is no longer straightforward. In fact, finding a single feasible solution can be a significant challenge. It would be beneficial to discuss whether the proposed Neural Combinatorial Optimization approach can be scaled to these critical problem classes and, if so, how. In my understanding, the presented approach is primarily suited for assignment problems with simple constraint structures.
2) The operations research literature features numerous benchmark problems, such as those found in TSPLIB, which contain a large number of TSP instances, allowing for the comparison of solver quality. It would be beneficial to include these benchmark problems in the evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the authors should consider comparing their results with state-of-the-art solvers to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their method's performance and potential limitations. 
3) (Assumed to be part of the original review, though not provided) Additional comments and reservations may include discussions on the scalability of the model, the interpretability of the results, and potential avenues for future research, maintaining the technical content and structure of the original review intact.
