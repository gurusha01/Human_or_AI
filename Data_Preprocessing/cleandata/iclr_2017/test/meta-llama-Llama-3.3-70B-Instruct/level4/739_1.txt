The authors introduce a novel algorithm for efficiently computing polynomial features on sparse matrices, leveraging a clever mapping between matrices and their polynomial counterparts to develop an effective Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) expansion algorithm. Their analysis of time complexity is well-supported by experimental results.
In general, the proposed algorithm is intriguing, straightforward, and elegant, with a wide range of potential applications. However, the experimental evaluation and exploration of the algorithm's applications are somewhat lacking in depth. Moreover, the connection between this work and the primary focus of ICLR is not immediately clear, suggesting that resubmission to a more suitable venue might be a better fit.
