This paper presents a methodology that integrates super-resolution and inpainting into the GAN framework for semi-supervised learning, leveraging the discriminative features of GANs on larger images.
Although the central concept of the paper is not particularly groundbreaking, as the utility of GAN discriminative features in semi-supervised learning has been previously demonstrated in works such as CatGAN, DCGAN, and those by Salimans et al., the authors successfully implement the semi-supervised GAN framework on larger images, including the STL-10 and Pascal datasets, using their proposed context conditioning approach. This achievement results in state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.
However, I believe it is essential for the authors to provide an SSL-GAN baseline for the Pascal dataset to facilitate a comparison between the contribution of their context conditioning idea and the standard method of using GANs for semi-supervised learning. It is unclear why the SSL-GAN cannot be applied to the 64x64 and 96x96 versions of the Pascal dataset, as shown in Table 3. If the authors encountered difficulties in training the vanilla GAN on the Pascal dataset, even at a 64x64 image size, this should be explicitly stated and explained in the paper. My concern stems from the fact that CC-GAN nearly matches the SSL-GAN baseline on the STL-10 dataset, and CC-GAN2 appears to be an ad-hoc enhancement of the core CC-GAN concept. Therefore, comparing CC-GAN and SSL-GAN on an alternative dataset, even a downsampled Pascal dataset, would be beneficial.
