This paper presents a novel correction technique that enables the combination of updates from multiple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterations to achieve statistical equivalence with sequential techniques.
Key observations include:
1) The proposed approach offers a unique and intriguing method for correcting updates, even in scenarios where updates are delayed, which is a notable contribution.
2) However, the theoretical framework underlying the proposed method is restricted to square loss settings with linear update rules, which somewhat limits its applicability. To enhance its relevance and appeal to the ICLR community, it would be beneficial to extend the technique to accommodate general objective functions and settings commonly encountered in deep neural networks.
3) The implementation of the resulting technique necessitates the maintenance of a dimensionally reduced combiner matrix, which introduces additional computational complexity. Although the authors suggest that this overhead can be mitigated with SIMD support for symbolic updates, it is also possible that standard SGD updates could benefit from SIMD, particularly in cases involving dense datasets.
In summary, while the practical implications of this work are somewhat constrained by limitations in its applicability and computational efficiency, the correction technique proposed herein (particularly the correction rule) may still be of interest to researchers focused on scaling up learning processes. To increase its appeal to the ICLR community, the authors are encouraged to explore extensions of the method to non-linear objective functions, which could significantly enhance its relevance and impact.
