This manuscript demonstrates the effectiveness of a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework, enhanced by auxiliary tasks, in navigating complex environments. The approach leverages A3C to tackle the RL problem, while concurrently training the agent on unsupervised depth prediction and self-supervised loop closure classification tasks. Although utilizing auxiliary tasks to enhance model training, including RL agents, is an established concept, the primary innovation lies in employing tasks that foster the development of an intrinsic spatial and movement representation, thereby yielding substantial improvements in maze navigation tasks.
The paper is well-structured, and the experiments are persuasive, clearly illustrating the benefits of auxiliary tasks in addressing the problem. Nevertheless, the contribution, while valuable, is somewhat incremental, given the existing body of work on RL for navigation and auxiliary tasks. To elevate the significance of this research, a more comprehensive analysis and deeper insights into the optimal combination of tasks for visual navigation (such as the potential benefits of alternative visual or geometry-based tasks) or the broader application of auxiliary tasks in RL would be necessary. In its current form, the manuscript provides a useful illustration of the advantages of geometry-based auxiliary tasks for navigation, albeit with a relatively narrow scope.
