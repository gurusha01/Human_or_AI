This paper is well-crafted, coherent, and engaging, making for a pleasant reading experience. The authors deserve praise for their meticulous attention to storytelling and explanatory details. Although it does not introduce novel methodologies or architectural innovations, it tackles a significant application: predicting patient medication usage based on billing code records. The employed dataset is noteworthy, both in terms of its scale and relevance, surpassing the typical simplistic datasets commonly used in machine learning research. However, the analysis of the results could be more comprehensive, as is often expected in empirical or application-focused papers. It is commendable that the authors have incorporated state-of-the-art tools (such as Keras and Adadelta) into their framework, despite the primary focus on application. Several points warrant critique:
- The presentation of numerical results seems somewhat concise. Figures 4 and 5, with the latter being largely a negative outcome (as tSNE is interpretable only in certain contexts), leave Table 1 as the primary source of empirical evidence. Given the reliance on a single dataset, the depth of analysis and empirical evidence is not as extensive as one might anticipate from a paper that does not offer significant algorithmic or theoretical advancements. While not a major concern, this aspect feels slightly underdeveloped.
- Constructively, regarding the results, it would be beneficial to replace Figure 5 with a more substantive performance analysis. Figure 5 is largely uninformative beyond serving as a negative result, which could be succinctly stated without dedicating a figure to it.
- The paper includes specialized terminology and presupposes a level of expertise that may not be universally familiar to the typical ICLR audience. Another reviewer suggested that a medical or healthcare conference might be a more appropriate venue for this work. While acknowledging the validity of this perspective, I believe the machine learning community benefits from thoughtful, in-depth applications like this one. Instead of changing the venue, it would be more productive to clarify the technical jargon and make the results more accessible for evaluation by an ICLR reader. Currently, researchers without a medical background must accept the findings post-Table 1 at face value, rather than being able to apply their quantitative analysis skills.
Overall, the paper is of good quality.
