This manuscript presents an incremental enhancement to the DeepRS framework, with the primary contribution stemming from the integration of user-item factors in predictive modeling. Although the motivation behind this approach is well-articulated, the modifications to the model architecture are relatively subtle. 
To strengthen the paper, I recommend that the authors delve deeper into the implications of introducing coupling, potentially through isolated experiments that systematically alter the loss function and architecture, progressing from a non-coupled to the proposed coupled network. This would effectively demonstrate the significance of coupling.
A notable omission in the paper is a discussion on time complexity, which is crucial given that the coupled network would likely incur significantly higher computational costs for generating recommendations. The authors should address how this increased complexity might impact real-world applications.
In its current form, while the paper shows promise, I believe it requires further refinement before it can be considered for acceptance.
