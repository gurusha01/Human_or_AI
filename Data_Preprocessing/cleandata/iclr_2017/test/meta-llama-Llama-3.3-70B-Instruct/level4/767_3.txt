In the response provided, the authors reference and compare their work to existing studies, such as "Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent". However, a key distinction lies in the objectives of these works, with the latter introducing a novel optimization algorithm, which is not the focus of the current research. Furthermore, Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization techniques typically target multiple hyper-parameters, whereas this study only tunes a single hyper-parameter.
The experimental setup, utilizing an outdated network architecture for CIFAR-10, yields performance metrics that are significantly inferior to those reported in recent publications. Consequently, the comparisons drawn are not entirely valid, as a demonstration of the method's superiority would necessitate the use of state-of-the-art network architectures to verify whether the claimed advantages persist.
As previously noted, the additional computational cost associated with hyper-parameter optimizers is only warranted if the method can achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple contemporary datasets. 
In summary, while the concept of employing an actor-critic network as a meta-learner is intriguing, the specific application proposed in this work appears to lack practical significance. The reported results are limited, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the method, and thus, it is difficult to draw conclusive insights regarding its potential benefits.
