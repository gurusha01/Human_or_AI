The paper proposes a novel application of rectified factor networks, previously introduced by the same authors, to the task of biclustering. Although the approach appears promising, the presentation is marred by significant issues.
Quality:
The methodology primarily builds upon techniques outlined in a 2015 NIPS paper by largely the same author group. However, the experimental methodology requires further clarification. The results, particularly those in Table 2, seem heavily dependent on cluster sparsity, yet the authors fail to provide a detailed explanation of how the sparsity hyperparameter is determined.
Clarity:
The writing style is subpar and falls short of the standards expected in a scientific publication, resembling instead an industry white paper or promotional material. A thorough rewrite is essential before the paper can be considered for publication. Notably, all references to companies utilizing the authors' methods must be removed.
Furthermore, Table 1 is virtually illegible. It is recommended that the table be revised by removing engineering notation and presenting numbers on a per 1000 basis, such that "0.475 +/- 9e-4" would be reformatted as "475 +/- 0.9". In general, figures are preferable for presenting results in the main text, with tables relegated to supplementary information.
Originality:
The work's novelty is somewhat limited, as the method is largely derived from a 2015 NIPS paper by the same authors. While the experimental evaluation appears partially novel, certain aspects, such as IBD detection, bear a strong resemblance to Hochreiter (2013) without providing a comparative analysis.
Significance:
The authors' primary claim is based on the method's strong empirical performance on their proprietary benchmark problems. However, the usefulness of this claim to others is uncertain, given the lack of available code and incomplete implementation details. Moreover, the method relies on numerous specific tuning parameters, whose tuning methodology is not fully defined, leaving doubts about the generalizability of the reported good performance.
