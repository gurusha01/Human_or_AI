This manuscript explores the development of unsupervised state representations through multi-task reinforcement learning. The authors introduce a innovative method that integrates gated neural networks with multi-task learning, incorporating robotics priors. Their approach is validated on two simulated datasets, yielding encouraging outcomes. The paper is well-structured and demonstrates theoretical rigor.
Strengths:
+ The incorporation of gating mechanisms facilitates the learning of a unified representation.
+ The extension of multi-task learning from single-task scenarios in previous research is a notable contribution.
+ The combination of various loss functions (including Coherence, Proportionality, Causality, Repeatability, Consistency, and Separation) enables the development of a robust representation.
Weaknesses:
- The selection of parameters (notably w parameters) appears to be somewhat arbitrary.
- The multi-task learning framework is restricted to distinct individual tasks, rather than leveraging shared knowledge and transfer learning between tasks.
- The use of a standardized simulation platform, such as OpenAI Gym, would have enhanced the comparability of the experimental results.
To further strengthen the manuscript, I suggest that the authors consider adopting a more systematic approach to model parameter selection and evaluate their method on more standardized, high-dimensional datasets.
