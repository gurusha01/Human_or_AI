The authors undertake the ambitious task of identifying a set of design patterns prevalent in current deep architectures, essentially creating a distributed representation of these complex systems.
Two aspects of the paper are particularly noteworthy: the comprehensive review of recent studies, which highlights the breadth of existing knowledge, and the authors' effort to provide a framework for newcomers to navigate the field, akin to establishing a coordinate system for deep architectures. This endeavor has the potential to be more impactful than introducing yet another technique, as it provides a foundational understanding of the subject.
However, in its current state, the work appears incomplete, and despite its promising premise, the authors' approach falls short. 
One concern lies in the selection process of the 14 identified patterns. For instance, Maxout, a specific nonlinearity, is categorized alongside more general principles like "Strive for simplicity," which raises questions about the criteria used for pattern selection.
Some patterns, such as "Increase symmetry," are overly vague and lack concrete applications beyond specific examples like FractalNet. It is unclear how such patterns can be universally applied to new architectures.
Additionally, certain pattern names, like "Cover the problem space" and "Over-train," are misleading or lack clear definitions. The concept of "Over-train" is particularly confusing, as it seems to conflate regularization with overfitting, potentially causing harm to inexperienced readers.
The extensions proposed in Section 4 also require clarification, particularly in how they relate to the previously discussed design patterns. The connection between the Taylor Series networks and the proposed patterns is not evident, and the organization of the section is confusing.
A more practical demonstration of how these design patterns can be applied to develop new networks is needed. For example, the authors mention the "freeze-drop-path" variant, allegedly derived from symmetry considerations, but fail to provide a clear explanation of how this variant embodies the "Increase symmetry" pattern.
A suggested improvement would be to include a table that maps design patterns to specific deep networks, illustrating which patterns are applied in each case. Furthermore, providing more detailed explanations of the concepts and techniques discussed in related works would enhance the paper's clarity.
Ultimately, while the authors' effort to systematize design patterns in deep architectures is commendable, the work requires further refinement to fully realize its potential. A revised version addressing these concerns would be more effective in conveying the authors' message and providing a valuable resource for the community.
