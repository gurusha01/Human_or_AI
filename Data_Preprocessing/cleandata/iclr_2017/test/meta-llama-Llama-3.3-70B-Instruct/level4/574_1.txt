This paper proposes a comprehensive visual search system designed to locate product images based on a given fashion item, presenting an intriguing investigation into the challenges associated with operating within this specific domain. The approach outlined in the paper effectively tackles several of these challenges, demonstrating a thoughtful consideration of the complexities involved.
However, several key issues must be addressed:
1) A significant concern is the absence of any comparison or reference to the substantial body of work by Tamara Berg's group on fashion recognition and attributes, including notable publications such as "Automatic Attribute Discovery and Characterization from Noisy Web Data" (ECCV 2010), "Where to Buy It: Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops" (ICCV 2015), and "Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing" (TPAMI 2014). Without discussing and comparing this work to the existing literature, it is challenging to fully appreciate the novelty and contribution of the proposed approach.
2) The paper lacks detailed information regarding the attribute dataset, including its source, the nature of the images (whether they are clean product images or real-world images), the annotation process, and the specific instructions provided to annotators. Understanding these qualitative aspects is crucial for grasping the paper's contributions and for facilitating comparisons with future studies. While certain data statistics may be proprietary, disclosing these details is essential for the scientific community to replicate and build upon this work.
3) The inclusion of additional baselines would strengthen the paper. For instance, a comparison of the results presented in Table 2 with simpler methodologies, such as the BM or CM methods mentioned in the text, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed system's efficacy.
In conclusion, although the paper offers an engaging exploration of visual search in the fashion domain, addressing these concerns is imperative to establish the work's validity and readiness for publication.
