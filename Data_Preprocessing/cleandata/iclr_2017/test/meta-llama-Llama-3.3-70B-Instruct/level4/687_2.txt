I found certain aspects of the introduction and background to be engaging, particularly the references to influential papers from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The proposed concept is straightforward, involving the removal of neurons based on the estimated change in the loss function using either first or second order backpropagation. As anticipated, the results indicate that the first order method is outperformed by the second order method, which in turn is outperformed by the brute force method.
However, I have several concerns that lead me to believe this work is not suitable for ICLR. Notably, the paper overlooks the significant advancements in understanding weight decay algorithms and their connection to Bayesian priors, which is a crucial omission. Any research in this area should, in my opinion, provide at least some discussion on this topic. Additionally, the text contains several statements that are not necessarily accurate, especially in the context of deep networks with modern regularization techniques. For instance, the authors claim that the brute-force method is the most accurate, but this assumption relies on the independence of neuronal effects, which may not always be the case. Consequently, the serial order of removal may not be optimal.
Furthermore, I believe the paper is excessively lengthy, and the idea and results could have been presented more concisely. I also think that simply including a Q&A section is insufficient, and the relevant points should be integrated into the main paper itself.
