This paper presents a straightforward and logical approach to graph node prediction and classification through a simple algorithm. The formulations are highly intuitive, resulting in a straightforward CNN-based training process that can readily exploit existing GPU acceleration capabilities.
The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, providing comparisons with numerous suitable baselines across large, real-world benchmark datasets. While my familiarity with the broader literature on alternative methods is limited, and acknowledging that link and node prediction have been long-standing problems with potentially similar solutions, I find the proposed approach to be reasonably simple and effectively validated by the experimental results.
