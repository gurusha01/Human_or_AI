The authors propose a novel approach to adaptive step size selection for SGD, framing the learning rate as an action within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the reward function is defined by the change in loss. This method is benchmarked against established adaptive first-order optimization techniques, such as Adagrad, Adam, and RMSProp, for deep network training. Although the findings are intriguing, a direct comparison is challenging due to differences in evaluation metrics. Several key points warrant further consideration:
- The computational cost of the actor-critic algorithm, relative to its counterparts, is not explicitly quantified. Notably, the absence of wall-time optimization plots is striking, given that the success of methods like Adagrad has historically been attributed to their efficiency in terms of wall-time performance rather than iteration count.
- The decision to learn a single, unified learning rate across all parameters is puzzling. For a more comprehensive comparison with other adaptive first-order methods, which often adapt learning rates on a per-parameter basis, it would be insightful to train separate RL models for each parameter, mirroring the adaptive strategies of popular first-order methods.
- Given that the learning process is inherently non-stationary, while RL algorithms presuppose a stationary environment, it is questionable whether an RL approach can effectively learn an optimal learning rate. The underlying assumption of stationarity in RL may not align with the dynamic nature of the learning process.
- Figure 6 prompts an interesting question regarding the comparison between the proposed method and techniques like early stopping. It is conceivable that the actor-critic method appears to overfit less not because it is inherently superior at regularization but because it may be less effective at optimization, potentially leading to underfitting. A more nuanced comparison, considering these aspects, would provide a clearer understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.
