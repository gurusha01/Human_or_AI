This manuscript presents a novel recurrent neural network variant, characterized by two orthogonal temporal dimensions, which can be utilized as a decoder for generating tree structures, including topology, within an encoder-decoder framework. The proposed architecture is well-justified, and its potential applications extend beyond those discussed in the paper, particularly in scenarios where tree structures need to be generated from unstructured data.
One notable limitation of the paper lies in the scope of its experimental evaluation. Although the IFTTT dataset and synthetic dataset provide a suitable starting point, the inclusion of more natural language processing tasks involving syntactic tree structures would be beneficial. Nevertheless, the current experiments can be considered a satisfactory initial step in demonstrating the capabilities of this new architecture.
A significant strength of the paper is the authors' systematic exploration of various design choices for the topology predictor component, including the decision-making process for termination. This thorough examination allows for a more informed understanding of the architecture's performance, rather than relying on a single, arbitrary design decision.
Given the potential of this architecture and its promising avenues for future research, I recommend accepting this manuscript as a conference contribution, recognizing its value as a foundational work with potential for future expansion and application.
