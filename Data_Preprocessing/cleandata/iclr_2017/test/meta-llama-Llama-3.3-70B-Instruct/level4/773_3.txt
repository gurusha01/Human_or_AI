This manuscript utilizes RFN for biclustering, addressing limitations in FABIA, and demonstrates superior performance compared to 14 other biclustering methods. However, from a methodological standpoint, the innovation of the proposed approach appears to be relatively minor. The authors' response to a similar concern raised by another reviewer was not entirely persuasive.
I encountered difficulties in comprehending the paper, particularly with regards to specific details. For example, in Figure 1, the construction of a bicluster matrix as the outer product of $h$ and $w$ is unclear, as the definition of $w$ is not provided. Furthermore, the estimation process for $h$ is not explicitly explained, leaving me uncertain about the biclustering methodology employed.
Overall, I have reservations regarding the suitability of this paper for publication.
Strengths:
The empirical performance of the proposed method is noteworthy.
Weaknesses:
The proposed method's novelty is limited, and certain aspects of the paper, such as specific descriptions, lack clarity.
