The manuscript appears to be technically sound, yet the experimental methodology has not fully persuaded me. An additional experiment utilizing more complex data could enhance the validity of the results. Although the motivation behind this research is not clearly articulated, it does exhibit potential, and its presentation at the conference could be of interest, warranting further consideration.
