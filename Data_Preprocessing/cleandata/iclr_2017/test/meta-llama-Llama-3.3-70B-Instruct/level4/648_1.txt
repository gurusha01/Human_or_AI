This manuscript introduces a semi-supervised approach to regularizing deep convolutional neural networks. The authors suggest an adversarial framework for image inpainting, wherein the discriminator is trained to distinguish between images from the data distribution and those generated by the model, while concurrently learning to identify objects within images from the data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with the discriminator-learned features yielding object recognition performance comparable to, or surpassing, current state-of-the-art results on two datasets. Ultimately, the proposed concept appears to be a straightforward yet effective method for regularizing CNNs, leading to enhanced classification performance.
