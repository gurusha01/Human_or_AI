This paper presents a novel framework, Neural Combinatorial Optimization, which leverages reinforcement learning and neural networks to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. The authors focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and demonstrate that their approach achieves close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs with up to 100 nodes.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) Neural Combinatorial Optimization can be used to solve TSP and other combinatorial optimization problems, (2) the approach outperforms supervised learning and traditional heuristics, and (3) it can be applied to other problems, such as the KnapSack problem.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their framework, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
The key reasons for my decision are: (1) the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to solving combinatorial optimization problems, (2) the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach, including comparisons to traditional heuristics and supervised learning, and (3) the results demonstrate the potential of Neural Combinatorial Optimization to achieve close to optimal results on large-scale problems.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their framework, including the architecture of the neural network and the hyperparameters used in the experiments. Additionally, it would be interesting to see more results on the application of Neural Combinatorial Optimization to other combinatorial optimization problems.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are: (1) How do the authors plan to extend their approach to solve larger-scale problems, (2) What are the limitations of their approach, and (3) How do the authors plan to apply their approach to real-world problems?
Overall, I believe that this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of combinatorial optimization and machine learning, and I recommend it for acceptance.
