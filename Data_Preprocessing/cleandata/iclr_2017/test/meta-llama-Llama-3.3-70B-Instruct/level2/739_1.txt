This paper presents an algorithm for polynomial feature expansion that operates directly on compressed sparse row (CSR) matrices without densification, achieving a significant improvement in time complexity. The authors claim that their algorithm has a time complexity of O(dkDk), where d is the density of the matrix, D is the dimensionality, and k is the degree of the expansion. This is a substantial improvement over the standard method, which has a time complexity of O(Dk).
I decide to accept this paper, with the primary reason being the novelty and significance of the proposed algorithm. The authors provide a clear and well-motivated explanation of the problem, and their solution is well-supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results. The paper is well-organized, and the writing is clear and concise.
The supporting arguments for my decision include the fact that the authors provide a thorough analysis of the time complexity of their algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over the standard method through empirical experiments. The paper also shows a good understanding of the relevant literature and provides a clear explanation of the underlying mathematics.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors consider providing more detailed examples of how their algorithm can be applied in practice, particularly in machine learning applications. Additionally, it would be helpful to include a more comprehensive comparison with other existing methods for polynomial feature expansion, including a discussion of the trade-offs between different approaches.
I would like to ask the authors to clarify a few points, including how their algorithm handles cases where the input matrix is not in CSR format, and whether they have considered parallelizing their algorithm to take advantage of multi-core processors. Furthermore, I would like to know more about the potential applications of this work in areas such as feature engineering and kernel methods.
Overall, this is a well-written and well-researched paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of machine learning. With some minor revisions to address the points mentioned above, it has the potential to be a highly impactful publication.
