The paper claims to contribute to the development of a computational tool to predict likely missing or incorrect medications on a patient's list, given a sequence of billing codes in their electronic medical record. The authors propose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the therapeutic classes of medications that a patient is taking, and they evaluate the performance of their model using various metrics, including micro-averaged AUC and label ranking loss.
Based on the results presented, I decide to accept this paper. The main reason for this decision is that the paper presents a well-motivated approach to a significant problem in the medical domain, and the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their model's performance. The use of RNNs is well-justified, given the sequential nature of the billing code data, and the authors provide a clear comparison with other architectures, such as feed-forward networks and random forests.
The paper provides strong support for its claims, with a thorough description of the data, methods, and results. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the performance of their model, including an evaluation of the embedding learned by the RNN. The results show that the GRU model achieves high prediction accuracy, with a micro-averaged AUC of 0.93 and a label ranking loss of 0.076.
To further improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the clinical significance of their results, and how their model could be used in practice to improve patient care. Additionally, it would be useful to see a more detailed comparison with other related work in the field, and to provide more insight into the limitations of the current approach.
Some questions that I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: How do the authors plan to address the issue of label noise in the data, which is acknowledged as a significant problem in the paper? How do the authors think their model could be integrated into existing clinical workflows, and what kind of additional data or validation would be needed to support its use in practice? What are the potential limitations of the current approach, and how might they be addressed in future work? 
Overall, the paper presents a strong contribution to the field, and with some additional clarification and detail, it has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of computational tools for improving patient care.
