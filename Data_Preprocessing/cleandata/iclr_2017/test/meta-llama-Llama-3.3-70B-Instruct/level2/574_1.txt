This paper proposes a large-scale visual search system for finding similar product images given a fashion item. The authors define over 90 fashion-related attributes and use a combination of these attributes to represent thousands of unique fashion styles. They introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize multiple fashion attributes in an end-to-end manner and build an inverted indexing scheme using these attributes. The system also extracts color and appearance features in a region-of-interest (ROI) of a fashion item for visual similarity.
I decide to accept this paper with some minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper tackles a specific and challenging problem in the e-commerce industry, and the approach is well-motivated and placed in the literature. The use of RNNs for multi-label classification and the introduction of a guided attribute-sequence generation process are novel and interesting contributions.
The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the system architecture, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a comprehensive evaluation of their system, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are some areas that need improvement. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach and a discussion of potential future work. Additionally, some of the figures and tables could be improved for better clarity and readability.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the dataset used for training and testing, including the distribution of fashion categories and attributes. They should also consider adding more quantitative results, such as precision and recall curves, to evaluate the performance of the system.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to handle the case where the user's intention is not clear or ambiguous? How do the authors evaluate the quality of the generated attributes and ROIs? Are there any plans to extend the system to handle other types of products or domains?
Overall, this is a well-written paper that presents a novel and effective approach to visual search in the e-commerce industry. With some minor revisions, it has the potential to be a strong contribution to the field.
