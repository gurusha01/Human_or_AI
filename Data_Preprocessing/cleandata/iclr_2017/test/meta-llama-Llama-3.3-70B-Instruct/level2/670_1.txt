This paper presents a novel approach for learning state representations in multi-task reinforcement learning, called Multi-Task Learning with Robotic Priors (MT-LRP). The authors propose a gated neural network architecture that learns multiple low-dimensional state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised fashion, without any knowledge of which task is executed or the number of tasks involved.
The main claims of the paper are that MT-LRP can learn better state representations for reinforcement learning and that it can identify tasks and learn task-specific state representations. The authors support these claims with simulated experiments on a multi-task slot-car racing scenario, where MT-LRP outperforms several baseline methods, including robotic priors without gated networks, principal components analysis, and raw observations.
I decide to accept this paper, with two key reasons for this choice. Firstly, the paper presents a well-motivated approach that addresses a significant problem in reinforcement learning, namely learning state representations in multi-task scenarios. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the related work and demonstrate a good understanding of the field. Secondly, the experimental results are convincing, showing that MT-LRP can learn better state representations and identify tasks with high accuracy.
The supporting arguments for these reasons are as follows. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the related work, including state representation learning, options and parameterized skills, and gated networks for mixtures of experts and submanifold learning. The authors also provide a clear and detailed description of the MT-LRP method, including the gated neural network architecture and the learning objective. The experimental results are well-presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-LRP in learning state representations and identifying tasks.
Additional feedback to improve the paper includes providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to the choice of hyperparameters. It would also be helpful to include more discussion on the potential applications of MT-LRP in real-world scenarios and the challenges that need to be addressed to deploy this method in practice.
Questions I would like answered by the authors include: How do the authors plan to extend MT-LRP to more complex scenarios with multiple tasks and high-dimensional state spaces? How do the authors plan to address the issue of task separation and consistency in more realistic scenarios where the number of tasks is unknown or large? What are the potential limitations of MT-LRP, and how do the authors plan to address them in future work?
