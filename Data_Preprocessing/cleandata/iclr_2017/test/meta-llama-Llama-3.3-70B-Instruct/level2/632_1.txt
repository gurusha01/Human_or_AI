This paper proposes a Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory access, which allows for more flexible and nuanced attention mechanisms. The authors apply this model to question answering based on knowledge bases, demonstrating its ability to handle both path queries and conjunctive queries. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide a clear explanation of their approach and its advantages over existing methods.
The main claim of the paper is that the proposed Gaussian attention model can effectively handle complex queries and provide more accurate results than existing methods. The authors support this claim with experimental results on a dataset of soccer players, showing that their model outperforms baseline methods in terms of mean filtered rank and H@1.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a novel and well-motivated approach to question answering based on knowledge bases. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of their method, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
One of the key strengths of the paper is its ability to handle complex queries, including path queries and conjunctive queries. The authors demonstrate that their model can effectively propagate uncertainty when composing relations together, which is a key challenge in question answering. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the results, including an evaluation of the model's performance on different types of queries.
To further improve the paper, I would suggest that the authors provide more details on the implementation of their model, including the specific architectures and hyperparameters used. Additionally, it would be helpful to see more comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly those that have been specifically designed for question answering based on knowledge bases.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer include: How do the authors plan to extend their model to handle more complex queries, such as those involving multiple entities and relations? How do the authors plan to incorporate additional knowledge sources, such as text or images, into their model? What are the potential applications of the proposed Gaussian attention model beyond question answering based on knowledge bases?
Overall, I believe that this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of question answering based on knowledge bases, and I look forward to seeing further developments and applications of the proposed Gaussian attention model.
