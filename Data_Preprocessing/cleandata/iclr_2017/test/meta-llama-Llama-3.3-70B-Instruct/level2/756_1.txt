This paper introduces two novel neural network architectures, similarity encoders (SimEcs) and context encoders (ConEcs), which learn similarity-preserving representations of data. The authors claim that SimEcs can retain arbitrary pairwise relations present in the input space, even those obtained from unknown similarity functions, and that ConEcs can improve word embeddings by using local context information.
I decide to accept this paper with minor revisions. The main reason for this decision is that the paper presents a well-motivated and well-executed approach to learning similarity-preserving representations, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the proposed architectures, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
The supporting arguments for this decision are as follows. First, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear structure and concise explanations. Second, the proposed architectures are well-motivated and grounded in existing research, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the relationships between SimEcs, ConEcs, and other existing methods. Third, the experimental results are convincing and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in various tasks, including dimensionality reduction and word embedding.
To further improve the paper, I suggest the following revisions. First, the authors could provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process and the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. Second, the authors could discuss the potential applications of SimEcs and ConEcs in more detail, and provide more examples of how these architectures could be used in practice. Third, the authors could consider adding more related work to the paper, particularly in the area of word embeddings and natural language processing.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer are: How do the authors plan to extend the proposed architectures to more complex data types, such as images or videos? How do the authors plan to address the issue of overfitting in SimEcs and ConEcs, particularly when dealing with large datasets? What are the potential limitations of the proposed architectures, and how do the authors plan to address these limitations in future work?
