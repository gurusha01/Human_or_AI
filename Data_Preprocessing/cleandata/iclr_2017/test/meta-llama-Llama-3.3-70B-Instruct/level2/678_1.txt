This paper explores the possibility of using transfer learning to improve the performance of neural-network-based models on text comprehension tasks, particularly in domains where training data is scarce. The authors investigate whether pre-training models on large-scale datasets, such as BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, can improve their performance on target tasks, including bAbI and SQuAD.
The main claims of the paper are: (1) pre-training on large-scale datasets can improve the performance of models on target tasks, even when the target task has limited training data; (2) the benefits of pre-training are not limited to word embeddings, but also extend to the encoder parameters; and (3) pre-training can help models generalize to new tasks, even if the tasks are quite different from the pre-training task.
The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach, including experiments on multiple tasks and datasets. The results show that pre-training on large-scale datasets can indeed improve the performance of models on target tasks, especially when the target task has limited training data. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the benefits of pre-training, including the importance of both word embeddings and encoder parameters.
I decide to accept this paper because it presents a well-motivated and well-executed study on the use of transfer learning for text comprehension tasks. The paper provides a clear and concise introduction to the problem, a thorough review of related work, and a detailed description of the proposed approach. The experimental results are convincing, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.
One potential limitation of the paper is that the authors do not provide a direct comparison with state-of-the-art models on the target tasks. While the authors do provide some comparisons with other models, a more thorough comparison with the current state of the art would strengthen the paper.
To improve the paper, I suggest that the authors provide more details on the hyperparameter tuning process, as well as a more detailed analysis of the results on each task. Additionally, the authors could consider providing more insights into the types of tasks that are most suitable for transfer learning, and how to select the most effective pre-training datasets.
Some questions I would like the authors to answer to clarify my understanding of the paper include: (1) How did the authors select the hyperparameters for the pre-trained models, and what was the effect of hyperparameter tuning on the results? (2) Can the authors provide more insights into the types of tasks that are most suitable for transfer learning, and how to select the most effective pre-training datasets? (3) How do the authors plan to extend this work to other NLP tasks, and what are the potential limitations of the proposed approach?
