The paper presents a straightforward and well-justified algorithm for graph node prediction/classification. The proposed formulations are intuitive, resulting in a simple CNN-based training framework that can effectively utilize existing GPU optimizations.
The experimental evaluation is comprehensive, comparing the method against numerous relevant baselines on large, real-world benchmark datasets. While I am not deeply familiar with the broader literature on alternative methods, given that link and node prediction is a longstanding problem, there may exist similar approaches. Nevertheless, I find the proposed method to be both simple and adequately validated through strong empirical results.
