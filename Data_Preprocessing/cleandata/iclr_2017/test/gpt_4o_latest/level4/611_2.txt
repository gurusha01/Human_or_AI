This paper presents a minor enhancement to DeepRS, with the primary contribution being the incorporation of user-item factor coupling in the prediction process. While the motivation for this approach is well-articulated, the architectural improvements introduced by the model are relatively modest.  
I recommend that the authors strengthen the paper by providing a more in-depth discussion on the impact of introducing coupling, which could enhance the paper's contribution. Specifically, the authors should conduct isolated experiments that incrementally modify the loss function and architecture, transitioning from a non-coupled network to the final proposed coupled network. This would better highlight the significance of the coupling mechanism.  
Another critical omission in the paper is the lack of discussion on time complexity. Since a coupled network is likely to be more computationally expensive for generating recommendations, the authors should address how this increased cost might affect real-world applications.  
In summary, I believe this paper requires further improvements before it can be considered for acceptance.
