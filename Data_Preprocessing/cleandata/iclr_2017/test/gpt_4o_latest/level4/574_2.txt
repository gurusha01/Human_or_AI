This paper presents a practical large-scale visual search system tailored for a fashion website. It employs an RNN for multi-label attribute recognition and leverages the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN to extract features from regions of interest (ROIs). However, the technical contribution of this work is unclear. The methods utilized are largely standard state-of-the-art techniques, and the novelty in their application is limited. For the multi-label recognition task, alternative approaches exist, such as using binary models or modifying the cross-entropy loss function. Additionally, the paper does not provide comparisons between the proposed RNN method and other simpler baselines. The rationale behind the sequential order of RNN predictions is also ambiguous. It appears that the attributes are organized in a tree hierarchy, which is used to determine the sequence order.
The paper is also not well-written. Most of the results are based on an internal dataset, which the authors do not intend to release.
