This paper introduces a semi-supervised method for regularizing deep convolutional neural networks.  
The authors propose an adversarial framework for image inpainting, where the discriminator is trained to distinguish whether an inpainted image originates from the data distribution or the generator, while simultaneously learning to identify objects in images from the data distribution. Through experiments, they demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, showing that the features learned by the discriminator achieve comparable or superior object recognition performance compared to the current state-of-the-art on two datasets.  
In summary, the proposed method appears to be a straightforward yet effective strategy for regularizing CNNs to enhance classification performance.
