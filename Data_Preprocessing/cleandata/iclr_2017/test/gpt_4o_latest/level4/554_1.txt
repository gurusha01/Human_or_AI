This paper integrates DRQN with eligibility traces and explores the use of the Adam optimizer for training the Q-network. The research direction is promising, and the experiments highlight the advantages of incorporating eligibility traces and Adam on two Atari games. However, the methods themselves lack novelty. Consequently, the main contributions of the paper are (1) the application of eligibility traces and Adam to DRQN and (2) the experimental evaluation. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
The experiments include both quantitative results and qualitative insights into the methods' performance and underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, the evaluation is limited to only two Atari games, making it challenging to assess the method's broader applicability. Including results from additional games and/or other domains would greatly enhance the paper. Additionally, presenting error bars based on multiple random seeds would further strengthen the experimental analysis.
