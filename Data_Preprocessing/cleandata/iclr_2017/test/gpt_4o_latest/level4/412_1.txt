This paper introduces a novel layer-wise optimization method for training CNNs with piecewise linear nonlinearities. The proposed method trains piecewise linear CNNs in a layer-by-layer manner and reformulates the sub-problem as a latent structured SVM, a framework that is well-established in the literature. Additionally, the paper incorporates enhancements to the BCFW algorithm employed in the inner optimization procedure. Overall, the paper is engaging; however, the experimental results are not convincing.
Pros:
- To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method is novel, and the authors provide solid theoretical analysis to support their approach.  
- The paper is well-structured and written in a clear and accessible manner.
Cons:
- While the proposed method is applicable to general structured prediction problems, the experiments are limited to a simple multi-class classification task, which diminishes the overall impact and generalizability of the work.  
- The reported test accuracy on CIFAR-10 appears questionable. The best model achieves an accuracy of 70.2%, whereas existing methods typically report results exceeding 90%. For instance,
