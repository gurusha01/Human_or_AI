This study introduces a straightforward yet effective baseline for parametric texture synthesis. Through empirical evaluations, the samples generated using the proposed baseline, which employs multi-scale and random filters, occasionally rival those produced by the VGG-based model that utilizes multi-layer, pre-trained filters. The authors suggest that texture synthesis may not inherently require deep hierarchical representations or learned feature maps.
The work is both intriguing and thought-provoking. However, the conclusions require further validation, particularly regarding the role of deep hierarchical representations. First, the samples generated by both the VGG-based model and the single-layer model are imperfect and significantly inferior to those produced by non-parametric methods. Additionally, the VGG-based model appears to perform better in the inpainting task, as shown in Figure 7. Finally, could a hierarchical model (as opposed to numerous filters of varying sizes) provide a more efficient approach to handling multi-scale features?
