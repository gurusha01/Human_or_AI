I acknowledge the effort put into this work, but I find the clarity of the paper lacking.  
Additionally, the authors use the term "local minima" approximately 70 times but, aside from Figure 11 (perhaps), do not provide evidence that the solutions obtained are indeed not local minima.  
The authors also fail to address the fact that cross-sections of a non-convex problem can resemble the examples they present.  
It is widely recognized that first-order methods can struggle with certain non-convex, ill-conditioned problems, even in low-dimensional, noiseless scenarios. However, the points or solutions where these methods fail to progress are not necessarily local minima.  
Furthermore, sentences like the one below give the impression that the analysis lacks depth:  
"One of the interesting empirical observations is that we often observe that the incremental improvement of optimization methods decreases rapidly even in non-convex problems."
