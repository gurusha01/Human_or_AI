The authors have categorized recent advancements in convolutional neural network (CNN) design, particularly in the context of image classification, to extract key design principles that broadly guide the field. They identify 14 principles, each accompanied by relevant references, which include several insightful and accurate observations that could serve as a valuable resource for those new to the domain. The authors also evaluate a range of architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, using these principles as a foundation.
The paper assembles a well-curated and organized set of references, which is particularly beneficial for early-career researchers. The authors have clearly conducted extensive experimentation involving various architectural modifications, and the availability of a public codebase is a commendable contribution.
However, the manuscript's organization feels somewhat disjointed, and the rationale behind certain design principles is not always clearly articulated. For instance, "Design Pattern 4: Increase Symmetry," which advocates for architectural symmetry as a marker of beauty and quality, is presented as one of the 14 principles without sufficient justification. Similarly, "Design Pattern 6: Over-train," which refers to training on more challenging problems to enhance generalization during inference, is introduced in the middle of a paragraph without supporting references or further elaboration.
The experimental section appears fragmented, with numerous approaches tested based on subsets of the proposed design principles. These approaches predominantly involve either minor modifications to existing networks (e.g., variations in FractalNet pooling strategies) or novel architectures that fail to deliver significant performance improvements. The notable exception is the Fractal-of-Fractal network, which achieves marginally better accuracy but at the cost of substantially increasing the number of parameters (and hence capacity) compared to the original FractalNet.
Preliminary rating:  
While the effort to synthesize and distill research into overarching patterns is commendable, some of the identified principles lack sufficient development and explanation. Moreover, the novel architectures inspired by these principles either underperform or achieve modest gains by significantly increasing model complexity (e.g., Fractal-of-Fractal networks). For a paper focused on high-level design trends, I would expect more rigorous experimentation and validation of each principle rather than primarily introducing new architectures.
