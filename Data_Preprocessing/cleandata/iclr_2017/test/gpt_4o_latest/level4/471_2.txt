The authors propose employing an off-policy actor-critic algorithm within a batch setting to enhance chat-bots.  
The methodology is well-justified, and the paper is clearly written, though additional insights into why the batch setting outperforms the online setting would be beneficial (refer to comments under "clarification regarding batch vs. online setting").  
The synthetic experiments are illustrative, and the real-world experiments are conducted with great rigor, although the observed improvements are relatively modest.
