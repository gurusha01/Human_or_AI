This paper extends prior work on using embeddings for modeling Knowledge Bases and performing Question Answering (Q&A) on them, with a focus on employing multivariate Gaussian likelihoods instead of inner products for scoring attention. The proposed approach aims to provide greater control over attention by addressing its spread.
The paper is dense and revolves around a fairly complex model. Including the supplementary material, it spans 16 pages. It might be more effective to split this work into two separate papers: one focused on Knowledge Base (KB) completion and the other on Q&A.
The idea of controlling attention spread is interesting and conceptually sound. However, I do not find the paper sufficiently convincing to demonstrate that this approach offers clear advantages over traditional inner product methods.
Here are my main concerns:
- There is a need for more ablation studies to disentangle the contributions of different components of the model and analyze their individual impacts. The only relevant analysis in this regard is Table 8 in Appendix B, but this is insufficient. More such experiments are necessary.
- A direct comparison between Gaussian interaction and inner product in a canonical setting would be particularly valuable.
- While I appreciate the authors' effort to propose a new benchmark (WorldCup2014), experiments on established benchmarks for KB completion or Q&A are still essential. The new benchmark should complement, rather than replace, evaluations on existing datasets.
- Table 11 in Appendix C (page 16), which compares TransE and TransGaussian for link prediction on WordNet, partially addresses the above points by providing a simpler setting on an established benchmark. However, the results are not favorable for TransGaussian, as it underperforms compared to the simpler TransE. Similarly, the poor performance of TransGaussian (SINGLE) in Table 2 highlights the challenges in training this architecture effectively, raising questions about its practical validity.
