The paper explores the adaptation of rectified factor networks, previously introduced by the same authors, for the task of biclustering. While the method shows potential, the paper suffers from significant issues in its presentation.
Quality:
The proposed approach is largely built upon techniques detailed in a NIPS 2015 paper authored by (primarily) the same researchers. The experimental methodology requires further clarification. In particular, the results—most notably those in Table 2—appear to hinge heavily on the sparsity of the identified clusters. However, the authors fail to provide sufficient detail on how the sparsity hyperparameter is selected.
Clarity:
The writing style is highly problematic and falls far short of the standards expected in a scientific publication. The text reads more like an industry white paper or promotional material rather than an impartial scientific study. A complete rewrite is necessary before the paper can be considered for publication. Specifically, all mentions of companies employing the proposed methods should be removed.
Moreover, Table 1 is nearly illegible. It would be better presented as a figure or significantly cleaned up by eliminating engineering notation and reporting values per 1000. For instance, "0.475 ± 9e-4" could be reformatted as "475 ± 0.9". In general, figures should be prioritized for presenting results in the main text, with tables relegated to supplementary materials.
Originality:
The work offers limited novelty, as the method is largely derived from the authors' NIPS 2015 paper. While the experimental evaluation introduces some new elements, certain aspects—such as the IBD detection—bear a strong resemblance to Hochreiter (2013) without any direct comparison.
Significance:
The primary claim of the paper relies on strong empirical performance in benchmarks designed by the authors. However, the practical utility of the method for others is questionable due to the lack of publicly available code and incomplete implementation details. Additionally, the method depends on numerous tuning parameters, yet the paper does not adequately define how these parameters should be tuned, raising concerns about the generalizability of the reported performance.
