The paper introduces a large-scale visual search system designed to locate product images corresponding to a given fashion item. The exploration is engaging, and the paper effectively highlights the challenges inherent to this domain. The proposed approach tackles several of these challenges.
Nonetheless, there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1) A primary concern is the lack of discussion or comparison with prior work from Tamara Berg's group on fashion recognition and fashion attributes, such as:  
   - "Automatic Attribute Discovery and Characterization from Noisy Web Data," ECCV 2010  
   - "Where to Buy It: Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops," ICCV 2015  
   - "Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing," TPAMI 2014  
   Without referencing and comparing to this extensive body of prior work, it is difficult to assess the contribution and novelty of the proposed approach.
2) The paper provides insufficient details about the attribute dataset and its collection process. Specifically, what is the source of the images? Are these clean product images or real-world images? How were the annotations generated? What instructions were provided to annotators? What specific annotations were collected? While proprietary data statistics may not be required, these qualitative details are crucial for understanding the contributions of the work and enabling others to benchmark against it.
3) Some important baselines are missing. For instance, how do the results in Table 2 compare to simpler methods, such as the BM or CM methods mentioned in the text?
While the paper offers an intriguing exploration, these concerns must be addressed before it can be considered ready for publication.
