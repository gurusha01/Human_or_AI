This paper is well-written, well-organized, and thoughtfully presented, making it an enjoyable read. I commend the authors for their careful attention to the narrative and the clarity of their explanations. While the work does not introduce a novel methodology or architecture, it tackles an important application: predicting the medications a patient is using based on their billing code records. The dataset employed is both impressive and valuable, offering a refreshing departure from the commonly used toy datasets in machine learning. However, I found the depth of the empirical investigation to be somewhat lacking for a paper focused on applications. That said, I appreciated the authors' use of modern tools and techniques (e.g., Keras, adadelta) in their architecture, which reflects a commitment to leveraging cutting-edge approaches. Below are some points of constructive criticism:
- The numerical results section feels too brief. Figure 4 is anecdotal, while Figure 5 essentially highlights a negative result (tSNE is only interpretable in certain regions), leaving Table 1 as the primary source of empirical evidence. Given that the paper does not propose significant algorithmic or theoretical innovations, I had expected a more extensive and detailed analysis of the results. To clarify, I do not view this as a major flaw or a disqualifying issue, but it did leave me somewhat underwhelmed.
- As a suggestion for improvement, I recommend removing Figure 5 and replacing it with a more meaningful analysis of the model's performance. Figure 5, in its current form, is largely uninformative and could be summarized in a single sentence as a negative result, rather than occupying space as a large figure.
- The paper includes some jargon and assumes a level of expertise that may not be familiar to the typical ICLR audience. Another reviewer suggested that this work might be better suited for a medical or healthcare-focused venue. While I understand their perspective, I would advocate for keeping this paper within the ICLR community, as thoughtful and in-depth applications like this enrich our field. To address this concern, I recommend reducing the reliance on domain-specific jargon and presenting the results in a way that allows ICLR readers without medical expertise to critically evaluate the findings. Currently, readers without a healthcare background must take the results in Table 1 at face value, rather than being able to apply their quantitative expertise to assess the outcomes.
In summary, this is a strong and valuable paper.
