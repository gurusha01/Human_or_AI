Apologies for the delayed review—I encountered technical difficulties with OpenReview that prevented me from submitting earlier.
This paper introduces a method for predicting outcomes from sets of data points. The approach extends the VAE framework hierarchically, with the top layer incorporating an abstract context unit that encapsulates a dataset's summary. The experiments demonstrate that the method effectively "learns to learn," acquiring the capability to infer distributions from a limited number of examples.
In general, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of one- or few-shot learning. The proposed method is both conceptually straightforward and elegant, while also delivering strong performance. Compared to other recent works on one-shot learning, this approach is simpler and leverages unsupervised representation learning. The paper is well-written and enjoyable to read.
However, the title of the paper feels overly ambitious relative to the actual scope of the work. The proposed method doesn't seem to align closely with the role of a statistician, unless the term is interpreted loosely as "someone who devises statistics."
The experiments are thoughtfully designed, and the few-shot learning results appear robust, especially given the simplicity of the approach.
The spatial MNIST dataset is an intriguing addition and could serve as a useful toy benchmark. That said, the inputs in Figure 4 seem quite dense—shouldn't the method be capable of identifying the distribution with fewer samples? (Minor note: the red points in Figure 4 don't appear to correspond to meaningful points as described in the text.)
Lastly, will the authors make the code publicly available?
