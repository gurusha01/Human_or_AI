The authors propose a novel algorithm for efficiently computing polynomial features on Sparse Matrices. The core concept involves establishing an appropriate mapping between matrices and their polynomial representations to develop an efficient CSR expansion algorithm. The authors provide a compelling analysis of the time complexity, supported by experimental results.
In general, the algorithm is intriguing, relatively straightforward, and elegant, with potential for numerous applications. However, the paper lacks depth in its experimental evaluation and the exploration of practical applications for the proposed method. More critically, the relevance of this work to the primary focus of ICLR is unclear, and it may be better suited for submission to a more appropriate venue.
