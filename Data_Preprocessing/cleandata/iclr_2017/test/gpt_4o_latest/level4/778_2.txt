I would like to see the results presented in a clear and concise table, showing both the original results and the results after applying compression across all tasks. Additionally, it is important to include results when compression is applied to state-of-the-art networks where the float representation plays a critical role. For example, a network achieving 0.5%–0.8% error on MNIST or less than 5%–10% error on ImageNet. While some of these results may be achievable with float representations, they are likely unattainable with restricted representations.
