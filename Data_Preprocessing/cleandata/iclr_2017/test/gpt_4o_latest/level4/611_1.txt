The authors present a method for learning user and item embeddings through the application of a deep neural network for recommendation tasks. However, the proposed approach exhibits only slight variations from the previously established CDL, which also employs neural networks for similar purposes. In the experimental evaluation, the proposed method, DualNets, utilizes a greater number of item features compared to WMF and CDL, rendering the comparisons inequitable.
