This paper introduces a method to integrate super-resolution and inpainting into the GAN framework for semi-supervised learning by leveraging the discriminative features of GANs on larger images.
While the central concept of the paper lacks significant novelty, as the utility of GAN discriminative features for semi-supervised learning has been well-established in prior works like CatGAN, DCGAN, and Salimans et al., the authors have successfully demonstrated the application of the semi-supervised GAN framework on larger datasets such as STL-10 and Pascal. By employing the proposed context conditioning approach, the paper achieves state-of-the-art results on these datasets.
The authors should consider including the SSL-GAN baseline for the PASCAL dataset, as it is crucial to evaluate the contribution of the context conditioning approach against the standard use of GANs for semi-supervised learning, namely SSL-GAN. It is unclear why SSL-GAN cannot be applied to the 64×64 and 96×96 versions of the Pascal dataset (Table 3). If the authors encountered difficulties training the vanilla GAN on Pascal, even at the 64×64 resolution, this should be explicitly mentioned and explained in the paper. This point is particularly important because CC-GAN performs nearly on par with the SSL-GAN baseline on STL-10, and CC-GAN2 appears to be a somewhat ad hoc extension of the core CC-GAN idea. Therefore, it would be valuable to compare CC-GAN and SSL-GAN on another dataset, even if it involves a downsampled version of the PASCAL dataset.
