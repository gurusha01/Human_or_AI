This paper delivers a comprehensive analysis of the error loss function across various optimization methods. The presentation is clear and informative, and the experimental procedure is explained with sufficient detail. Theoretical studies of this nature are essential for numerous applications, as they contribute to a deeper understanding of and improvements in the convergence behavior of systems.
Strengths:
- Significant and valuable analysis  
- Effective visualizations  
Weaknesses:
- The paper primarily focuses on observing that the optima differ across methods but does not delve into explaining the underlying reasons or proposing solutions (other than batch normalization).  
- Certain fonts are excessively small (e.g., Figure 5).
