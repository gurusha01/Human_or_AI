This study is well-executed and clearly articulated, focusing on the prediction of medications from diagnostic codes. The authors evaluated GRUs, LSTMs, feed-forward networks, and random forests (providing justification for favoring random forests over SVMs) and conducted an analysis of both the predictions and the embeddings.
Additionally, the authors have adequately addressed the reviewers' questions.
My sole critique is that this work may be better suited for a data science or medical-focused venue rather than ICLR.
