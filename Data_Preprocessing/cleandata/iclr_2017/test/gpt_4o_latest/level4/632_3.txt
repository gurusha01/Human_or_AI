SUMMARY  
The paper introduces a novel scoring function for knowledge base embedding.  
The scoring function, named TransGaussian, represents an innovative approach (or a generalization) of the widely recognized TransE scoring function.  
The proposed method is evaluated on two tasks: knowledge base completion and question answering.  
OVERALL JUDGMENT  
While I find the proposed work to be intriguing and believe it is an idea worth further exploration, the paper has some issues in terms of its presentation and experimental evaluation.  
In terms of presentation, it appears that this is not an attention model in the conventional sense as understood in the literature.  
Moreover, the connection drawn to memory networks or neural Turing machines is weak and unconvincing.  
Regarding the experimental evaluation, the authors should ensure fair comparisons by testing their model on standard benchmarks and reporting results against state-of-the-art models.  
Lastly, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the results and insights into the behavior of the proposed model.  
DETAILED COMMENTS  
In Section 2.2, when the authors compute \mu_{context}, do they not lose the order of relations? If so, does this approach still make sense?
