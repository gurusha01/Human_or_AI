The paper introduces an active learning method that selects mini-batches for deep learning using an approximation of the Bayesian posterior, with several terms being approximated in the process.
The Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Bayesian inference approach to active learning, along with the associated approximations and the broader theoretical framework, is intriguing but challenging to comprehend.
The manuscript is poorly written in terms of English, making it occasionally difficult to read.
While alternative active learning methods and techniques are described in excessive detail, the proposed approach, which involves numerous complex approximations, would benefit from a more structured and detailed explanation. Additionally, including another dataset would strengthen the work, as the current datasets (gray digits and USPS) are relatively similar in nature.
