This paper introduces a compare-aggregate framework that conducts word-level matching, followed by aggregation using convolutional neural networks. It explores six distinct comparison functions and evaluates their performance across four datasets. Comprehensive experimental results are presented and benchmarked against multiple established baselines.
The paper is generally well-written.
Some specific comments:
* Page 4, line 5: "including a some" â†’ "including some"
* What advantages do the preprocessing and attention steps offer? Could you include results without these steps for comparison?
* Figure 2 is difficult to interpret, particularly in printed hard copy. Consider improving its quality for better readability.
