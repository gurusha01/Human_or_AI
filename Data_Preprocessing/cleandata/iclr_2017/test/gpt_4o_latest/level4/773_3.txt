This paper utilizes RFN for biclustering as a means to address the limitations of FABIA. The proposed approach achieves the best performance among 14 biclustering methods. However, my primary concern lies in the limited methodological novelty of the proposed approach. While the authors addressed a similar concern raised by another reviewer, their responses were not particularly convincing. 
I also found this paper challenging to follow. For example, in Figure 1, a bicluster matrix is constructed as an outer product of $h$ and $w$. While $h$ is described as a hidden unit, the definition of $w$ is missing. Additionally, it is unclear how $h$ is estimated in this method. As a result, I do not fully understand the process by which this method performs biclustering.
Overall, I am uncertain whether this paper is suitable for publication.
Pros:
- Strong empirical performance.
Cons:
- Limited methodological novelty.
- Some descriptions in the paper lack clarity.
