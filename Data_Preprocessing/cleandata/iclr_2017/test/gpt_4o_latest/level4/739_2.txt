This paper introduces an algorithm for polynomial feature expansion on CSR matrices, which achieves a reduction in the time complexity of the standard method by a factor of d^k, where d represents the density of the sparse matrix. However, the primary contribution of this work lacks sufficient significance. Additionally, the experimental evaluation is incomplete and unconvincing.
The manuscript does not adequately introduce the background of the problem. The introduction section cites only two references (and only three papers in total), all of which are from several decades ago. The authors should include citations to more recent and relevant literature to provide a comprehensive context.
The experimental section is particularly weak. While the paper asserts that the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(d^k D^k), offering an improvement over the standard method's O(D^k) by a factor of d^k, the experimental results are inconsistent with this claim. Specifically, when d=1, there remains a significant performance gap (~14s vs. ~90s) between the proposed method and the standard approach. The authors attribute this discrepancy to "likely a language implementation," which is not a convincing explanation. For a fair comparison, both methods should be implemented in the same programming language and tested under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the paper does not provide empirical results demonstrating the benefits of the proposed method for higher-degree feature expansions.
Several minor issues are noted:
1) In Section 2, the notation "pi:pi+1" is not clearly defined.
2) In Section 3.1, there is a typo: "efter" should be corrected to "after."
3) None of the algorithms in the paper have titles, and the input and output are not explicitly stated.
4) In Figure 1, the meaning of the colored areas is not explained. Are these standard deviations or quantiles of the running time? Additionally, the number of runs used to generate the ribbons is not specified. Many details regarding the experimental setup are missing.
