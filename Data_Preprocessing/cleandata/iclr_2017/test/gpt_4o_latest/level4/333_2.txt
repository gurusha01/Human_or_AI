This paper presents a compelling analysis of the conditions that facilitate the creation of natural-looking textures. The findings are quite unexpected, and the analysis is detailed and comprehensive. While I believe the evaluation methods could be improved, as noted by other reviewers, this represents a promising direction for future research and does not significantly detract from the current work. Overall, I believe this paper merits acceptance.
