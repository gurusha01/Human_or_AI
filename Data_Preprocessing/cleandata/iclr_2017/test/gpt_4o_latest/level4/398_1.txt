The authors of this paper aim to address the question of whether chaotic behavior is essential for RNNs to achieve strong performance on certain tasks. To investigate this, they introduce an architecture explicitly designed to avoid chaos. Their subsequent experiments support the conclusion that chaos is not a prerequisite for success.
This work is a breath of fresh air. Rather than presenting yet another incremental advancement, the authors begin with a well-defined hypothesis and rigorously test it. This approach has the potential to lay the groundwork for future RNN design principles.
However, a limitation of the study is that the experiments are restricted to tasks that are relatively undemanding from a dynamical systems perspective. It would have been more compelling if the authors had explored a broader range of datasets, particularly those where chaotic dynamics might play a critical role.
