This paper explores the energy-based model (EBM) perspective of GANs, where the discriminator serves as an unnormalized model for the likelihood of the generative model \( p(x|\theta) \), and the generator is a directed model that approximates this distribution. The generator produces approximate negative phase samples, which are then used in stochastic maximum likelihood or contrastive divergence training of the EBM/discriminator.
The core contribution of the paper is the proposal to optimize the generator using the Stein variational gradient. In practice, this gradient comprises the standard gradient provided by the discriminator, augmented with an additional term that introduces a repulsive force between sampled data points to enhance sample diversity.
The concept of employing a kernel to separate sampled points is intriguing and may work effectively in low-dimensional settings. However, its applicability to high-dimensional data, such as full-scale images, is questionable. For high-dimensional samples \( x \), the proposed kernel is unlikely to serve as a meaningful distance metric between points. The paper does not provide compelling experimental evidence to address this concern. Specifically:
- The paper lacks an experiment comparing standard GANs and GANs with the proposed repulsion term, using identical architectures. (This should be addressed in the rebuttal.)
- If the Stein variational framework is followed rigorously, the generator should ideally be fully optimized at each step before taking a single optimization step on the discriminator. Instead, the paper alternates updates between the generator and discriminator, with learning rates adjusted to maintain balance between the two.
- The kernel used to optimize the generator is defined in the auto-encoder space of the discriminator, making it dependent on the discriminator's parameters. Consequently, the generator's objective function changes at every step, and the procedure can no longer be interpreted as stochastic gradient descent on a single, well-defined objective.
The authors achieve promising results: the generated images are visibly superior to those produced by DCGAN. However, the proposed approach introduces several modifications compared to DCGAN, making it unclear which specific change drives the improvement. Furthermore, DCGAN is no longer a strong baseline, as numerous more advanced techniques have since been developed.
Note: The use of \( \phi \) to denote both the "particle gradient direction" and the energy function is confusing and should be clarified.
