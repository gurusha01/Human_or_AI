Review of "Collaborative Deep Embedding"
Summary of the Paper
The authors propose a novel method, Collaborative Deep Embedding (DualNets), for learning user and item embeddings to improve recommendation tasks. The method employs dual deep neural networks to encode users and items, trained collaboratively to predict user-item interactions. The authors claim that this approach addresses key challenges in recommender systems, such as cold-start issues and the semantic gap between user preferences and item features. They further argue that their multi-level branching network design enhances expressive power and generalization. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DualNets outperform state-of-the-art methods, including Weighted Matrix Factorization (WMF) and Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL), particularly in handling unseen items and users.
Decision: Reject
While the paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to recommendation tasks, it fails to provide sufficient novelty and rigor to justify acceptance. The primary reasons for rejection are:  
1. Limited Novelty: DualNets exhibit only minor differences from the CDL approach, which already integrates deep learning for item encoding and collaborative filtering. The key innovation—dual networks for user and item encoding—is incremental and not sufficiently differentiated from prior work.  
2. Unfair Comparisons: The experimental evaluation is flawed because DualNets leverage additional item features that are not utilized by WMF and CDL, making the comparisons unfair and the claimed performance gains less credible.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Novelty: While the authors emphasize the dual-network architecture and multi-level branching design, these contributions are incremental extensions of CDL. The claim that the method generalizes better to unseen items and users is not convincingly substantiated as CDL also addresses the cold-start problem by incorporating item features. The novelty is further diminished by the lack of theoretical insights or significant architectural innovations beyond the multi-level branching design.  
2. Experimental Weaknesses: The authors compare DualNets against WMF and CDL but fail to ensure a fair evaluation. DualNets utilize additional item features (e.g., visual features for MovieLens) that are not available to the baselines. This advantage skews the results, making it difficult to attribute performance improvements solely to the proposed method. Additionally, the datasets used for evaluation are relatively sparse, raising concerns about the robustness of the results.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Novelty: The authors should explicitly highlight how DualNets differ fundamentally from CDL and other hybrid methods. A deeper theoretical analysis or ablation studies isolating the impact of the dual-network design would strengthen the contribution.  
2. Ensure Fair Comparisons: The experimental setup should be revised to ensure that all methods have access to the same features. If additional item features are used, their impact should be isolated through controlled experiments.  
3. Broader Evaluation: The authors should evaluate DualNets on more diverse datasets, including those with higher density and different types of user-item interactions, to demonstrate robustness.  
4. Explain Multi-Level Branching: While the multi-level branching design is claimed to improve performance, the paper lacks sufficient explanation and analysis of why this design is effective. A detailed ablation study comparing the basic, multi-level, and branching designs would be beneficial.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method handle scenarios where item features are unavailable or irrelevant?  
2. Can the authors provide a detailed comparison of the computational complexity of DualNets versus CDL?  
3. How would the performance of DualNets change if the additional item features (e.g., visual features) were removed?  
In conclusion, while the paper addresses an important problem in recommender systems, the limited novelty and unfair experimental comparisons undermine its contributions. Addressing these issues could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
