The paper investigates the use of eligibility traces with recurrent deep Q-networks (DRQN) in reinforcement learning, leveraging the forward view of Sutton and Barto for practical implementation. It claims that eligibility traces accelerate and stabilize learning, particularly in environments with sparse rewards and delayed credit assignment. The authors present experimental results on two Atari games, Pong and Tennis, demonstrating that eligibility traces outperform standard Q-learning and highlight the influence of optimization methods like Adam and RMSprop. The paper contributes to an underexplored area in deep reinforcement learning by combining eligibility traces with recurrent architectures and analyzing their interaction with optimizers.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the limited scope of experiments and the lack of comparisons with alternative methods like n-step returns, which are well-established in reinforcement learning literature. Additionally, the claims about optimization effects are inconclusive due to the restricted experimental setup, which involves only two games and fixed hyperparameters.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments are conducted on only two Atari games, Pong and Tennis, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. While the results are promising, the contribution is relatively minor compared to existing methods like n-step Q-learning, which have been validated across a broader range of environments.
   
2. Lack of Comparative Analysis: The paper does not compare eligibility traces with n-step returns, a closely related method that has shown significant improvements in both classical and deep reinforcement learning. This omission makes it difficult to assess the novelty and practical utility of the proposed approach.
3. Inconclusive Claims on Optimization: The paper highlights the impact of optimizers like Adam and RMSprop but does not perform hyperparameter tuning or explore variations in optimizer settings. This limits the ability to substantiate claims about the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Broader Experimental Validation: Extend the experiments to include a wider variety of Atari games or other benchmark environments to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach.
2. Comparative Analysis: Include comparisons with n-step returns and other relevant methods to contextualize the contribution of eligibility traces in the broader landscape of reinforcement learning.
3. Hyperparameter Exploration: Conduct experiments with different hyperparameter settings, such as varying the frozen network update frequency or the size of the experience replay buffer, to provide more robust conclusions about optimization effects.
4. Ablation Studies: Perform ablation studies to isolate the contributions of eligibility traces and recurrent architectures, as well as their interaction with optimizers.
Questions for the Authors:
1. Why were n-step returns not included as a baseline for comparison, given their relevance to eligibility traces?
2. How do you justify the generalizability of your findings based on experiments with only two games?
3. Did you explore the impact of varying Î» values or the trace cutoff threshold on performance?
4. Could the observed benefits of Adam be attributed to specific hyperparameter choices rather than the optimizer itself?
While the paper addresses an interesting and underexplored area, the limited scope and lack of rigorous comparisons prevent it from making a substantial contribution to the field. Addressing these limitations could significantly strengthen the work.
