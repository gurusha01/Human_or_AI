Review of "Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning"
Summary of Contributions
This paper introduces a novel framework, Neural Combinatorial Optimization, for solving combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and reinforcement learning (RL). The authors focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and demonstrate the utility of a pointer network architecture with attention mechanisms to predict city permutations. The network is trained using an actor-critic RL approach, where the actor employs the REINFORCE algorithm and the critic estimates a reward baseline. The framework is extended to other problems like the Knapsack problem, showcasing its flexibility. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal solutions for 2D Euclidean TSP with up to 100 nodes and optimal solutions for Knapsack instances with up to 200 items. While the approach does not outperform state-of-the-art solvers, it provides a generalizable and heuristic-free alternative to traditional methods.
Decision: Accept
The paper presents a novel and promising approach to tackling combinatorial optimization problems using neural networks and RL. Its contributions are well-motivated, clearly articulated, and supported by empirical evidence. The work opens up an exciting avenue for exploring neural-based methods for optimization problems, particularly in scenarios where problem-specific heuristics are challenging to design. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly in benchmarking against standard datasets and addressing scalability to more complex problem variants.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Motivation: The use of pointer networks with RL for combinatorial optimization is a novel contribution. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in sequence-to-sequence learning and attention mechanisms. The motivation to reduce reliance on handcrafted heuristics is compelling and aligns with broader trends in machine learning.
   
2. Clarity and Rigor: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the architecture, training procedure, and experimental setup. The use of both RL pretraining and active search strategies is a thoughtful addition, providing insights into the trade-offs between computational cost and performance.
3. Empirical Validation: The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on TSP and Knapsack problems. The comparison with supervised learning approaches highlights the advantages of the RL paradigm for these tasks.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability and Generalization: The claim that the pointer network can handle general combinatorial optimization problems is ambitious. The authors should discuss how the approach might scale to problems with complex constraints (e.g., TSP with time windows or multiple salesmen). Including experiments or theoretical insights on feasibility challenges would strengthen the paper.
2. Benchmarking: The lack of comparison with standard operations research benchmarks, such as TSPLIB, is a notable omission. Incorporating these benchmarks would provide a clearer picture of the method's competitiveness relative to traditional solvers.
3. Computational Efficiency: While the paper acknowledges the longer runtime of RL pretraining and active search, a more detailed analysis of computational costs (e.g., GPU vs. CPU comparisons) would be helpful. This would allow practitioners to better assess the trade-offs between performance and efficiency.
4. Constraint Handling: The discussion on handling constraints in more complex problems is limited. Future work could explore methods to enforce feasibility during decoding or incorporate penalty terms into the reward function, as suggested by the authors.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the method perform on standard TSP benchmarks like TSPLIB? Can the results be compared directly to state-of-the-art solvers on these datasets?
2. What are the limitations of the pointer network architecture in handling problems with more complex constraints, such as TSP with time windows or vehicle routing problems?
3. How does the computational cost of the proposed method compare to traditional solvers, particularly for larger problem instances?
In conclusion, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of neural combinatorial optimization. While there are areas for improvement, the novelty and potential impact of the approach warrant acceptance.
