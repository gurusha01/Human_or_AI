Review of "Identifying Biclusters by Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs)"
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes the use of Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs), a deep learning-based extension of the FABIA biclustering method, to address limitations in existing biclustering approaches. RFNs are claimed to overcome FABIA's shortcomings, such as limited scalability, insufficient decorrelation of code units, and difficulty in determining sample membership. The authors benchmark RFNs against 13 other biclustering methods on synthetic, gene expression, and genomic datasets, reporting superior performance in most cases. The paper highlights RFN's ability to identify rare and small biclusters efficiently, leveraging GPU acceleration and sparse coding techniques.
Decision: Reject
The decision to reject is based on two primary reasons: (1) the lack of methodological novelty and (2) insufficient experimental rigor and clarity. While the paper builds upon a prior NIPS 2015 work by the same authors, it fails to introduce significant conceptual advancements, relying heavily on existing techniques. Additionally, the experimental setup lacks transparency, particularly in the tuning of critical hyperparameters, which raises concerns about reproducibility and generalizability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Methodology and Originality: The paper primarily repurposes RFNs, introduced in the authors' previous work, for biclustering. While the application to biclustering is novel, the underlying methods (e.g., rectified Gaussian posteriors, dropout for decorrelation) are not. The lack of substantial theoretical or algorithmic innovation limits the paper's contribution to the field.
2. Experimental Procedure: The experimental setup is poorly described. Key details, such as the determination of the sparsity hyperparameter (α) and the choice of dropout rates, are missing. These parameters critically influence RFN's performance, making the results difficult to interpret or replicate. Furthermore, the absence of publicly available code undermines the empirical claims.
3. Writing and Presentation: The paper's writing style is unscientific, resembling an industry white paper rather than an academic contribution. References to companies (e.g., Bayer, Zalando) are unnecessary and detract from the scientific focus. Additionally, Table 1 is unreadable and should be replaced with clearer visualizations or moved to supplementary materials.
4. Significance: While RFNs show promising results on benchmark datasets, the lack of implementation details and undefined tuning methods casts doubt on the generalizability of the findings. The paper does not convincingly demonstrate that RFNs are a significant improvement over FABIA or other state-of-the-art methods in real-world applications.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Experimental Setup: Provide detailed descriptions of hyperparameter tuning, dataset preprocessing, and evaluation metrics. Include a discussion of how sparsity and dropout rates were determined and their impact on performance.
2. Improve Writing Quality: Rewrite the paper in a more formal, scientific tone. Remove references to companies and focus on the technical contributions and empirical findings.
3. Enhance Presentation: Reformat Table 1 for readability or replace it with more interpretable figures. Move supplementary results to an appendix.
4. Provide Code and Reproducibility: Make the RFN implementation publicly available to enable reproducibility and facilitate further research.
Questions for the Authors
1. How were the sparsity hyperparameter (α) and dropout rates selected? Were they optimized for each dataset, and if so, how?
2. Can you provide more details on the GPU implementation and its impact on computational efficiency compared to FABIA?
3. How do RFNs perform on datasets with overlapping biclusters, and how does this compare to FABIA and other methods?
4. Will the code for RFNs be made publicly available to validate the empirical results?
In conclusion, while the application of RFNs to biclustering is an interesting idea, the paper lacks sufficient novelty, clarity, and rigor to warrant acceptance in its current form. Addressing the outlined concerns could significantly strengthen the work.
