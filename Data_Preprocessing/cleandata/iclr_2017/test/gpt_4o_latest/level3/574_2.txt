Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
The paper presents a large-scale visual search system tailored for a fashion e-commerce platform. The system integrates recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for multi-label attribute recognition and Faster R-CNN for region-of-interest (ROI) detection and feature extraction. The authors claim that their approach effectively combines semantic and visual similarity to retrieve fashion items, leveraging a custom dataset of over 1 million images annotated with 90+ fashion-related attributes. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel vision encoder network (ResCeption) based on Inception-v3 with residual connections and applies RNNs to model attribute dependencies implicitly. The system is designed to handle user-guided queries and offers a scalable inverted indexing scheme for efficient retrieval.
Decision: Reject
The paper is rejected due to the lack of technical novelty, insufficient empirical validation, and poor presentation quality. While the application is interesting, the contributions are incremental and fail to meet the standards of originality and rigor expected at this conference.
Supporting Arguments for the Decision
1. Lack of Novelty: The methods employed, such as RNNs for multi-label classification and Faster R-CNN for ROI detection, are standard state-of-the-art techniques. The paper does not introduce significant innovations in methodology or demonstrate how these techniques have been adapted in a novel way for the fashion domain. The ResCeption network, while slightly modified, does not offer compelling improvements over existing architectures.
2. Insufficient Baseline Comparisons: The paper does not compare the RNN-based multi-label attribute recognition with simpler baselines, such as binary relevance or label combination methods. This omission makes it difficult to assess the necessity and effectiveness of using RNNs for this task.
3. Private Dataset: The results are reported on a private dataset that will not be released, limiting reproducibility and the ability to benchmark against other methods. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed system.
4. Unclear Technical Details: The sequential prediction order in the RNN appears to follow a tree hierarchy of attributes, but this is not clearly explained or justified. Additionally, the claim that the RNN implicitly learns attribute dependencies is not substantiated with sufficient evidence or analysis.
5. Writing and Organization: The paper is poorly written, with several grammatical errors and a lack of clarity in the presentation of ideas. Figures and tables are referenced but not adequately explained, making it difficult to follow the technical content.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarify Technical Contributions: Clearly articulate the novel aspects of the system and how they advance the state of the art. If the novelty lies in the application, emphasize the challenges specific to the fashion domain and how the proposed system addresses them.
2. Baseline Comparisons: Include comparisons with simpler methods for multi-label classification and ROI detection to justify the use of advanced techniques like RNNs and Faster R-CNN.
3. Dataset Availability: Consider releasing the dataset or providing a subset for benchmarking. This would significantly enhance the impact and credibility of the work.
4. Explain RNN Predictions: Provide a detailed explanation of the sequential prediction process in the RNN and the rationale for the chosen order. Visualizations or ablation studies could help demonstrate the learning of attribute dependencies.
5. Improve Writing and Organization: Revise the paper for clarity and coherence. Ensure that all figures, tables, and equations are well-explained and directly support the claims made in the text.
Questions for the Authors
1. Why was an RNN chosen for multi-label classification over simpler methods like binary relevance? Can you provide quantitative evidence to justify this choice?
2. How does the proposed ResCeption network compare to standard architectures like Inception-v3 or ResNet in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency?
3. Can you elaborate on the tree hierarchy of attributes and how it influences the sequential prediction order in the RNN?
4. Are there plans to release the dataset or provide a benchmark for reproducibility?
5. How does the system perform on publicly available datasets, and how does it generalize beyond the private dataset used in the experiments?
By addressing these issues, the paper could be significantly improved and potentially resubmitted to a future conference.
