Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the potential of transfer learning in question-answering (QA) systems by pre-training models on data-rich domains and testing their performance on data-scarce target domains. The authors use two large-scale datasets, BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, for pre-training and evaluate transfer to subsets of bAbI and SQuAD datasets. The results reveal that transfer learning is largely ineffective without labeled examples from the target domain, though pre-training does provide some benefits when combined with small amounts of target-domain data. The paper also explores whether pre-training benefits specific components of the model, such as word embeddings or context encoders, and concludes that both are important. While the study does not advance state-of-the-art performance, it is positioned as an early step toward understanding transfer learning in text comprehension.
Decision: Reject
The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of actionable insights and the absence of a sharp analysis of failure modes. While the paper identifies that transfer learning struggles in QA systems without target-domain data, it does not provide sufficient analysis or theoretical grounding to explain why this is the case. As a result, the paper offers limited value in terms of guiding future research or practical applications.
Supporting Arguments
1. Limited Novelty and Actionable Insights: The paper confirms a known limitation of transfer learning—that it performs poorly without target-domain data—but does not offer new methods, frameworks, or insights to address this issue. The findings are largely descriptive and do not provide actionable takeaways for researchers or practitioners.
   
2. Lack of Rigorous Analysis: The paper does not delve deeply into the reasons behind the observed negative results. For example, while it mentions potential factors such as dataset distribution differences and syntax mismatches, these are not systematically analyzed or empirically validated. A sharper exploration of failure modes would have significantly enhanced the paper's contribution.
3. Positioning in the Literature: While the paper claims to be the first to study transfer learning in reading comprehension, it does not sufficiently engage with related work in transfer learning and domain adaptation. This weakens its motivation and contextualization within the broader research landscape.
4. Experimental Design and Scope: The experiments are well-executed but limited in scope. The focus on a single model architecture (AS Reader) and the use of only two pre-training datasets restrict the generalizability of the findings. Exploring additional architectures or datasets could have strengthened the conclusions.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Analyze Failure Modes: Conduct a deeper analysis of why transfer learning fails in the studied scenarios. For example, investigate the impact of vocabulary overlap, syntactic differences, or reasoning requirements between datasets. This could provide valuable insights for designing more effective transfer learning approaches.
2. Expand Experimental Scope: Test additional pre-training datasets and model architectures to assess whether the observed limitations are specific to the chosen setup or generalizable across QA systems.
3. Provide Actionable Takeaways: Suggest concrete strategies or research directions to address the challenges identified in the study. For instance, explore techniques like domain adaptation, curriculum learning, or meta-learning to improve transfer performance.
4. Clarify Contributions: Clearly articulate how the findings advance the understanding of transfer learning in QA systems. Position the work more explicitly within the existing literature and highlight its unique contributions.
Questions for the Authors
1. What specific factors do you hypothesize contribute to the poor transfer performance, and how could these be systematically analyzed in future work?
2. Did you explore alternative model architectures or pre-training datasets, and if not, why were these choices limited to AS Reader and the two datasets?
3. Can you provide more details on the differences in dataset distributions (e.g., vocabulary, syntax, reasoning requirements) and their potential impact on transfer learning?
By addressing these issues, the paper could make a more substantial contribution to the field.
