Summary of the Paper
This paper investigates the "fundamental nature of learning representations in neural networks" through the lens of pruning algorithms. It proposes a novel algorithm for pruning entire neurons from trained neural networks using a second-order Taylor series approximation. The authors compare their method to a first-order Taylor approximation and a brute-force pruning approach. The paper claims that pruning can reduce neural networks to 40-70% of their original size without significant performance degradation, particularly when using the brute-force method. The authors also explore the theoretical implications of pruning on the distribution of learning representations in neural networks, corroborating prior observations that neural networks do not distribute learning evenly across neurons.
Decision: Reject
The paper falls short of the standards required for acceptance due to its lack of novelty, limited experimental scope, and insufficient contributions to the field of pruning or neural network representation learning. While the topic is intriguing, the execution and insights provided are not sufficiently impactful.
Supporting Arguments for Rejection
1. Lack of Novelty in Pruning Algorithms: The proposed pruning algorithm, while sensible, is overly simplistic and does not advance the state of the art. The reliance on second-order Taylor approximations is not novel, and the brute-force method, while effective, is computationally prohibitive and not practical for real-world applications. The paper does not offer new insights into making brute-force pruning computationally tractable.
   
2. Limited Experimental Scope: The experiments are restricted to toy problems and the MNIST dataset, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Modern neural networks are significantly larger and more complex than those studied here, and the paper does not address how the proposed methods would scale to such networks or datasets.
3. Lack of Significant Contributions: The paper does not provide meaningful algorithmic, architectural, or mathematical contributions. The theoretical insights into learning representations are largely re-confirmations of prior work (e.g., Mozer & Smolensky, 1989) rather than new discoveries.
4. Overly Lengthy and Redundant Introduction: The introduction and literature review are unnecessarily long and include redundant elements, such as Figure 1 and parts of Section 3.3.0, which do not add value to the core contributions of the paper.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Expand Experimental Scope: To make the results more impactful, the authors should test their pruning methods on larger, more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) and modern architectures (e.g., ResNet, Transformers). This would provide stronger evidence of the practical utility of their approach.
2. Address Computational Scalability: The brute-force method is computationally expensive and impractical for large networks. The authors should explore approximations or heuristics to make this method scalable while retaining its effectiveness.
3. Refine the Introduction: The introduction should be more concise and focused on the novel aspects of the work. Redundant sections, such as Figure 1 and parts of Section 3.3.0, should be removed or streamlined.
4. Strengthen Theoretical Contributions: The paper should go beyond confirming prior observations and provide new theoretical insights into the nature of learning representations in neural networks. For example, the authors could explore how their findings extend to deeper networks or different training paradigms.
5. Include Retraining Experiments: While the authors argue against using retraining to evaluate pruning methods, it is a standard practice in the field. Including retraining experiments would make the results more comparable to existing work.
Questions for the Authors
1. How do you envision making the brute-force pruning method computationally feasible for modern, large-scale neural networks?
2. Have you considered testing your pruning methods on more complex datasets and architectures? If not, why?
3. Can you provide more detailed insights into how the proposed second-order Taylor approximation compares to existing second-order pruning methods like Optimal Brain Surgeon?
4. How does your method perform when combined with retraining, which is a common practice in pruning research?
In conclusion, while the paper touches on an interesting topic, it does not meet the bar for acceptance due to its limited novelty, narrow experimental scope, and insufficient contributions. Addressing the above concerns could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work.
