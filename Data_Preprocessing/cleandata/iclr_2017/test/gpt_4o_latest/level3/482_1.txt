Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper presents a novel application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict patient medications based on billing codes, addressing a critical issue in electronic medical records (EMRs): the omission of active medications. The authors utilize a large and diverse dataset of over 3.3 million instances derived from 610,076 patient records, making this study more robust than typical machine learning studies reliant on toy datasets. The paper demonstrates that Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) outperform other models, achieving high prediction accuracy (micro-averaged AUC of 0.93 and Label Ranking Loss of 0.076). The authors also highlight the potential of their approach to identify missing medications and billing codes, which could improve medication reconciliation in clinical practice. The work is well-written and organized, making a compelling case for the use of deep learning in healthcare applications.
Decision: Accept (with minor revisions)
The paper is a solid contribution to the field of machine learning applications in healthcare. It addresses a significant real-world problem, uses an impressive dataset, and demonstrates the potential of RNNs in this domain. However, the decision to accept is contingent on addressing the following key areas for improvement.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Strengths:
   - The problem tackled is both important and underexplored, with clear implications for improving patient care.
   - The dataset is extensive and diverse, providing a strong foundation for the study.
   - The paper is well-motivated and builds on relevant literature, comparing RNNs to other models like feed-forward networks and random forests.
   - The results, particularly the high AUC and low Label Ranking Loss, are promising and suggest clinical utility.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The empirical investigation of results lacks depth. Numerical results are presented briefly, and some figures (e.g., Fig. 4) are anecdotal rather than comprehensive.
   - Fig. 5, which explores the semantic embedding of ICD-9 codes, is interesting but does not contribute meaningfully to the performance analysis. Replacing it with a more detailed performance breakdown (e.g., precision-recall curves or confusion matrices) would enhance clarity.
   - Table 1 provides limited empirical evidence. Additional experiments, such as ablation studies or sensitivity analyses, would strengthen the claims.
   - The paper uses domain-specific jargon that may not be accessible to the typical ICLR reader, limiting its reach.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Replace Fig. 5 with a more meaningful analysis of model performance, such as comparisons across different patient subgroups or additional metrics like F1-score and recall.
2. Expand the discussion of numerical results to provide deeper insights into model behavior, particularly in cases with high label noise.
3. Tighten the use of medical jargon and provide explanations for terms that may be unfamiliar to a general machine learning audience.
4. Consider including a qualitative analysis of failure cases to better understand the limitations of the model.
5. While the paper is suitable for ICLR, the authors could briefly discuss its relevance to other venues, such as medical informatics conferences, to contextualize its interdisciplinary impact.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model handle rare billing codes or medications with low prevalence in the dataset? Are these cases disproportionately affected by label noise?
2. Could the authors provide more details on the hardware constraints that limited the model size? How might larger models improve performance?
3. Have the authors considered incorporating additional features, such as demographic data or lab results, to further enhance predictive accuracy?
4. How robust is the model to temporal shifts in billing code practices, such as the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10?
Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the machine learning and healthcare communities. Addressing the suggested revisions will further strengthen its impact and accessibility.
