The paper presents a novel approach to extending neural conversational models into the batch reinforcement learning (RL) setting using off-policy learning, addressing the challenge of high-cost human scoring data. The authors propose a Batch Policy Gradient (BPG) method that leverages importance sampling and λ-returns to optimize chatbot policies with limited labeled data. The approach is empirically validated through synthetic experiments and a real-world dataset on restaurant recommendations, demonstrating modest but meaningful improvements over baseline methods.
Decision: Reject
While the paper is well-written and introduces a relevant application of off-policy actor-critic methods to dialogue generation, the contribution is modest and raises significant concerns regarding scalability and dataset limitations. The primary dataset of 6,000 conversations is small compared to standard datasets in dialogue generation literature, and the ability of RNN chatbots to generate reasonable utterances on such limited data is surprising but unconvincing without further evidence. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address whether the proposed method would generalize or show improvements when applied to larger, unsupervised datasets.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Strengths:
   - The problem tackled—training chatbots with noisy, expensive rewards in a batch RL setting—is both relevant and well-motivated. The authors clearly articulate the challenges of off-policy and batch RL in this context.
   - The proposed BPG method is a thoughtful adaptation of policy gradient methods to the batch setting, with theoretical grounding and practical considerations like importance sampling and λ-returns.
   - The writing is clear and accessible, making the technical contributions easy to follow.
2. Weaknesses:
   - The dataset size (6,000 conversations for training and 1,216 for RL fine-tuning) is a major limitation. Dialogue generation models typically require much larger datasets to generalize effectively. The paper does not convincingly address how the method would scale to larger datasets or whether the observed improvements would persist.
   - The empirical results, while showing statistical significance in some cases, are modest and noisy, particularly in the real-world restaurant recommendation task. The improvements, though measurable, may not justify the complexity of the proposed approach.
   - The reliance on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for evaluation introduces subjectivity and noise, which could undermine the reliability of the results. The authors acknowledge this but do not propose robust alternatives.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Scalability: Provide experiments or theoretical analysis to demonstrate how the method would scale to larger datasets or more complex conversational domains. This is critical for establishing the broader applicability of the approach.
2. Evaluation: Include additional evaluation metrics beyond AMT scores, such as BLEU or diversity metrics, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the chatbot's performance.
3. Comparative Analysis: Compare the proposed method against more recent state-of-the-art RL or supervised learning approaches for dialogue generation, especially those using larger datasets.
4. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of key components like importance sampling and λ-returns, providing deeper insights into their impact on performance.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the proposed method perform on larger datasets or in domains with more diverse conversational contexts?
2. Could the noisy and subjective nature of AMT scoring be mitigated by introducing automated or semi-automated evaluation metrics?
3. What are the computational costs of the BPG method compared to on-policy or online RL methods? Would these costs scale with larger datasets?
In summary, while the paper addresses an important problem and proposes a technically sound solution, the limitations in dataset size, scalability, and evaluation undermine its impact. Addressing these concerns in future work could significantly strengthen the contribution.
