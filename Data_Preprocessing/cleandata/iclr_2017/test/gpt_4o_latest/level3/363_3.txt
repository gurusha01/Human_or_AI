Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes a general "compare-aggregate" framework for natural language understanding tasks that involve comparing two textual sequences, such as question answering and textual entailment. The authors introduce a model that uses soft attention, a variety of comparison functions, and CNN-based aggregation to perform word-level matching and decision-making. The paper systematically evaluates six comparison functions, including novel element-wise operations (SUB, MULT, and SUBMULT+NN), and demonstrates the model's effectiveness across four datasets: MovieQA, InsuranceQA, WikiQA, and SNLI. The results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on these tasks, highlighting the generalizability of the framework. The authors also make their code publicly available, which is a valuable contribution to the research community.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a strong case for acceptance due to its timely contribution to an important problem in NLP, the generalizability of its framework across multiple datasets, and its systematic evaluation of comparison functions. However, some limitations and areas for improvement should be addressed in the final version.
Supporting Arguments for Acceptance
1. Timeliness and Relevance: The proposed framework addresses a major open issue in NLP—sequence matching—using representation learning methods. The results demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse tasks, making the contribution broadly applicable.
2. Scientific Rigor: The paper systematically evaluates six comparison functions, providing insights into their relative strengths. The experimental results are robust, with extensive comparisons against strong baselines and state-of-the-art models.
3. Incremental but Substantial Contribution: While the "compare-aggregate" framework is not novel, the paper's focus on systematically analyzing comparison functions and applying the model to multiple datasets is a meaningful advancement.
4. Practical Impact: The availability of the code and the detailed analysis of comparison functions make the work highly reproducible and useful for future research.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Word Order Sensitivity: The model's insensitivity to word order, particularly in the preprocessing layer, limits its performance on tasks with longer sequences. This limitation should be explicitly discussed in the introduction or discussion section, along with potential solutions such as incorporating RNNs or transformers for contextual encoding.
2. Citation of Related Work: The attention mechanism aligns more closely with Luong et al. (2015) than Bahdanau et al. (2014) and should appropriately cite the former. Additionally, the resemblance of the SubMultNN approach to Lili Mou's work should be acknowledged.
3. Overfitting Risk: The Neural Tensor Network (NTN) comparison function has a large parameter count, which could lead to overfitting. The authors should consider reducing the output dimension or exploring regularization techniques to mitigate this risk.
4. Preprocessing Parameters: The shared preprocessing parameters for questions and answers may overlook the need for different weighting priorities. This limitation should be discussed, and the authors could explore task-specific preprocessing strategies in future work.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model perform on longer sequences where word order and context are more critical? Have you considered integrating RNNs or transformers into the preprocessing layer to address this limitation?
2. What motivated the choice of CNN for aggregation instead of other architectures like LSTMs or transformers? Could you provide insights into how this choice impacts performance?
3. For the NTN comparison function, did you observe any signs of overfitting during training? If so, how did you address it?
4. Could you elaborate on the decision to use shared preprocessing parameters for questions and answers? Did you experiment with task-specific preprocessing, and if so, how did it affect performance?
In conclusion, this paper provides a solid contribution to the field of NLP and warrants strong acceptance. Addressing the aforementioned limitations and questions would further strengthen the work.
