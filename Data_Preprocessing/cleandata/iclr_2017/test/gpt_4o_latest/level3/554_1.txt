Review
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the integration of eligibility traces with Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) in the context of reinforcement learning, specifically in the Atari domain. It explores how eligibility traces can accelerate learning by propagating rewards across multiple timesteps and evaluates the impact of using the Adam optimizer instead of RMSprop for training. The authors provide experimental results on two Atari games, Pong and Tennis, demonstrating that eligibility traces improve learning stability and speed, while Adam significantly accelerates convergence. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the methodology and insightful discussions of the results.
Decision: Reject
While the direction of the research is promising, the paper lacks sufficient novelty and experimental rigor to warrant acceptance at this stage. The primary contributions—applying eligibility traces and Adam to DRQN—are incremental and not sufficiently novel. Furthermore, the limited scope of experiments (only two Atari games) makes it difficult to generalize the findings to broader domains. 
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty: The paper primarily combines existing techniques (eligibility traces, DRQN, and Adam) without introducing significant methodological innovations. While the integration of these components is interesting, it does not push the boundaries of current reinforcement learning research.
2. Experimental Scope: The experiments are limited to two Atari games, which is insufficient for evaluating the general applicability of the proposed approach. Atari games are diverse, and results on only Pong and Tennis do not provide enough evidence to support the claims of general performance improvements.
3. Scientific Rigor: The results are presented clearly, but the lack of error bars or statistical significance testing (e.g., across multiple random seeds) reduces confidence in the reported findings. Additionally, the authors do not explore the sensitivity of their approach to key hyperparameters, such as the trace decay factor (λ) or optimizer settings.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Broader Experimental Validation: Include results on a wider range of Atari games or other domains to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. This would strengthen the empirical claims and provide more robust evidence of the method's effectiveness.
2. Statistical Rigor: Report results averaged over multiple runs with different random seeds and include error bars to account for variability in performance. This would make the findings more scientifically rigorous.
3. Ablation Studies: Conduct ablation studies to isolate the contributions of eligibility traces and Adam. For example, compare DRQN with eligibility traces but without Adam, and vice versa, to better understand the individual impact of each component.
4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Explore the sensitivity of the method to key hyperparameters, such as λ, learning rates, and the frozen network update frequency. This would provide deeper insights into the robustness of the approach.
5. Theoretical Insights: While the empirical results are promising, providing theoretical insights or analysis into why eligibility traces and Adam work well together in this context would add depth to the paper.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of the proposed method vary across different random seeds? Could you provide results with error bars to quantify variability?
2. Why were only two Atari games chosen for evaluation? Are there plans to extend the experiments to a broader set of games or domains?
3. Did you explore the impact of different values of λ (e.g., λ = 0.5 or λ = 1.0) on learning performance? If so, what were the findings?
4. How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art approaches, such as Double DQN or Rainbow, on the same tasks?
In conclusion, while the paper explores a worthwhile direction and presents promising results, it requires more substantial contributions and broader experimental validation to meet the standards of the conference. The suggestions above aim to help the authors improve the quality and impact of their work.
