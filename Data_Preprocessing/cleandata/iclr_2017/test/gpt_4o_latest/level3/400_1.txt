The paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Doubly Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN), designed to generate tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The architecture incorporates two orthogonal temporal dimensions—depth and width recurrences—allowing it to model parent-child and sibling-sibling relationships separately. This design explicitly predicts tree topology alongside node labels, avoiding the need for artificial padding tokens. The authors demonstrate the DRNN's effectiveness in recovering tree structures from flattened strings, mapping natural language descriptions to abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in the IFTTT dataset, and exploring its potential in machine translation tasks.
Decision: Accept
The primary reasons for acceptance are the novelty and potential impact of the proposed architecture. The DRNN introduces a well-motivated and innovative approach to tree-structured decoding, addressing limitations in existing methods such as reliance on artificial tokens or isolated training of topological predictors. The exploration of explicit topological prediction and the decoupling of depth and width recurrences are significant contributions. While the experimental scope is limited, the results convincingly demonstrate the architecture's promise, particularly in recovering latent tree structures and mapping sentences to functional programs.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Novelty and Motivation: The DRNN addresses a gap in the literature by providing a unified, end-to-end trainable architecture for tree generation. Its explicit modeling of tree topology and separation of depth and width recurrences are innovative and well-justified.
2. Experimental Validation: The experiments, though limited in scope, are sufficient to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. The DRNN outperforms strong baselines in recovering tree structures and achieves competitive results in the IFTTT task, particularly in terms of F1 scores for AST recovery.
3. Potential Impact: The architecture has broad applicability beyond the tasks explored, including program synthesis, natural language parsing, and hierarchical data modeling. Its robustness to structural variations and coarse-to-fine generation capabilities are particularly promising for future research.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Broader Dataset Evaluation: The paper would benefit from experiments on natural language datasets with syntactic tree structures, such as dependency or constituency parsing tasks. This would better showcase the DRNN's applicability to real-world NLP problems.
2. Ablation Studies: While the exploration of termination strategies is a strength, further ablation studies on the impact of decoupling depth and width recurrences or the explicit topological prediction mechanism would strengthen the claims.
3. Scalability Analysis: The authors briefly mention the potential for GPU batch processing but do not provide implementation details or benchmarks. A discussion of scalability and computational efficiency would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the DRNN handle noisy or ambiguous input data, particularly in tasks like natural language parsing where tree structures may not be well-defined?
2. Could the architecture be extended to handle graph-structured data, where nodes may have multiple parents or more complex relationships?
3. How does the DRNN compare to state-of-the-art tree-based transformers or graph neural networks in terms of performance and scalability?
In conclusion, the DRNN is a novel and impactful contribution to the field of structured data modeling, and its acceptance is well-justified. Addressing the suggested improvements would further enhance the paper's clarity and applicability.
