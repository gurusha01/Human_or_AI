Review of the Paper
This paper presents ACER (Actor-Critic with Experience Replay), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm designed to improve sample efficiency and stability in both discrete and continuous action spaces. The authors introduce three key innovations: truncated importance sampling with bias correction, stochastic dueling networks, and an efficient trust region policy optimization method. The paper demonstrates ACER's effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including the 57-game Atari domain and continuous control tasks in MuJoCo, achieving state-of-the-art performance in sample efficiency while maintaining stability.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes significant contributions to reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of sample efficiency in actor-critic methods. The proposed innovations are well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated across diverse tasks. The results convincingly demonstrate ACER's superiority over existing methods like A3C and DQN in terms of sample efficiency and stability.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Contributions: The paper introduces three innovative techniques that address key limitations in reinforcement learning. Truncated importance sampling with bias correction effectively balances variance and bias, stochastic dueling networks improve value estimation, and the trust region policy optimization ensures stable updates. These contributions are novel and represent a significant advancement over existing methods.
   
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments are thorough and demonstrate ACER's effectiveness across a wide range of tasks. The results on Atari games show that ACER achieves comparable performance to DQN with prioritized replay while being more sample efficient. In continuous control tasks, ACER significantly outperforms baselines, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces.
3. Theoretical Rigor: The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation for their methods, including a proof that Retrace can be interpreted as truncated importance sampling with bias correction. This strengthens the credibility of the proposed approach.
4. Practical Usefulness: The algorithm is highly practical, as it combines on-policy and off-policy learning to achieve both data efficiency and computational efficiency. The trust region optimization method is particularly promising for stabilizing training in other deep learning domains.
Additional Feedback
1. Clarity: While the paper is dense, it is generally well-written. However, some sections, such as the derivation of the trust region policy optimization, could benefit from additional explanation or visual aids to improve accessibility for non-experts.
2. Ablation Studies: The ablation analysis is valuable, but the paper could provide more detailed insights into how each component contributes to performance. For example, the impact of stochastic dueling networks on continuous control tasks could be further elaborated.
3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis is appreciated, but the paper could include more discussion on how to select hyperparameters like the truncation threshold (c) and trust region constraint (δ) in practice.
4. Limitations: While the paper briefly mentions limitations, it could explicitly discuss potential challenges, such as scalability to environments with extremely high-dimensional state spaces or the computational overhead of maintaining replay buffers.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does ACER compare to other recent algorithms like PPO or SAC in terms of sample efficiency and computational cost?
2. What are the practical guidelines for selecting the truncation threshold (c) and trust region constraint (δ) in new environments?
3. Could the proposed trust region optimization method be applied to other domains, such as supervised learning or generative modeling? If so, what modifications would be required?
In conclusion, this paper makes a strong contribution to reinforcement learning and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference. The proposed ACER algorithm is a step forward in addressing the challenges of sample efficiency and stability, and it has the potential to influence future research in the field.
