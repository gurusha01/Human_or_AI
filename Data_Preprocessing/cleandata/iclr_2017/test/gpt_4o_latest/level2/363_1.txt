The paper presents a "compare-aggregate" framework for sequence matching tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and evaluates its effectiveness across four datasets: MovieQA, InsuranceQA, WikiQA, and SNLI. The authors systematically explore six comparison functions, including novel element-wise operations (SUB and MULT), and demonstrate that these functions outperform traditional neural network-based approaches in many cases. The paper claims two main contributions: (1) demonstrating the general effectiveness of the "compare-aggregate" framework across diverse tasks, and (2) identifying element-wise comparison functions as particularly effective for word-level matching. The authors also provide their code for reproducibility.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons:
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper provides a systematic evaluation of comparison functions within the "compare-aggregate" framework, which is a significant contribution to sequence matching research. The introduction of element-wise comparison functions (SUB and MULT) as effective alternatives is novel and impactful.
2. Empirical Rigor: The model is evaluated on four diverse datasets, and the results are competitive or superior to state-of-the-art baselines. The authors also conduct ablation studies to validate the importance of different components, such as the preprocessing and attention layers.
Supporting Arguments:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing gaps in prior work, such as the lack of systematic evaluation of comparison functions and limited application of the "compare-aggregate" framework to multiple tasks.
- The experiments are thorough, with clear baselines and metrics (accuracy, MAP, MRR). The findings are consistent and demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.
- The authors provide valuable insights, such as the importance of preprocessing and attention layers for different datasets, and the role of word-by-word comparison in tasks with significant sequence length differences.
- The inclusion of the code enhances reproducibility and encourages further research in this area.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, some sections, such as the detailed mathematical formulations, could benefit from additional explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the framework.
2. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the computational efficiency of the element-wise comparison functions compared to neural network-based methods could be explored further.
3. Future Work: The authors mention testing the framework on multi-task learning as future work. Expanding on this idea with preliminary experiments or a discussion of potential challenges would strengthen the paper.
Questions for Authors:
1. How does the computational cost of the element-wise comparison functions (SUB, MULT) compare to the neural network-based functions (NN, NTN)? Are these methods scalable to larger datasets or longer sequences?
2. Did the authors explore any additional preprocessing techniques, such as contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT), and how might these impact the performance of the "compare-aggregate" framework?
3. Could the proposed framework be extended to handle tasks beyond sequence matching, such as sequence generation or multi-hop reasoning?
Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the field of NLP by advancing the understanding of comparison functions within the "compare-aggregate" framework and demonstrating its versatility across tasks. With minor clarifications and a discussion of limitations, the paper is well-suited for acceptance.
