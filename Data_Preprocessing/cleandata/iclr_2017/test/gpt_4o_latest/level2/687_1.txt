Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the relationship between neural network pruning algorithms and the fundamental nature of learning representations in neural networks. The authors propose a novel algorithm for pruning entire neurons (as opposed to weights) using a second-order Taylor series approximation of the error change. They compare this method with a first-order Taylor approximation and a brute-force pruning approach, which serves as an oracle. The paper provides strong empirical evidence that neural networks do not distribute learning representations evenly across neurons, corroborating earlier hypotheses by Mozer & Smolensky (1989). The authors demonstrate that up to 40-70% of neurons can be pruned without retraining and with minimal performance degradation, particularly when using the brute-force method. They also highlight the limitations of first- and second-order approximations and discuss the implications of their findings for network generalization and compression in memory-constrained environments.
Decision: Reject
While the paper provides valuable insights into neural network learning representations and pruning, it falls short in several key areas that limit its impact and suitability for acceptance. The primary reasons for rejection are the lack of novelty in the pruning methodology and insufficient rigor in addressing computational feasibility.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty: The proposed second-order Taylor approximation for pruning neurons builds on well-established ideas, such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. While the focus on pruning neurons rather than weights is interesting, this distinction is not sufficiently novel to justify acceptance. The brute-force method, while effective, is computationally prohibitive and not a practical contribution.
2. Practicality and Scalability: The brute-force method, which consistently outperforms the proposed algorithm, is computationally infeasible for large-scale networks. The authors do not provide a clear path to making this method tractable, limiting the practical utility of their findings. Similarly, the second-order method, while more efficient, performs inconsistently and is computationally expensive for deeper networks.
3. Evaluation and Scope: The experiments are limited to relatively simple datasets (e.g., MNIST) and shallow networks. The paper does not explore the applicability of the proposed methods to deeper architectures or more complex datasets, which are critical for assessing the real-world utility of the approach.
4. Reproducibility: While the authors claim that detailed derivations are provided in the supplementary material, the paper itself lacks sufficient mathematical detail to fully understand the proposed algorithm. This limits the ability of readers to reproduce and build upon the work.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Scalability: The authors should explore ways to approximate the brute-force method more efficiently, such as using subsets of training data or parallelization techniques. This would make the findings more practical and impactful.
2. Broader Evaluation: Extending the experiments to deeper networks and more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet) would strengthen the paper's claims and demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed methods.
3. Theoretical Insights: The paper would benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the limitations of first- and second-order approximations and their relationship to the observed dualism in neuron roles.
4. Re-training: While the authors argue against using re-training to evaluate pruning algorithms, incorporating re-training could provide a more realistic assessment of the practical utility of the proposed methods.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed second-order method scale to modern deep networks with millions of parameters? Have you considered any approximations to make the brute-force method computationally feasible?
2. Could you provide more details on the derivations and assumptions underlying the second-order Taylor approximation? How sensitive are the results to these assumptions?
3. Have you tested the proposed methods on datasets or architectures beyond MNIST and shallow networks? If not, how do you anticipate the methods would perform on deeper networks or more complex tasks?
Conclusion
The paper provides interesting empirical observations about neural network learning representations and pruning but lacks sufficient novelty, scalability, and evaluation to warrant acceptance. Addressing these issues in a future submission could significantly enhance the impact and relevance of the work.
