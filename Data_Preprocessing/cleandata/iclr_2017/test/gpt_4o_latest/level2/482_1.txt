The paper presents a novel application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically GRUs and LSTMs, to predict therapeutic classes of medications based on sequences of ICD-9 billing codes. The authors address a critical issue in electronic medical records (EMRs): the frequent omission or inaccuracy of active medication lists. The proposed model achieves strong predictive performance, with a micro-averaged AUC of 0.93 and a Label Ranking Loss of 0.076, and demonstrates potential for aiding medication reconciliation processes. The paper also highlights the robustness of the model in handling label noise and its ability to identify missing medications or billing codes. Additionally, the authors provide a comparative analysis of RNNs against feed-forward networks and random forests, emphasizing the utility of temporal sequence information.
Decision: Accept.  
Key reasons: (1) The paper addresses a significant real-world problem in healthcare, with clear practical implications. (2) The methodology is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and demonstrates strong empirical results.  
Supporting Arguments:  
1. Novelty and Contribution: The work is unique in its focus on predicting all active medications using billing code sequences, leveraging RNNs to exploit temporal dependencies. The comparison with non-recurrent models further validates the utility of sequence-based architectures.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The authors utilize a large dataset (3.3 million instances) and evaluate performance using robust metrics (AUC, Label Ranking Loss). The GRU model consistently outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.  
3. Practical Relevance: The proposed approach has clear clinical utility, as it can assist in identifying missing medications, a critical issue in EMRs. The authors also discuss the potential for integrating additional data (e.g., lab results) to enhance performance.  
Additional Feedback:  
1. Limitations and Future Work: While the authors acknowledge label noise and hardware constraints, a more detailed discussion on how these limitations might affect clinical deployment would strengthen the paper. For instance, how might the model handle rare or less common medications?  
2. Interpretability: The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of how clinicians might interpret and act on the model's predictions. For example, could the model provide explanations for its predictions to increase trust and usability?  
3. Evaluation of Embedding: The analysis of ICD-9 embeddings is intriguing but underexplored. Future work could focus on refining the embedding space to improve semantic coherence and classification performance.  
4. Broader Validation: The model's performance is evaluated on a single institution's dataset. Testing on external datasets or across different healthcare systems would enhance generalizability.  
Questions for the Authors:  
1. How does the model perform on rare therapeutic classes or less frequent billing codes?  
2. Could the model's predictions be integrated into existing clinical workflows without significant disruption?  
3. Have you considered augmenting the dataset with external sources (e.g., pharmacy records) to address label noise?  
Overall, the paper is well-executed and offers a promising solution to a pressing healthcare problem. With minor refinements and broader validation, this work has the potential to make a significant impact in clinical practice.
