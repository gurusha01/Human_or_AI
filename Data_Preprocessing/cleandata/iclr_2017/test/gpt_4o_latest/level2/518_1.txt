The paper proposes a novel algorithm for training stochastic neural networks to sample from target distributions, leveraging Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). The authors introduce an "amortized SVGD" approach, which adapts neural network parameters iteratively to minimize the KL divergence with the target distribution. This method is applied to train deep energy models using an adversarial framework, termed SteinGAN, which achieves competitive results in generating realistic images on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN. The paper claims to simplify variational inference by avoiding explicit computation of proposal densities and to improve computational efficiency in scenarios requiring repeated inference.
Decision: Accept
Key Reasons: 
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper introduces a principled extension of SVGD to neural samplers, addressing a critical limitation of traditional variational inference methods. The proposed SteinGAN framework is innovative and demonstrates strong empirical results.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are robust, with competitive image generation quality and quantitative metrics (e.g., inception scores, classification accuracy). The method is well-supported by comparisons to state-of-the-art GANs.
Supporting Arguments:
1. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-motivated, addressing inefficiencies in traditional inference methods and connecting its approach to related work (e.g., amortized inference, GANs, and Bayesian Monte Carlo). The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the field and provide comprehensive citations.
2. Technical Soundness: The derivation of the amortized SVGD algorithm is rigorous, with clear connections to existing methods like variational inference and the reparameterization trick. The use of SVGD's repulsive term to enforce sample diversity is a principled improvement over heuristic regularizers in prior work.
3. Practical Usefulness: The proposed method has broad applicability, particularly in scenarios requiring efficient sampling or generative modeling. The ability to generate high-quality images and the demonstrated scalability to large datasets (e.g., CelebA, LSUN) highlight its practical potential.
Additional Feedback:
1. Clarity: While the technical content is detailed, some sections (e.g., the derivation of updates in Algorithm 1) could benefit from clearer explanations or visual aids to improve accessibility for a broader audience.
2. Limitations: The paper does not explicitly discuss potential limitations, such as the computational cost of training the neural sampler or the sensitivity of performance to hyperparameters like the kernel bandwidth. Including these would strengthen the paper.
3. Evaluation Metrics: While the inception score and classification accuracy provide useful insights, additional metrics (e.g., Fr√©chet Inception Distance) could further validate the method's performance.
4. Theoretical Insights: The paper could explore theoretical guarantees for convergence or generalization, particularly in the context of amortized SVGD.
Questions for the Authors:
1. How does the choice of kernel in SVGD affect the performance of the neural sampler? Have you explored alternatives to the RBF kernel?
2. What are the computational trade-offs of amortized SVGD compared to traditional particle-based methods? Can this approach scale to higher-dimensional distributions?
3. Could the proposed method be extended to handle discrete distributions or hybrid models with both continuous and discrete variables?
Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to probabilistic inference and generative modeling, with strong empirical results and a well-motivated methodology. Addressing the feedback and questions could further enhance its impact.
