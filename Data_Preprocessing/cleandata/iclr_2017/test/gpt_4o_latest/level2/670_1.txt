Review of "MT-LRP: Multi-Task State Representation Learning with Robotic Priors"
Summary of the Paper
The paper introduces MT-LRP, a novel approach for learning state representations in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) using robotic priors. The method employs a gated neural network architecture to learn low-dimensional task-specific state representations from raw observations in an unsupervised manner, without prior knowledge of task labels or the number of tasks. A key contribution is the extension of the robotic priors framework with a task-coherence prior, which enforces task consistency within episodes and task separation across episodes. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of MT-LRP through simulated experiments, particularly in a slot-car racing scenario, showing that it outperforms baseline methods in learning task-specific representations and policies.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presents a novel contribution to multi-task RL, and provides strong empirical evidence supporting its claims. The method's ability to learn task-specific state representations without task labels is a significant advancement, and the inclusion of task-coherence priors is a meaningful innovation. However, some areas could benefit from further clarification and expansion.
Supporting Arguments for Decision
1. Novelty and Contribution: The paper combines robotic priors, task discovery, and gated neural networks in a unique way to address multi-task RL challenges. The introduction of task-coherence priors is a meaningful addition to the state representation learning literature.
2. Empirical Validation: The experiments convincingly demonstrate that MT-LRP outperforms baseline methods, particularly in scenarios with visual distractors. The analysis of learned state representations and task detection provides valuable insights into the method's effectiveness.
3. Relevance and Usefulness: The proposed method addresses a critical challenge in RLâ€”scaling to multi-task scenarios with minimal supervision. The approach is practical and has potential applications in robotics and other domains requiring task-specific skills.
Additional Feedback and Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the technical details are thorough, the paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the gated neural network architecture and its role in task detection. A more intuitive description or visual representation of the gating mechanism would help readers unfamiliar with the concept.
2. Ablation Studies: The paper evaluates the contribution of task-coherence priors but does not explore the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters (e.g., the number of gate units). Including such analyses would strengthen the empirical validation.
3. Generalization to Real-World Scenarios: The experiments are limited to simulated environments. While the slot-car racing scenario is illustrative, demonstrating the method's applicability to more complex, real-world tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation) would enhance its impact.
4. Task-Separation Loss: The results suggest that the task-separation loss may not be critical for performance. A deeper discussion of its role and potential drawbacks (e.g., over-segmentation) would be valuable.
5. Comparison with Multi-Task Learning: The paper briefly mentions multi-task learning approaches but does not provide a direct comparison. Evaluating MT-LRP against state-of-the-art multi-task RL methods would contextualize its performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the performance of MT-LRP scale with an increasing number of tasks or more complex observation spaces? Are there computational bottlenecks associated with the gating mechanism?
2. Could the method handle tasks with overlapping state representations or ambiguous task boundaries? If not, what modifications would be required?
3. How robust is MT-LRP to noise in the observations or rewards? Have you tested its performance in environments with higher levels of uncertainty?
In conclusion, the paper presents a significant contribution to multi-task RL and is well-suited for acceptance. Addressing the above suggestions would further strengthen the work and broaden its applicability.
