Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the integration of eligibility traces and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in deep reinforcement learning (RL), specifically within the Atari domain. The authors aim to address challenges in environments with sparse rewards and partial observability by combining eligibility traces, which propagate rewards back over multiple timesteps, with recurrent networks, which provide memory for temporal dependencies. The paper also explores the impact of different optimizers (RMSprop and Adam) on training performance. Through experiments on two Atari games, Pong and Tennis, the authors demonstrate that eligibility traces improve learning speed and stability, while Adam significantly accelerates learning. Notably, the use of eligibility traces with RNNs achieves near-optimal performance in Tennis, a game where other RL approaches often fail. The paper provides a thoughtful discussion of the experimental results and highlights potential future directions, such as modifying frozen network update frequencies.
Decision: Accept
The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of deep RL by addressing a relatively unexplored area: the combination of eligibility traces and recurrent networks. The experimental results are compelling, demonstrating clear benefits in both learning speed and stability. The work is well-motivated, grounded in the literature, and scientifically rigorous. However, there are areas where the paper could improve, particularly in its clarity and depth of analysis.
Supporting Arguments
1. Novelty and Relevance: The integration of eligibility traces with RNNs in deep RL is novel and addresses important challenges in environments with sparse rewards and partial observability. The paper also highlights the underexplored role of optimizers in RL training, which is a valuable contribution.
2. Experimental Rigor: The experiments are well-designed, with comparisons across multiple configurations (e.g., with and without eligibility traces, using RMSprop vs. Adam). The results are robust and provide strong evidence for the claims made.
3. Impact: The findings have practical implications for improving RL algorithms, particularly in challenging environments like Tennis, where existing methods struggle.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is thorough, it is dense and occasionally difficult to follow. Simplifying the explanation of eligibility traces (e.g., forward vs. backward view) and providing more intuitive examples could make the paper more accessible.
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper mentions that hyperparameters, such as the frozen network update frequency, may limit performance. A more detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity would strengthen the results and provide actionable insights for practitioners.
3. Broader Evaluation: The experiments are limited to two Atari games. Expanding the evaluation to additional games or domains would help generalize the findings and demonstrate broader applicability.
4. Ablation Studies: While the paper compares models with and without eligibility traces, additional ablation studies (e.g., varying 位 values or trace cutoff thresholds) could provide deeper insights into the role of eligibility traces in learning dynamics.
Questions for the Authors
1. How sensitive are the results to the choice of 位 (e.g., 位 = 0.8)? Would smaller or larger 位 values significantly affect the performance?
2. Did you observe any trade-offs between learning speed and stability when using Adam versus RMSprop? Could this be further quantified?
3. Have you considered testing the proposed approach in partially observable environments, where the benefits of RNNs and eligibility traces might be more pronounced?
4. Could the frozen network update frequency be dynamically adjusted during training to balance stability and learning speed?
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field of deep RL, and with minor improvements, it could have even greater impact. I recommend acceptance.
