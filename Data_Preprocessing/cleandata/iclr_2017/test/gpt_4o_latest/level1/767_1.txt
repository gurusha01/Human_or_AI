Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper proposes an innovative approach to automatically learn learning rates for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the authors employ an actor-critic framework, where an actor network determines the learning rate at each step, and a critic network evaluates the long-term impact of these decisions. The method is designed to address the sensitivity of SGD to learning rates, which are typically problem-specific and require manual tuning. The authors demonstrate that their approach improves generalization performance and prevents overfitting, achieving better test accuracy than baseline methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Key contributions include the use of RL for learning rate control, the separation of training examples for the actor and critic networks to enhance generalization, and experimental validation showing competitive convergence speed and improved test accuracy.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, presents a novel application of RL to a significant problem in machine learning, and demonstrates its effectiveness through rigorous experiments. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Relevance: The use of an actor-critic RL framework for learning rate optimization is a fresh and impactful idea, addressing a critical bottleneck in SGD-based training.
2. Empirical Validation: The experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 convincingly demonstrate the method's ability to achieve better generalization and prevent overfitting compared to baseline methods.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem Significance and Motivation: The paper addresses the well-known challenge of learning rate sensitivity in SGD, which is a critical issue in training deep neural networks. The motivation is clear, and the problem is well-situated within the literature, with appropriate comparisons to existing methods such as Adam, RMSprop, and vSGD.
2. Scientific Rigor: The methodology is sound, with a detailed explanation of the actor-critic framework and its integration into SGD. The experiments are well-designed, with comparisons to multiple baselines and ablation studies to validate design choices (e.g., feeding different examples to the actor and critic networks).
3. Results: The proposed method achieves competitive convergence speed and better test accuracy, particularly in preventing overfitting on smaller datasets. The comparison with vSGD further highlights its robustness across different architectures.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong overall, the following points could improve its clarity and impact:
1. Clarity of Methodology: The description of the actor-critic framework, particularly the training process for the actor and critic networks, is dense and could benefit from additional visual aids or pseudocode annotations to improve accessibility for readers unfamiliar with RL.
2. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on SGD, but it would be valuable to discuss how the method could generalize to other optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam or RMSprop). This is mentioned as future work but could be briefly explored in the experiments.
3. Computational Overhead: While the method is promising, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of training the actor and critic networks. A discussion of scalability to larger datasets and models would strengthen the paper.
4. Ablation Studies: The authors mention the importance of feeding different examples to the actor and critic networks but could provide more quantitative results to show how this design choice impacts performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the computational overhead of training the actor and critic networks compare to traditional SGD methods? Is the additional cost justified for larger-scale datasets or models?
2. Have you tested the method on other types of datasets (e.g., text or time-series data) or optimization algorithms beyond SGD? If not, do you anticipate any challenges in applying this approach to these scenarios?
3. Could the proposed method be extended to learn other hyperparameters, such as momentum or weight decay, simultaneously with the learning rate?
Conclusion
This paper introduces a novel and impactful approach to learning rate optimization using RL, with strong experimental validation and clear contributions to the field. While there are areas for improvement, particularly in the clarity of the methodology and computational analysis, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. I recommend acceptance.
