Review of the Paper
This paper proposes the Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) algorithm, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that is stable, sample-efficient, and applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces. The authors introduce three key innovations: truncated importance sampling with bias correction, stochastic dueling network architectures, and an efficient trust region policy optimization method. These innovations are integrated with existing techniques such as the Retrace algorithm and parallel training to address the challenges of sample inefficiency and instability in off-policy learning. The paper demonstrates ACER's effectiveness on the 57-game Atari benchmark and several continuous control tasks, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency and competitive performance.
Decision: Accept
The paper is recommended for acceptance due to its significant contributions to reinforcement learning, particularly in improving sample efficiency and stability for off-policy actor-critic methods. The proposed ACER algorithm is well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated across diverse environments. The innovations introduced are novel and address critical limitations of existing methods, such as A3C and DQN.
Supporting Arguments
1. Problem and Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing challenge of designing sample-efficient and stable actor-critic methods that work across both discrete and continuous action spaces. The motivation is clear and well-supported by references to prior work, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches like A3C and deep Q-learning.
2. Technical Contributions: The proposed innovations—truncated importance sampling with bias correction, stochastic dueling networks, and trust region optimization—are novel and well-integrated into the ACER framework. The theoretical analysis, including the reinterpretation of Retrace as a contraction operator, provides a solid foundation for the algorithm.
3. Empirical Validation: The experimental results are comprehensive and robust. ACER demonstrates superior sample efficiency on Atari games and outperforms baselines on continuous control tasks. The ablation studies further validate the importance of each component of the algorithm.
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity of Presentation: While the paper is technically rigorous, the presentation could be improved for accessibility. For example, the derivation of the trust region optimization method and the stochastic dueling networks could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visual aids.
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: Although the paper includes a sensitivity analysis, the discussion of how hyperparameters like the trust region constraint (δ) and learning rates impact performance could be expanded. This would help practitioners better understand how to tune ACER for their specific use cases.
3. Comparison with Recent Methods: While the paper compares ACER to A3C and DQN, it would be valuable to include comparisons with more recent RL algorithms, such as SAC or PPO, to provide a broader context for ACER's performance.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does ACER perform in environments with sparse rewards or high-dimensional observation spaces, such as those encountered in robotics or real-world applications?
2. Can the proposed trust region optimization method be generalized to other deep learning domains beyond reinforcement learning? If so, what are the potential challenges?
3. How does the computational cost of ACER compare to other state-of-the-art RL methods, particularly in terms of wall-clock time and resource requirements?
By addressing these questions and incorporating the suggested improvements, the paper could further strengthen its impact and utility for the reinforcement learning community.
