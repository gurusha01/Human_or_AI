Review
The paper presents a general "compare-aggregate" framework for sequence matching tasks in natural language processing (NLP), with a particular focus on evaluating different word-level comparison functions. The authors test their model on four datasets—MovieQA, InsuranceQA, WikiQA, and SNLI—spanning tasks such as machine comprehension, answer selection, and textual entailment. The key contributions include demonstrating the generalizability of the "compare-aggregate" framework across multiple tasks and systematically evaluating six comparison functions, including novel element-wise operations like subtraction and multiplication. The results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all datasets, with simple comparison functions (e.g., element-wise operations) often outperforming more complex neural network-based approaches. The authors also provide insights into the importance of preprocessing and attention layers and make their code publicly available, which enhances reproducibility.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, scientifically rigorous, and makes meaningful contributions to the field of NLP. The two primary reasons for acceptance are:  
1. Generalizability and Novelty: The paper convincingly demonstrates that the "compare-aggregate" framework is effective across diverse sequence matching tasks, addressing a gap in prior studies that focused on limited datasets. The systematic evaluation of comparison functions, particularly the success of element-wise operations, is novel and impactful.  
2. Empirical Rigor: The experiments are thorough, with results validated on four datasets and compared against strong baselines. The authors provide detailed ablation studies and analyses, strengthening the validity of their claims.
Supporting Arguments
1. The paper is well-placed in the literature, building on prior work in sequence matching and attention mechanisms while addressing limitations such as the lack of generalizability and insufficient exploration of comparison functions.  
2. The experimental results are robust, with the proposed model outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on three datasets and achieving competitive performance on the fourth. The use of diverse datasets strengthens the claim of general applicability.  
3. The insights into the role of preprocessing and attention layers, as well as the effectiveness of simple comparison functions, are valuable for future research.  
Suggestions for Improvement
1. Clarity in Methodology: While the paper is generally clear, the description of the comparison functions (e.g., SUB, MULT, SUBMULT+NN) could benefit from additional intuition or examples to help readers better understand their differences and implications.  
2. Dataset-Specific Insights: The paper could delve deeper into why certain comparison functions perform better on specific datasets. For example, why does EUCCOS perform well on MovieQA but not on other tasks?  
3. Efficiency Analysis: Since element-wise operations are computationally simpler than neural network-based functions, a discussion on computational efficiency and scalability would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.  
4. Broader Applicability: While the paper focuses on four datasets, it would be helpful to discuss how the framework might generalize to other sequence matching tasks, such as dialogue systems or multi-turn question answering.  
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the model handle cases where sequences are significantly imbalanced in length (e.g., very long passages vs. short questions)? Are there any limitations in such scenarios?  
2. Did you observe any trade-offs between the simplicity of comparison functions (e.g., SUB, MULT) and their ability to capture nuanced semantic relationships?  
3. Could the proposed framework be extended to multi-task learning, as suggested in the conclusion? If so, what challenges do you anticipate?  
Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution to the field and is well-suited for acceptance at the conference.
