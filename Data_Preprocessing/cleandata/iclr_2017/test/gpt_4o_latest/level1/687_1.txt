Review of the Paper
Summary of Contributions
This paper investigates the role of pruning algorithms in understanding the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks. The authors propose a novel pruning algorithm that removes entire neurons from trained networks using a second-order Taylor series approximation of error changes. The paper compares this method to a first-order approximation and a brute-force pruning approach. The authors provide extensive experimental results on toy datasets, MNIST, and regression tasks, demonstrating that up to 40-70% of neurons can be pruned without significant performance degradation. The work also revisits and corroborates earlier hypotheses by Mozer & Smolensky (1989a) regarding the uneven distribution of learned representations across neurons. The paper makes a compelling case for the dualistic roles of neurons in trained networks—either contributing to the learning representation or canceling noise—and highlights the limitations of first- and second-order approximations in pruning decisions.
Decision: Accept
The paper is well-motivated, offers a novel perspective on pruning, and provides rigorous experimental evidence to support its claims. The key reasons for acceptance are:
1. Novelty and Insight: The paper not only introduces a new pruning algorithm but also uses it as a lens to explore fundamental questions about neural network learning representations, providing valuable theoretical insights.
2. Scientific Rigor: The experiments are thorough, and the results are well-analyzed, demonstrating both the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.
Supporting Arguments
1. Motivation and Placement in Literature: The paper is well-grounded in existing literature, building on foundational work by Mozer & Smolensky (1989a) and LeCun et al. (1989). It addresses an important problem—model compression—and connects it to broader questions about neural network learning dynamics.
2. Experimental Validation: The authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures, providing clear evidence for their claims. The use of brute-force pruning as a baseline is particularly commendable, as it highlights the limitations of approximation-based methods.
3. Broader Implications: The findings have practical relevance for memory-constrained environments and theoretical significance for understanding neural network training dynamics.
Suggestions for Improvement
While the paper is strong, there are areas where it could be improved:
1. Computational Feasibility: The brute-force method is computationally expensive, and while the authors suggest parallelization as a potential solution, more concrete proposals or experiments with approximate brute-force methods would strengthen the paper.
2. Clarity in Derivations: The mathematical derivations for the second-order Taylor approximation are relegated to the supplementary material. Including a brief summary in the main paper would improve accessibility.
3. Deeper Networks: The paper primarily focuses on shallow networks (1-2 layers). Extending the experiments to deeper architectures would provide more generalizable insights, especially given the increasing prevalence of deep networks in practice.
4. Comparison with Other Pruning Methods: While the paper compares its approach to first-order and brute-force methods, it would benefit from a comparison with state-of-the-art pruning techniques, such as those leveraging structured sparsity or re-training.
Questions for the Authors
1. How does the proposed method scale to deeper networks with hundreds or thousands of neurons per layer? Are there practical limitations in terms of computational cost or memory usage?
2. Could the second-order Taylor approximation be improved by incorporating off-diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix, or would this be computationally prohibitive?
3. Did the authors observe any patterns in the types of neurons that were pruned (e.g., neurons in specific layers or with certain activation characteristics)?
4. How does the proposed method perform on more complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 or ImageNet) and architectures (e.g., convolutional or transformer networks)?
Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of pruning and learning representations in neural networks. With minor improvements, it has the potential to be a highly impactful work.
