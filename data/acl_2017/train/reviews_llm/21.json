            "comments": "The paper presents a transductive learning approach for hypernym prediction specifically targeting the Chinese language, addressing significant gaps in existing methodologies. Overall, the contributions are substantial, particularly in modeling both positive and negative relationships, incorporating linguistic rules, and leveraging non-linear mappings. \n\n**Contributions:** The paper effectively identifies and addresses three key limitations of existing models for hypernym extraction in Chinese. By incorporating a two-stage transductive learning framework, the authors enhance the prediction of is-a relations while also capturing linguistic regularities. The evaluation shows that their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two public datasets, which is a commendable achievement. \n\n**Clarity:** The paper is well-structured and generally clear, with a logical flow from introduction to conclusion. The methodology is explained in detail, allowing for reproducibility. However, there are areas where the clarity could be improved, specifically regarding the derivation of phrase representations and the relationship between the projection matrices M+ and M-. The authors could provide more detail on how phrases are represented and clarify whether M- is simply a negation of M+. \n\n**Relevance:** The research is highly relevant, particularly in the context of natural language processing for under-resourced languages like Chinese. The focus on hypernym prediction can significantly aid various NLP tasks, and the approach has potential applications that extend beyond Chinese, making the work pertinent to a broader audience.\n\n**Methodology:** The proposed methodology is innovative, combining linear and non-linear learning strategies, along with linguistic rules. However, the paper lacks statistical significance testing for the observed improvements, which would strengthen the claims made. This is a crucial aspect that should be addressed in future iterations of the work.\n\n**Overall Quality:** The overall quality of the paper is high, with thorough related work analysis and strong empirical results. However, addressing the aforementioned questions regarding phrase representation and the relationship between M+ and M- would strengthen the methodology section significantly. Additionally, correcting typographical errors and improving clarity in certain areas would enhance the readability of the paper.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of hypernym prediction for the Chinese language and presents a well-structured methodology. With some minor clarifications and the inclusion of statistical significance testing, it would be an excellent addition to the conference. I recommend accepting the paper with the suggestion for revisions to address the noted concerns."

            "comments": "The paper presents a robust and well-structured approach to hypernym prediction in Chinese, addressing a significant gap in the existing literature. Its contributions are noteworthy, particularly in the context of under-resourced languages. The clarity of the writing is commendable; the introduction provides a solid foundation for understanding the importance of hypernym detection in various NLP tasks, and the related work section extensively situates the proposed method within the broader research landscape.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the paper is its detailed methodology. The two-stage transductive learning approach distinguishes between is-a and not-is-a relations effectively, and the integration of linguistic rules with non-linear mappings offers a novel perspective. However, I do have some questions regarding the methodology. Specifically, while phrases are mentioned in section 3.1, only word representations are discussed. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify how phrase representations are derived and incorporated into the model. Additionally, the relationship between the positive and negative projection matrices (M^+ and M^-) is somewhat ambiguous. The current setup allows for an indirect connection via the tanh scoring function, yet it raises questions about the potential benefits or drawbacks of establishing a direct link between the two matrices to enforce dissimilarity.\n\nThe paper's results are impressive, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods for Chinese hypernym prediction. However, the authors should provide statistical significance for these improvements to bolster their claims further. The inclusion of this information would enhance the robustness of the experimental findings.\n\nIn terms of typographical issues, there are a few minor errors that should be corrected, including the misspelling of 'phrase' in line 220 and awkward phrasing in line 245. Additionally, the phrase \"slightly improvement in F-measure\" in line 587 should be corrected to \"slight improvement in F-measure,\" among other suggested edits.\n\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing, particularly for Chinese hypernym detection. With minor clarifications and corrections, it has the potential to make a significant impact. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."

            "comments": "The paper presents a well-structured and clearly articulated approach to Chinese hypernym prediction, addressing significant challenges in the field. The introduction effectively establishes the relevance of the problem and the importance of accurate hypernym extraction for various NLP tasks. The related work section is comprehensive and thoroughly contextualizes the proposed method within existing literature, demonstrating its novelty and relevance.\n\nThe methodology is robust, employing a two-stage transductive learning approach that combines linear projection models, linguistic rules, and non-linear mappings. However, I have a couple of queries regarding the method's implementation:\n\n1. While phrases are mentioned in Section 3.1, the discussion primarily focuses on word representations. It would be beneficial to clarify how phrase representations are derived within the proposed framework.\n   \n2. The relationship between the matrices M^+ and M^- is not explicitly defined, although they appear to be linked through the tanh scoring function. It would be insightful to explore how these learned matrices compare. For instance, is M^- effectively the negative of M^+? Additionally, discussing the potential benefits and drawbacks of a direct connection between the two matrices could enhance understanding of the model's dynamics.\n\nThe experimental results are compelling, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. However, providing statistical significance for the observed improvements would strengthen the claims made regarding performance enhancements.\n\nTypographical comments for clarity and precision:\n- Line 220: \"word/phase pair\" should be corrected to \"word/phrase pair.\"\n- Line 245: I recommend rephrasing \"entities are translated to\" to \"entities are mapped to\" to avoid confusion regarding the nature of the operation described.\n- Line 587: The phrase \"slightly improvement in F-measure\" should be revised to \"slight improvement in F-measure.\"\n- Line 636: There are extraneous commas in the citation that should be removed for consistency.\n- Line 646: \"The most case\" should likely be revised to \"The most likely case\" for clarity.\n- Line 727: The citation contains an extraneous period and comma that need correction.\n\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of hypernym prediction in Chinese and presents a promising avenue for further research. The clarity, relevance, and thoroughness of the work are commendable, and addressing the aforementioned points would enhance its rigor and impact."
