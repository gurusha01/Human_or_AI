            "comments": "The paper presents a novel architecture for cloze-style reading comprehension tasks, introducing the \"attention-over-attention\" model aimed at improving the interaction between document and query attentions. The contributions of this work are significant, particularly in the context of existing methodologies. The proposed model's ability to dynamically generate \"attended attention\" represents a meaningful advancement over prior models that relied on heuristic merging functions.\n\nThe clarity of the paper is generally good, with a structured approach that clearly delineates the problem, related work, methodology, and experimental results. However, there are moments where the technical language becomes dense, which may alienate readers who are not deeply familiar with the subject matter. A more succinct explanation of some concepts, particularly in sections detailing the architecture and algorithms, could enhance accessibility.\n\nIn terms of relevance, the research addresses a critical area in natural language processing—reading comprehension—and the proposed attention mechanism could have broader implications for various NLP tasks beyond cloze-style challenges. The experiments validate the model's effectiveness, demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art systems across multiple datasets, which underscores the practical relevance of the work.\n\nMethodologically, the paper employs a solid experimental design, utilizing well-known datasets and providing comprehensive comparisons with existing models. The inclusion of an N-best re-ranking strategy adds an interesting dimension to the evaluation, showing that the authors are considering practical applications of their model in real-world scenarios.\n\nOverall, the quality of the paper is high, with well-documented contributions and substantial experimental results. However, it could benefit from minor revisions aimed at enhancing clarity and ensuring that the technical details do not overwhelm the reader. The paper's findings are promising and could lead to future research directions in the field of reading comprehension and beyond."

            "comments": "The paper presents a solid contribution to the field of natural language processing by introducing a novel attention-over-attention model for cloze-style reading comprehension tasks. \n\n**Strengths:**\nThe approach is well-motivated, and the authors provide a thorough description of the proposed model, making it accessible for other researchers to reproduce the results. The architecture builds on existing attention mechanisms and enhances them by introducing a second layer of attention that considers both document-to-query and query-to-document interactions. This is a significant contribution as it addresses limitations in previous models that relied on heuristic merging functions. The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over state-of-the-art systems on benchmark datasets, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nWhile the methodology is sound, there are areas where clarity could be improved. For instance, the notation in Equation 12 could be clearer to avoid confusion regarding the variables involved. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a discussion about the potential advantages of initializing word embeddings with pre-trained vectors like GloVe or Word2Vec, which might enhance performance by leveraging general-purpose semantics.\n\n**General Discussion:**\nThe evaluation is comprehensive, and the authors provide insightful analyses of their results, including comparisons with previous works. Their findings regarding the impact of various features in the N-best re-ranking strategy are particularly noteworthy. The clarity of writing and structure of the paper facilitate understanding, allowing readers to appreciate the significance of the proposed architecture in advancing reading comprehension models.\n\n**Other remarks:**\n1. The paper would benefit from addressing minor typos and grammatical issues to enhance readability.\n2. Clarification is needed on certain points, such as how the model learns the weights between individual attentions and the implications of the higher local LM weight for common nouns despite a lesser overall benefit.\n3. The authors should consider releasing the software alongside the paper to allow for better reproducibility and application of their techniques by the broader research community.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a significant advancement in the field of reading comprehension and offers a clear, well-structured approach that is likely to inspire further research. With minor revisions for clarity and additional details, it would be a strong candidate for acceptance at the conference. Overall, this work is commendable and contributes meaningfully to ongoing discussions in the NLP community."

            "comments": "The paper presents a well-motivated approach to the cloze-style reading comprehension problem through the introduction of a novel neural network architecture called the attention-over-attention (AoA) model. The authors articulate their contributions clearly, highlighting the novelty of their attention mechanism that allows for a mutual evaluation of query and document attentions.\n\n### Contributions\nThe primary contribution of this research lies in its introduction of the attention-over-attention mechanism, which effectively creates an additional layer of attention that evaluates the importance of the original attention scores. This innovation is not only a theoretical advancement but also leads to substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. The paper's empirical evaluation demonstrates that the AoA Reader significantly outperforms its predecessors, indicating the method's effectiveness in capturing the interactive information between queries and documents.\n\n### Clarity\nThe paper is generally well-structured and clear. The introduction provides a solid background on the reading comprehension task, the importance of attention mechanisms, and the limitations of previous approaches. The description of the AoA Reader is detailed and methodical, making it easy for readers to follow the authors’ thought process. However, there are some areas where additional clarification would enhance understanding, such as the specifics of the training process and the implications of the hyperparameters used.\n\n### Relevance\nThis work is highly relevant in the context of natural language processing and reading comprehension, areas that are currently experiencing rapid development and interest. The focus on improving cloze-style comprehension tasks aligns well with ongoing efforts in the field to enhance machine understanding of human language. The paper also addresses practical issues of model complexity and data requirements, which are significant in real-world applications.\n\n### Methodology\nThe methodology is robust, employing well-established practices in neural network training and evaluation. The authors conducted experiments on publicly available datasets, providing a comprehensive comparison with existing models. The introduction of the N-best re-ranking strategy further enriches the methodology, enabling a more nuanced evaluation of candidate answers. However, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the initializations of word embeddings, as this can significantly impact performance.\n\n### Overall Quality\nOverall, the quality of the paper is high. The authors present a solid theoretical underpinning for their approach and back it up with empirical results that demonstrate clear advancements over prior work. Minor issues, such as typographical errors and the need for clarifications on some aspects, do not detract significantly from the paper's overall contribution. The results are well-analyzed, and the insights provided into the performance variations across different tasks and datasets are valuable for future research.\n\n### Other Remarks\n- The paper would benefit from addressing the initialization of word embeddings, possibly by leveraging existing vector representations like GloVe or Google News vectors.\n- Clarifications are needed in certain sections, such as the implications of learning weights between individual attentions and the reasoning behind local LM weight distributions.\n- The authors are encouraged to release their software to facilitate reproducibility and further research in this domain.\n\nIn summary, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of reading comprehension with its innovative approach and thorough evaluation. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the mentioned clarifications and typographical errors."
