The approach of using complex networks enriched with word embeddings for analyzing speech transcripts is novel and promising for the detection of cognitive impairments. The research leverages advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to develop an automated system, which could be highly beneficial for large-scale screening and monitoring of MCI. The use of complex networks allows for a unique perspective in text analysis, potentially capturing linguistic patterns indicative of cognitive decline. Furthermore, the paper is well-structured and includes comprehensive experiments using multiple datasets and a variety of machine learning algorithms, enhancing the robustness of the study.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper could benefit from a clearer distinction between the novel contributions and existing literature. While complex networks have been used in other NLP tasks, the degree to which this methodology advances over previous approaches for MCI detection is not fully articulated. The paper does not discuss the limitations of the datasets used, such as size, demographic diversity, or potential biases. Moreover, the implications of the manual preprocessing required for some datasets are not thoroughly explored. The paper could also improve clarity on how the word embeddings are generated and the impact of using different thresholds for cosine similarity on the results. Lastly, the paper lacks a discussion on the practical implementation of the proposed system, such as integration into clinical workflows and user acceptance.\n\nGeneral discussion:\nThe paper presents an interesting approach that could have a significant impact on the early diagnosis of cognitive impairments. To improve the paper, the authors could emphasize the novelty of their approach in the context of existing literature. A critical analysis of the datasets and preprocessing steps, along with a discussion on potential biases, would make the study more credible. It would also be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis of the word embedding thresholds to understand their effects on the classification performance. Finally, the paper would be strengthened by addressing potential challenges in deploying such a system in clinical settings, including the need for high-quality Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems and the system's adaptability to different languages and dialects.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a promising approach for the automatic detection of MCI using complex networks and word embeddings. With further clarification and expansion on the points mentioned above, the paper could make a substantial contribution to the field of computational health diagnostics.\n"
