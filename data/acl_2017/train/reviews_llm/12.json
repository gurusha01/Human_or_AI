            "comments": "The paper presents a thorough analysis of time expressions in natural language and proposes a novel rule-based approach, SynTime, for their recognition. The contributions of the paper are significant, particularly the observations drawn from the analysis of four datasets that highlight the characteristics of time expressions, which serve as the foundation for the development of SynTime.\n\nIn terms of clarity, the paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the problem, methodology, and results. The introduction succinctly sets the context for time expression recognition, followed by a comprehensive literature review that situates the work within existing research. The methodology section is detailed, explaining the type-based approach and the heuristic rules employed in SynTime, making it easy for readers to understand the innovations compared to previous methods.\n\nThe relevance of this research is high, as time expression recognition is a critical task in natural language processing with implications for various applications, including information retrieval, document understanding, and temporal reasoning. The proposed SynTime system demonstrates clear improvements over state-of-the-art systems, which indicates its practical utility.\n\nThe methodology employed is robust, grounded in both linguistic theory (the principle of least effort and syntactic behavior) and empirical analysis of real-world datasets. The experiments are well-designed, with a clear explanation of the datasets used, evaluation metrics, and a comparison with established baselines. The results presented are compelling, showing that SynTime outperforms existing methods in most cases, particularly in recall, which is crucial for time expression recognition tasks.\n\nOverall, the quality of the paper is high. It successfully combines theoretical insights with practical advancements in the field of time expression recognition.

            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to time expression extraction using a rule-based method called SynTime. It effectively leverages empirical observations about time expressions to propose a syntactic type system and heuristic rules that improve upon existing methods. \n\n**Contributions:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of time expression recognition by introducing a type-based tagger that simplifies rule-based approaches. It not only provides a robust analysis of time expressions across various datasets but also demonstrates the effectiveness of SynTime through extensive experimentation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in several metrics. The insights about time expressions being short and containing at least one time token are particularly valuable for future research in this area.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is well-written and logically structured. Each section clearly builds on the previous one, making it easy for readers to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology. The introduction sets up the problem effectively, and the related work provides a good context for the contributions of SynTime.\n\n**Relevance:** The research is highly relevant to the areas of natural language processing and information retrieval. Given the increasing importance of temporal information in various applications, the findings and methods proposed in this paper are timely and significant for both academic and practical applications.\n\n**Methodology:** The methodology is sound, with a strong empirical basis for the proposed rules and types. However, some aspects of the methodology could benefit from further specification. For instance, while the paper mentions that SynTime is initialized using regular expressions from existing taggers, it does not provide enough detail for replication. Specifically, the choice of types, such as the definition of \"5 seasons\" and how specific cultural references (like Ramadan) are handled, lacks clarity. Additionally, the paper should address how the system plans to improve beyond the current performance levels, especially given the high recall achieved.\n\n**Overall Quality:** Overall, the quality of the research is high, with a strong foundation in empirical data and a clear presentation of the results. However, concerns about reproducibility due to underspecified methods and the need for clearer examples diminish the overall impact of the work. The authors should consider releasing the full set of rules or software used to further enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of their findings.\n\nIn summary, while there are areas for improvement, particularly concerning methodological clarity and reproducibility, the paper presents a significant advancement in time expression extraction, making it a valuable contribution to the field. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to address the noted weaknesses.",

            "comments": "The paper presents a novel rule-based approach to time expression extraction, named SynTime, which is built on empirical observations about the characteristics of time expressions in natural language. The authors articulate key insights: time expressions are typically short and contain at least one time token. The methodology is well-structured, involving the recognition of time tokens through dictionary lookups, regular expression matching, and POS tagging, followed by the expansion of time segments and their subsequent merging into coherent time expressions.\n\nThe strengths of the paper include its clarity and logical presentation. The empirical observations that motivate the design of the SynTime rules are compelling and well justified by the experimental results, which demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art systems, both rule-based and machine learning-based. The experimental setup is thorough, employing three different datasets and clearly delineating the performance of SynTime against its competitors.\n\nHowever, the paper is not without weaknesses. There are aspects that are underspecified, which could hinder reproducibility. For instance, the definition of types in Section 4.1 raises questions about the categorization of time units, such as the mention of \"5 seasons\" without further clarification. Additionally, there is a need for clearer communication regarding the datasets used in Section 5.1, where it should refer to three datasets rather than two. The performance evaluation in Section 5.2 could benefit from illustrative examples, particularly ones that do not contain time tokens, to better explain the system's functionality. Furthermore, while the results are impressive, the authors should address how they plan to improve the system beyond the current performance ceiling, given that the majority of time expressions contain time tokens. Lastly, it would be beneficial to know if there are plans to release the full set of rules and the software used for this research.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper offers valuable contributions to the field of time expression recognition in natural language processing. Its innovative approach, combined with solid empirical backing, makes it a significant addition to the literature, despite the noted areas for improvement in clarity and reproducibility.",

            "comments": "This paper presents a robust rule-based approach for time expression extraction, addressing a crucial aspect of natural language processing. The authors provide compelling insights into the characteristics of time expressions, notably their brevity and the prevalence of time tokens. The methodology, which involves recognizing time tokens through a combination of dictionary lookups, regular expression matching, and POS tagging, is both innovative and well-founded in empirical data. The expansion of time segments using heuristic rules and the subsequent merging of these segments into cohesive time expressions demonstrate a thoughtful design that effectively captures the nuances of language.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\nThe paper is well-written and clearly presented, which enhances its accessibility to readers. The rules established for time expression extraction are motivated by empirical observations from the datasets, providing a strong justification for the chosen methodology. The experimental evaluations against both rule-based and machine learning-based systems across three datasets underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing significant improvements in performance.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nHowever, there are some aspects of the paper that require clarification to facilitate reproducibility. \n\n1. **Section 4.1:** The mention of \"five seasons\" is unclear. The authors should elaborate on this classification and consider including examples of unique time periods such as Ramadan or the Holiday Season, which may not fit traditional seasonal definitions.\n   \n2. **Section 5.1:** The statement regarding \"two benchmark datasets\" should be corrected to reflect that the evaluation encompasses three datasets, ensuring consistency and clarity in the methodology description.\n\n3. **Section 5.2:** Providing an example of a time expression that lacks a time token would be beneficial for illustrating the limitations of the system.\n\n4. **Further Improvement:** Given that the proposed approach is close to the performance ceiling (with 93% of expressions containing time tokens and the system achieving 92% recall), the authors should discuss their plans for further improvement and potential avenues for enhancing the model's performance.\n\n5. **Software and Rules Release:** It would be advantageous for the authors to consider releasing the complete set of rules and software utilized in their study to promote transparency and facilitate further research in this area.\n\n**General Discussion:**\n\nOverall, the paper offers valuable contributions to the field of time expression recognition in natural language processing. With some revisions and additional clarifications, it has the potential to significantly impact future research and applications in this domain.",
