The primary strengths of the paper are:\n\n1. Novelty: Introduction of a hard attention model that directly models nearly-monotonic alignment between input and output character sequences, which is particularly relevant for morphological inflection tasks.\n2. Methodology: The use of independently learned character-level alignments to guide the encoder-decoder network training, which simplifies the learning process and seems to provide a solid grounding for the hard attention mechanism.\n3. Experimental Evaluation: Comprehensive experiments on three morphological inflection generation datasets (CELEX, Wiktionary, SIGMORPHON2016) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model relative to existing neural and non-neural baselines.\n4. Results: The model is shown to perform on par or better than state-of-the-art approaches and performs significantly better with very small training sets, highlighting its robustness and efficiency.\n5. Analysis: The paper provides an insightful analysis comparing the hard attention model to the soft attention model, shedding light on how the models learn and function.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nDespite the strengths, there are some areas where the paper could be improved:\n\n1. Clarity: While the paper is generally well-written, the description of the model and the training procedure might benefit from additional clarity and detail, particularly for readers who may not be as familiar with hard attention mechanisms.\n2. Reproducibility: Although the source code is mentioned to be available, the paper itself could benefit from more detailed implementation specifics to aid in reproducibility.\n3. Impact: While the paper shows impressive results on the tested datasets, it would be beneficial to discuss potential limitations or challenges in applying the model to other morphologically rich languages that weren't part of the experiments.\n4. Broader Applicability: The paper focuses on morphological inflection generation; however, insights into how the proposed model might be adapted or extended to other sequence-to-sequence tasks would enhance its significance.\n\n**General Discussion:**\n\nThe paper presents promising results, and the proposed model could significantly contribute to advancements in handling morphologically rich languages in NLP tasks. For future work, it would be interesting to see how the model adapts to languages with non-monotonic morphological processes and how it can be applied to other NLP tasks that involve sequence-to-sequence learning. Furthermore, a deeper exploration into how the learned representations and alignments correlate with linguistic properties could provide valuable insights into the interpretability of neural models in morphological tasks.\n\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of morphological inflection generation and the broader NLP community.\n\n"
