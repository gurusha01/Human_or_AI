            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to zero pronoun (ZP) resolution by addressing the challenges associated with the lack of annotated training data. The authors propose an innovative method for generating large-scale pseudo training data inspired by cloze-style reading comprehension tasks, and they introduce a two-step training process that combines this pseudo data with task-specific data. \n\n**Contributions**: The paper makes significant contributions to the field by being the first to apply reading comprehension neural network models to zero pronoun resolution. The two-step training method and the attention-based neural network model are key innovations that demonstrate improved performance over previous methods. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of their approach, highlighting the effectiveness of their methods through empirical results.\n\n**Clarity**: The paper is generally well-organized and clearly written, with a logical flow from the introduction to the experiments and results. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, allowing readers to understand and replicate the approach. Figures and tables are used effectively to illustrate key concepts and results, although some sections could benefit from more concise explanations to enhance readability.\n\n**Relevance**: The topic is highly relevant to the fields of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, particularly in understanding and resolving anaphora and coreference issues. The challenge of ZP resolution, especially in languages like Chinese, makes this research pertinent for both academic and practical applications in language technologies.\n\n**Methodology**: The methodology is robust, employing a combination of data generation techniques and a well-defined neural network architecture. The use of attention mechanisms and a two-step training process is well-justified and supported by experimental results. However, the paper could include more discussion on potential limitations of the approach and the generalizability of the results across different languages and contexts.\n\n**Overall Quality**: Overall, the paper presents a strong contribution to the field. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the proposed techniques are well-supported by the data. Future work is outlined, indicating a direction for further research. Minor improvements in clarity and a more thorough discussion of limitations could enhance the paper's impact.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper represents a meaningful advancement in zero pronoun resolution, and I recommend it for acceptance at the conference, with suggestions for minor revisions to improve clarity and depth of discussion regarding limitations and future directions."

            "comments": "The paper presents a compelling contribution to the field of zero pronoun resolution by introducing a novel method for generating large-scale pseudo training data and employing a two-step training approach that effectively bridges the gap between this data and task-specific datasets. The authors successfully adapt techniques from cloze-style reading comprehension to address the challenges associated with the lack of annotated data in this area, making a significant step forward in the development of zero pronoun resolution models.\n\nStrengths: \n1. **Innovative Data Generation**: The approach for automatically generating pseudo training data is straightforward yet effective, leveraging existing documents to create a substantial dataset that can enhance model training.\n2. **Two-Step Learning Process**: The proposed pre-training and adaptation method is a strong contribution, as it demonstrates how to effectively transfer knowledge from a large dataset to improve performance on a specific domain. This methodology may have broader implications for other NLP tasks as well.\n3. **Handling Unknown Words**: The differentiation of unknown words using unique tags is a creative solution to a common problem in NLP, allowing for better tracking of these words during processing.\n\nThe clarity of the paper is commendable; the writing is generally clear and well-structured, making it accessible to readers. The experimental design is thorough, with adequate detail provided on datasets, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Results are presented compellingly, showing significant improvements over existing methods.\n\nWeaknesses: \nHowever, there are a few areas that require further clarification:\n1. **Antecedent Identification**: The method for identifying antecedents when the prediction is a pronoun needs elaboration. Specifically, how does the model handle cases where the predicted antecedent is not a pronoun? The proposed matching of noun phrase heads could present issues when the head is not a pronoun.\n2. **Handling Predictions**: The approach for predictions that yield nouns not present in the prior context is unclear. This could lead to ambiguity in the resolution process.\n3. **Evaluation in Two Steps**: While the paper achieves impressive results on standard datasets, it would be beneficial to evaluate the model in two distinct steps: first on the recovery of the zero pronoun and then on the identification of its antecedent. This could provide a clearer picture of the model's performance in real-world scenarios.\n4. **Justification for Neural Network Choice**: The authors could provide additional rationale for their choice of an attention-based neural network. A brief discussion of its advantages in this context would be helpful for other researchers considering similar approaches.\n\nA minor comment: In Figure 2, it would be more intuitive to label the sequence as s1, s2, etc., instead of d1, d2, which may cause confusion.\n\nGeneral Discussion: \nOverall, this paper showcases innovative ideas and a solid experimental setup, making it a valuable contribution to the field of zero pronoun resolution. Addressing the highlighted weaknesses, particularly regarding antecedent identification and evaluation methodologies, would strengthen the paper further. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions."

Its primary contributions include a novel method for automatically generating large-scale pseudo training data, a two-step training process that bridges the gap between this pseudo data and task-specific data, and an innovative handling of unknown words by differentiating them with unique tags. \n\nThe clarity of the paper is commendable; it is well-structured, with sections clearly delineating the proposed approach, methodology, and experimental results. The experimental design is thorough, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods against established baselines, which strengthens the credibility of the findings.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the proposed method could benefit from further elucidation. For instance, the mechanism for identifying antecedents when the prediction is a pronoun remains ambiguous. The authors suggest matching the head of noun phrases but do not clarify how to approach scenarios where the head word is not a pronoun. Additionally, the paper does not address how to handle cases where the predicted noun does not match any previously mentioned content. A two-step evaluation process, separating the recovery of the zero pronoun and the identification of its antecedent, could provide deeper insights into model performance.\n\nThe rationale behind the choice of an attention-based neural network could be expanded. Providing a few sentences to justify this choice would offer valuable context for readers and researchers looking to understand the underlying decision-making process.\n\nMinor issues, such as the labeling in Figure 2, where 's1, s2...' would be more appropriate than 'd1, d2...', should also be addressed for accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, this research paper is a significant contribution to the field of zero pronoun resolution, showcasing innovative ideas and a solid experimental framework. Addressing the aforementioned concerns would enhance its overall quality and clarity."

            "comments": "This paper presents a novel method aimed at enhancing zero pronoun resolution performance. The key contributions of this work are as follows: 1) it introduces a straightforward approach for automatically generating a large training dataset specifically for the zero pronoun resolution task; 2) it applies a two-step learning process that effectively transfers knowledge from a large dataset to task-specific data; and 3) it innovatively differentiates unknown words using distinct tags. Overall, the paper is well-articulated, and the experimental design is thorough and methodical.\n\nHowever, there are several questions regarding the identification of antecedents for zero pronouns that need to be addressed: 1) How does the system identify an antecedent when the predicted output is a pronoun? The authors suggest matching the head of noun phrases, but clarity is needed on how cases are handled when the head word is not a pronoun. 2) What happens if the predicted noun does not appear in the preceding context? 3) While the system demonstrates impressive results on standard datasets, I am interested in whether it would be feasible to evaluate the system in two stages: the first to assess the model's ability to recover the missing zero pronoun as a word, and the second to evaluate its effectiveness in identifying an antecedent.\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial for the authors to briefly explain their choice of using an attention-based neural network, as providing this rationale could assist other researchers in understanding their model selection.\n\nOn a minor note, in Figure 2, it may be more appropriate to label the sequences as s1, s2, etc., rather than d1, d2, etc.\n\nIn summary, this paper is commendable for its innovative ideas and robust experimental setup, making it a valuable contribution to the field."
