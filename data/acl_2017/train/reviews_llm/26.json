            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to knowledge base question answering (KB-QA) using a cross-attention mechanism that captures the relationships between different aspects of candidate answers and the words in the input question. The contributions are significant, particularly in how the model dynamically adjusts question representations based on the relevant answer aspects, and in leveraging global knowledge from the KB to improve performance.\n\nIn terms of clarity, while the high-level concepts are presented well, certain sections lack sufficient detail, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the background to fully grasp the methodology. For instance, the context aspect of candidate answers is not clearly defined, and the explanation of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue is quite brief, assuming prior knowledge that may not be common among all readers.\n\nThe relevance of this work is evident, as it addresses the growing need for effective question-answering systems that can handle the complexities of natural language queries against large knowledge bases. The methodology, which combines neural network techniques with attention mechanisms, is well-justified and seems to provide a meaningful improvement over previous methods.\n\nThe experimental validation is robust, comparing the proposed approach against various state-of-the-art systems. However, the rationale behind including certain comparisons, especially with the SP-based systems, could be clearer. It would also be beneficial for the authors to discuss the potential impact of using pre-trained embeddings versus random initialization on performance, as this could influence the generalizability of the model.\n\nOverall, the paper has substantial merit and presents a promising direction for further research in the field of KB-QA. The idea of including structured queries as an additional aspect in future iterations of the model is intriguing and could enhance the model's capabilities. Despite some areas needing clarification, the contributions of this work are valuable, and it successfully advances the state of the art in question answering over knowledge bases.",

            "comments": "This paper presents an innovative approach for factoid question answering over a knowledge graph (Freebase) by employing a neural model that learns semantic correlations between various aspects of candidate answers (such as answer type, relation to the question entity, and semantic representation) and relevant words from the question. The two primary contributions of this work are: (1) the development of distinct components designed to capture different aspects of candidate answers, moving away from a single semantic representation, and (2) the incorporation of global context from the knowledge base to enhance the representation of candidate answers.\n\nA particularly intriguing aspect of this work is the separation of candidate answer representation into distinct aspects. This approach provides neural model developers with enhanced control over guiding neural networks towards information that could improve decision-making, reminiscent of traditional algorithms that rely on feature engineering. However, the feature engineering in this case is more nuanced and less burdensome, which is commendable. I encourage the authors to continue refining this system along these lines for greater effectiveness.\n\nWhile the overarching idea is relatively clear to an informed reader, the intricate details may pose challenges for some audience members in grasping the key insights of this work. Certain sections of the paper could benefit from additional clarification. Specifically:\n\n1. The context aspect of candidate answers (denoted as \\(e_c\\)) is not thoroughly explained, making the last two sentences of Section 3.2.2 unclear.\n   \n2. The discussion on the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue in the abstract and introduction requires further elaboration, as the current exposition presupposes a deep understanding of prior work by the reader.\n\n3. The experimental comparisons are limited to information retrieval (IR)-based systems, which is a reasonable decision; however, the inclusion of Yang et al. (2014), which is described as SP-based, raises questions. There seems to be inconsistency regarding what should be compared, and mentioning the performance metrics of the leading SP-based systems could enhance the paper.\n\nAdditionally, I noted that the embeddings in this paper are learned exclusively from the training data. It would be beneficial to explore the impact of the random initialization of these embeddings on the final performance, including any variance observed. Furthermore, examining the potential effects of using pre-trained embeddings (e.g., from word2vec) instead of random initialization could yield interesting insights.\n\nA potential direction for future work could involve integrating structured queries from SP-based methods into the cross-attention mechanism. This could entail using various aspects of candidate answers as features while also incorporating structured queries that generate the candidate answer. An attention mechanism could then focus on different parts of the structured query and its semantic matches to the input question, providing an additional signal for the neural network model.\n\nRegarding the positioning of the paper, I hesitate to classify the proposed model strictly as an \"attention\" model. My understanding is that attention mechanisms typically apply to encoder-decoder scenarios, where semantics from one structured form are encoded into an abstract representation and then generated into another structured form. This paper, however, does not appear to fit that framework, which may lead to confusion among a broader audience.\n\nOverall, the paper presents valuable contributions to the field of knowledge base question answering, and with some clarifications and enhancements, it has the potential to make an even greater impact.",
