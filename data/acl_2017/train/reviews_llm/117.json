The authors propose a novel hierarchical matching approach with residual learning that matches questions to both word-level and relation-level representations of KB relations. This approach is designed to cope with issues related to unseen relations, zero-shot learning, and the prediction of relation chains. The use of deep bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) and a hierarchical residual matching technique shows innovation in handling the complexity of the task. Additionally, the paper proposes a simple KBQA implementation that leverages the improved relation detection model, which demonstrates state-of-the-art results on both single-relation and multi-relation KBQA tasks according to the experiments reported.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations and potential biases of the proposed methods. Although the authors mention the challenges of KB relation detection, they do not provide an extensive analysis of cases where their model may fail or underperform. Moreover, the paper focuses heavily on the methodology and the benefits of the proposed approach, but it does not thoroughly discuss alternative approaches or justify why the selected methods are superior to other potential solutions. There is also a lack of clarity on the computational efficiency of the model and its scalability to larger datasets or more complex KB structures.\n\n### General Discussion:\n\nThe paper could be improved by expanding the related work section to offer a broader perspective on how the proposed approach compares to existing techniques, as well as discussing the implications of the proposed method on the broader NLP and AI communities. The authors should also consider adding a discussion about the potential impact of their work on real-world applications and how it can be integrated into existing KBQA systems. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include a sensitivity analysis of the model's performance with respect to the choice of hyperparameters and dataset characteristics. Finally, the paper should address the reproducibility of the results by providing access to the code, datasets, and a clear explanation of the experimental setup.\n\n"
