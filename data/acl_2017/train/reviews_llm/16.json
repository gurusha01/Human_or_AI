            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to event detection (ED) by explicitly leveraging argument information through supervised attention mechanisms. While the motivation behind the research is sound, focusing on the often-ignored annotated arguments during ED, the paper could improve in several areas.\n\n**Contributions:** The contributions of the paper are significant, primarily by highlighting the importance of argument information in ED tasks. The introduction of supervised attention mechanisms to guide the model towards relevant argument words represents a valuable advancement over existing methods. Furthermore, the paper's empirical results, demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art methods, bolster the claim of its effectiveness.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is generally well-structured and clear in its presentation. The introduction effectively outlines the problem statement and the motivation for the proposed approach. However, there are instances where the language could be simplified for better comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the nuances of event extraction. Technical details, particularly in the methodology section, are thorough but may overwhelm readers due to the heavy use of jargon.\n\n**Relevance:** The topic is highly relevant in the field of natural language processing and AI, especially given the growing interest in event extraction tasks in various applications. The focus on enhancing ED through the utilization of argument information addresses a gap in existing research, making it a timely contribution to the field.\n\n**Methodology:** The methodology is robust and well-articulated. The authors employ a neural network framework and detail the construction of gold attention vectors, which is a novel approach. However, the paper lacks a detailed discussion on the potential limitations of the proposed method, such as the reliance on annotated datasets and the implications of data sparseness on model performance. It would be beneficial to include more qualitative analyses of the model's behavior in ambiguous cases.\n\n**Overall Quality:** Overall, the quality of the paper is high, with a clear focus on addressing a pertinent issue in event detection. The experimental results are compelling and provide a strong basis for the claims made by the authors. However, the paper would benefit from additional context regarding the limitations of the study, and suggestions for future work could enhance its contribution. \n\nIn summary, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of event detection by emphasizing the role of argument information and introducing supervised attention mechanisms. With minor improvements in clarity and a more thorough discussion of limitations, it has the potential to make a significant impact on the research community."

            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to event detection (ED) by explicitly incorporating argument information using a supervised attention mechanism. This addresses a notable gap in existing methods that often ignore event arguments, despite their potential significance in disambiguating event triggers. The authors rightly argue that arguments can provide crucial context, particularly for ambiguous trigger words, and their empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.\n\nThe clarity of the paper is commendable. The authors provide a well-structured introduction that clearly outlines the problem and their contributions. The methodology is described in sufficient detail, making it easy for readers to understand the proposed approach and how it builds upon previous work. The systematic experimentation on the ACE 2005 dataset is thorough, with clear comparisons drawn between their method and existing techniques, which enhances the validity of their findings.\n\nIn terms of relevance, the work is timely and significant, as event detection remains an important task in natural language processing (NLP). By focusing on the integration of argument information, the study pushes the boundaries of traditional approaches and opens avenues for future research in ED and related fields.\n\nHowever, there are some weaknesses worth noting. While the summation of the two attention vectors (contextual words and entities) is straightforward, it may not fully capture the complexities of their interactions. More sophisticated strategies for combining these vectors could yield even better results. Additionally, the two proposed strategies for constructing gold attention vectors are simplistic, and exploring more advanced methods could enhance the robustness of the attention mechanism.\n\nOverall, despite these areas for improvement, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by presenting an effective framework that leverages previously underutilized information. The experimental results are solid, and the performance improvements are compelling. Considering its strengths and the potential for further refinement, I recommend this paper for acceptance at the conference."

            "comments": "This paper presents a novel approach to event detection (ED) by leveraging annotated argument information, which is often overlooked in existing methods. The authors argue convincingly that event arguments can provide crucial context for accurately identifying and classifying ambiguous event triggers. The proposed supervised attention mechanism effectively integrates these arguments into the ED process, demonstrating substantial improvements over baseline models and state-of-the-art methods on the ACE 2005 dataset. \n\nThe strengths of this paper lie in its clear articulation of the problem, a well-structured approach, and the empirical results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The framework is straightforward yet powerful, and the use of supervised attention is a compelling enhancement to traditional ED techniques. The experiments are thorough, providing comprehensive comparisons with previous models, which strengthens the authors' claims about the advantages of their approach.\n\nHowever, there are notable weaknesses. The construction of the attention vector, which is a simple summation of two separate attention vectors, may not fully capture the complexities of the relationships between trigger candidates and arguments. Additionally, while the two proposed strategies for constructing gold attention vectors are functional, they are somewhat simplistic. Exploring more sophisticated attention mechanisms could yield even better results and would enhance the robustness of the framework.\n\nOverall, despite these weaknesses, the contributions of this paper are significant, particularly in the context of improving ED by utilizing argument information. The methodology is sound, the relevance to the field is high, and the results are compelling. This paper should be considered for acceptance at the conference, as it offers valuable insights and advancements in event extraction tasks within natural language processing. The authors are encouraged to explore more complex strategies for attention in future work to further improve their model's performance."

            "comments": "This paper presents a novel approach that effectively utilizes argument information to enhance event detection, a typically overlooked aspect in prior research. The clarity and simplicity of the proposed framework are commendable, and the implementation of a supervised attention mechanism—a technique successfully applied in various tasks such as machine translation—significantly improves the performance of the system compared to baseline models.\n\nHowever, there are areas for potential improvement. The attention vector is currently derived from a straightforward summation of two individual attention vectors, which may not be the most effective approach. Additionally, while the two proposed strategies for constructing the supervised attention vectors are practical, they could benefit from more sophisticated methodologies that might yield better results.\n\nOverall, despite some minor weaknesses, the paper introduces an effective framework with solid experimental validation and impressive performance metrics. It warrants consideration for acceptance at the conference."
