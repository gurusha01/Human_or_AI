            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing word embeddings by incorporating n-grams into existing representation methods such as SGNS, GloVe, and PPMI. The contributions of this research are significant in the context of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in improving the quality of word representations used in various downstream tasks.\n\nThe clarity of the paper is commendable, with a well-structured presentation that guides the reader through the motivation, methodology, and experimental results. The introduction effectively sets the stage by discussing the limitations of current methods and justifying the need for n-gram integration. The related work section provides a thorough overview of existing models, establishing a solid foundation for the proposed contributions.\n\nThe relevance of this research is substantial, especially as the field of NLP continues to evolve with the increasing importance of nuanced language understanding. By demonstrating the effectiveness of n-grams in enhancing representation quality, the paper addresses a critical area of interest for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nMethodologically, the paper employs a comprehensive experimental framework, evaluating the proposed n-gram-based models on multiple datasets for both analogy and similarity tasks. The results indicate a marked improvement in performance when using n-grams, especially in the SGNS model. Additionally, the authors propose an innovative method for building co-occurrence matrices that optimizes computational efficiency, which is a practical contribution to the field.\n\nOverall, the quality of the paper is high. It combines theoretical insights with practical implementation details, making it a valuable addition to the literature on word embeddings. The findings are backed by rigorous experimentation, and the qualitative evaluations further substantiate the claims made by the authors. The release of the ngram2vec toolkit adds an element of reproducibility and accessibility to the research.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of NLP by proposing a novel approach to word embeddings that leverages n-gram statistics. It is well-written, relevant, and methodologically sound, warranting acceptance at the conference. I recommend the paper for publication.",

            "comments": "The paper presents a valuable extension of existing word embedding methods by introducing n-gram based co-occurrence statistics. This approach significantly enhances the complexity and potential of traditional models like SGNS and GloVe, demonstrating promising results in similarity and analogy tasks. The methodology is well-articulated, and the experimental results support the claim that n-grams can lead to improved embeddings that reflect semantic and syntactic relationships. One notable strength is the proposed efficient method for building co-occurrence matrices, which mitigates the computational burden associated with handling n-grams.\n\nHowever, the paper lacks experiments that apply these embeddings to real-world NLP tasks, which would strengthen the argument for their practical utility. The authors should consider exploring such applications in future work to better demonstrate the embeddings' effectiveness in broader contexts.\n\nOverall, despite this limitation, the paper provides relevant contributions to the field of NLP and deep learning, and it is a valuable addition to the conference proceedings. Its clarity and thoroughness in methodology and experimental design make it suitable for presentation at ACL.",

            "comments": "The paper presents a compelling extension of existing word embedding methods by incorporating n-gram statistics into their frameworks. The introduction of n-grams addresses a significant gap in the current literature regarding the use of richer linguistic structures, thereby enhancing the semantic and syntactic understanding of word representations. The methodology is well-structured, offering a clear explanation of how n-grams are integrated into popular models like SGNS, GloVe, and PPMI, along with a novel approach for co-occurrence matrix construction that optimizes computational efficiency.\n\nThe experimental results are robust, demonstrating significant improvements in performance on analogy and similarity tasks, which adds credibility to the proposed method. The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers, even those who may not be experts in the field.\n\nHowever, a notable weakness is the lack of experiments on real-world NLP tasks where the embeddings could be applied. Such experiments would provide further validation of the embeddings' utility beyond theoretical evaluations, enhancing the paper's impact.\n\nOverall, despite this limitation, the contributions of this work are relevant and significant. It opens new avenues for research in word representation and could inspire future studies that leverage n-gram embeddings in practical applications. Thus, I believe this paper should be accepted at ACL as it provides valuable insights and methodologies that advance the state of the art in NLP.",

            "comments": "This paper presents a significant extension of well-established methods for learning vector representations of text, such as skip-gram with negative sampling, GloVe, and other PMI-based approaches. While these original methods rely solely on word co-occurrence statistics, this study innovatively incorporates n-gram based statistics, which enhances the complexity of the algorithms due to the increased vocabulary size and context space. The authors effectively introduce a method for learning embeddings for n-grams with corresponding n-gram contexts, optimizing the computation of these embeddings. The experimental results on similarity and analogy tasks are compelling and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nHowever, a notable limitation is the lack of experiments involving real-world tasks that utilize these embeddings as input, beyond the scope of the presented similarity and analogy tasks. Such experiments could have strengthened the paper's contributions and practical relevance.\n\nIn general, despite this weakness, I believe this is a valuable paper to include at ACL, as it offers new insights and methodologies for enhancing word representation models through the integration of n-gram statistics.",
