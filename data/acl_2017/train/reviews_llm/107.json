This is particularly important given the time and cost involved in creating such datasets. The authors' approach to leveraging existing resources in a source language to extend to other languages is both practical and innovative. The proposed methods, including heuristic data selection for annotation projection and direct model transfer via representation projection, are well-motivated and represent meaningful contributions to the field. The use of co-decoding schemes to combine different system outputs is a clever technique that potentially improves performance over individual systems. The empirical results showing improvements over state-of-the-art approaches are compelling, and the paper provides a thorough evaluation on multiple languages and datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the methodologies, making it more accessible to readers who are not experts in this specific sub-field. While the results are strong, it is not clear how the proposed methods would scale to languages with significantly different structures or those with limited digital resources. The paper might also improve by discussing the limitations of the proposed approaches, such as potential biases introduced by the source language NER systems or the alignment models. Another potential weakness is the lack of discussion on the impact of the quality of word embeddings on the performance of the representation projection method.\n\nGeneral discussion:\nThe paper is an important step toward developing NER systems that can be effectively applied to multiple languages with minimal annotated data. Future work could explore the scalability of these methods to a wider array of languages and possibly look into unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches to further reduce the dependency on annotated data. It would also be interesting to see if the methodologies could be adapted to work with other NLP tasks that require entity understanding. Overall, the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of cross-lingual NER, and the paper is likely to inspire further research in this area.\n\n"
