            "comments": "The paper presents a compelling approach to learning semantic hierarchies through the innovative fusion of discriminative and generative models, enhanced by a simple lexical structure rule. The contributions are significant, particularly in addressing the challenges of hypernym-hyponym relation discovery without the need for extensive background knowledge, making it applicable across languages.\n\nClarity is a key strength of the paper. The authors provide a structured layout, clearly defining concepts, methodologies, and results. The figures and tables effectively illustrate the proposed architectures and experimental outcomes, making complex ideas more accessible.\n\nThe relevance of the research is notable, as semantic hierarchies are critical in various natural language processing applications. The study addresses the limitations of existing methods, particularly the reliance on manual resources and the challenges of context usage.\n\nThe methodology is robust, integrating established models like MLP and RNN while introducing a fusion approach that balances precision and recall. The experimental setup is well-detailed, with appropriate metrics and rigorous comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.\n\nHowever, while the results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of potential limitations and future work. For instance, exploring the implications of the lexical structure rule in more detail or addressing scenarios where the model may struggle would strengthen the overall analysis.\n\nOverall, this research provides a valuable contribution to the field of semantic hierarchy learning, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods. The novel fusion architecture and its language-independent nature present exciting avenues for further exploration. I recommend acceptance with suggestions for clarifying the limitations and potential applications of the proposed method.",

            "comments": "The paper presents a method for learning semantic hierarchies using a fusion of generative and discriminative architectures, which is a relevant and significant contribution to the field of natural language processing. The strengths of the paper include its focus on an important issue, the clarity of the proposed methods, and detailed experimental setups which demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. However, the paper suffers from several weaknesses, particularly in its evaluation and overall presentation.\n\nFirstly, while the methods employed are sensible, the evaluation of the proposed approach lacks rigor. The list of baselines is confusing, with outdated methods included without justification, and there is insufficient context provided for the current state-of-the-art method, referred to as MEmb. The paper does not adequately clarify how MEmb compares to other methods, particularly in terms of numerical results, which diminishes the impact of the claimed improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the writing quality is subpar, with numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the text. This significantly detracts from the paper's professionalism and readability. For instance, the mention of 11 errors in the first column of page 2 alone indicates a need for thorough proofreading before publication.\n\nThe evaluation dataset, CilinE, is noted to have a shallow hierarchy of only five levels, which raises concerns about the validity of the results and the difficulty of discovering new relations in such a limited structure. This might explain the high performance metrics achieved, which, while impressive, may not be indicative of the method's effectiveness in more complex scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, while the approach is innovative in applying deep learning techniques to semantic hierarchy construction, the paper requires substantial revisions, particularly in presentation and evaluation methodology, to convincingly demonstrate its contributions to the field. Addressing these issues would enhance the paper's overall quality and credibility. Therefore, further work is needed before this paper can be considered for publication.",

            "comments": "The paper addresses the important issue of building ontologies and semantic thesauri, a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP). The authors propose a novel fusion architecture that combines generative and discriminative models to improve the discovery of hypernym-hyponym relations. The methodology appears sound, leveraging word embeddings and a simple lexical structure rule, and is well-detailed in terms of setup and implementation.\n\nThe experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves an F1-score of 74.20%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods, particularly in terms of precision (91.60%). This suggests a significant contribution to the field, particularly in a language-independent context.\n\nHowever, several weaknesses detract from the overall quality of the paper. The evaluation section lacks clarity, as the list of baseline methods is convoluted, including some outdated approaches that do not seem justified. Additionally, the paper does not adequately reference the previous state-of-the-art approach (MEmb), leaving readers unclear about its performance and relevance. The differences in performance between the proposed method and existing approaches, particularly in the first dataset, are minimal and do not convincingly demonstrate substantial improvement.\n\nMoreover, the paper suffers from numerous typographical and grammatical errors that undermine its professionalism. These issues need to be rectified before publication, as they disrupt the flow of reading and detract from the authors' credibility. The evaluation of the shallow CilinE hierarchy, while acknowledged as a limitation, could benefit from further discussion on its implications for the results obtained.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to a novel application of deep learning in the construction of semantic hierarchies, the issues with presentation and evaluation need to be addressed comprehensively. A more detailed justification for the baseline methods, along with clearer performance comparisons and significance tests, is essential to enhance the paper's persuasive power. Overall, I find the contributions worthy of consideration, but substantial revisions are necessary for clarity and rigor.",

            "comments": "The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of ontology construction and semantic hierarchy learning, addressing an important problem in natural language processing. The proposed methods are logically sound and well-justified, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to leveraging word embeddings and fusion architectures. The detailed explanation of methodologies and experimental setups is commendable, providing clarity on the processes involved.\n\nHowever, several critical weaknesses hinder the overall presentation and impact of the paper. Firstly, the evaluation section lacks clarity and justification for the choice of baseline methods. Some older methods included in the comparison, such as Mpattern, seem outdated and their relevance is not adequately explained. Moreover, while the paper claims to outperform the previous state-of-the-art approach, known as MEmb, there is insufficient context provided regarding its performance or a proper citation for it. This lack of clarity raises questions about the robustness of the claims made.\n\nAdditionally, the writing quality throughout the paper requires substantial improvement. Numerous typos and grammatical errors detract from the overall readability and professionalism of the work. For instance, eleven errors were noted in the first column of page two alone, indicating a need for thorough proofreading before publication.\n\nAnother point of concern is the shallow depth of the CilinE hierarchy, which only extends to five levels. Although this dataset has been used by previous authors, the limited complexity may explain the high performance metrics reported, potentially skewing the results.\n\nIn summary, while the paper addresses a novel application of deep learning techniques to a previously underexplored area, it suffers from significant presentation issues and a lack of convincing evaluation. Improvements in writing quality and a more comprehensive evaluation section, including clearer definitions of baseline methods and significance testing, are essential for the paper to meet publication standards. Overall, the paper shows promise but requires refinement to fully convey its contributions and significance to the field.",
