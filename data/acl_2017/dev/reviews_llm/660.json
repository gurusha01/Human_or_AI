            "comments": "The paper presents a comprehensive review of the challenges and methodologies for automatic poetry generation. It discusses the limitations of existing approaches and proposes two novel methodologies for solving the task. The paper provides detailed explanations of the phonetic-level model and the constrained character-level model, along with their training processes and output examples. It also includes an intrinsic evaluation of the models' ability to generate formulaic poetry and an extrinsic evaluation where human annotators compare the generated poetry to human-generated poetry. The results of the evaluation show that the generated poetry is indistinguishable from human poetry, and in some cases, even outperforms human poetry in terms of quality."
