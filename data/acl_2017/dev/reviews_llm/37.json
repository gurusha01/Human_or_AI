            "comments": "The paper presents a new context-based model for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots. The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public data sets and is shown to provide a better experience than a state-of-the-art generation model in practice. Additionally, the paper publishes the first human-labeled multi-turn response selection data set to research communities."
