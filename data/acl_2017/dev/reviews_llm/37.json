            "comments": "The paper presents a novel approach for multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots through the introduction of a Sequential Matching Network (SMN). The authors effectively address the challenges of maintaining context across multiple turns while ensuring that important information is preserved during response selection. The contributions of the paper are significant, including the development of a new model, the introduction of a human-labeled dataset, and empirical evidence showcasing the model's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. \n\nThe clarity of the paper is commendable, with a logical structure that guides the reader through the introduction of the problem, the proposed solution, and the experimental validation. The mathematical formulations and descriptions of the model's architecture are detailed and provide a solid understanding of the methodology. However, there are some linguistic issues and minor errors in figure captions that could be refined for better readability.\n\nIn terms of relevance, the paper addresses a critical area in conversational AI, particularly the need for effective multi-turn response selection, which is crucial for developing more sophisticated chatbots. The proposed SMN model is relevant in the context of ongoing research in natural language processing and dialogue systems.\n\nThe methodology is robust, with a comprehensive evaluation using two datasets, including the introduction of a new human-labeled dataset, Douban Conversation Corpus. The authors provide thorough comparisons with various baseline models, demonstrating the efficacy of their approach. However, the results of the side-by-side human comparison against a state-of-the-art generation model could be further elaborated to provide more insight into the qualitative aspects of the model's performance.\n\nOverall, the paper is of high quality, making valuable contributions to the field of conversational agents. It could benefit from minor revisions to improve clarity in tables and figures, ensure clear definitions of variables, and provide additional statistical support for claims made throughout the text. Once these issues are addressed, the paper will be a strong candidate for publication in the conference."

            "comments": "The paper presents a comprehensive and well-structured approach to multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based chatbots through the introduction of a Sequential Matching Network (SMN). \n\n**Contributions**: The primary contributions of this paper are significant. Firstly, it introduces a novel context-based matching model that addresses the complexities of multi-turn conversations, distinguishing itself from existing models that primarily focus on single-turn interactions. Secondly, the authors release the Douban Conversation Corpus, the first human-labeled dataset for multi-turn response selection, which is a valuable resource for the research community. Lastly, the empirical results demonstrate that SMN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the Ubuntu and Douban datasets, validating its effectiveness.\n\n**Clarity**: The paper generally maintains clarity in its exposition. The introduction succinctly outlines the problem and sets the stage for the proposed solution. However, some sections, particularly in the methodology, could benefit from clearer explanations, especially regarding the GRU mechanism and the convolutional operations. More intuitive descriptions or illustrations could enhance the reader's understanding.\n\n**Mathematical Description**: The mathematical formulations are well-presented and mostly clear, though certain equations could benefit from additional context or explanations. For instance, while the definitions of the similarity matrices (M1 and M2) are mathematically sound, elaborating on the significance of these matrices in the context of the overall model would aid comprehension.\n\n**Comparison to Alternatives**: The paper effectively compares SMN to a range of baseline models, including both basic and advanced methods. The discussion of results is thorough, demonstrating a clear understanding of how the proposed model improves upon existing approaches. However, a deeper analysis of why specific baselines performed poorly could provide further insights into the advantages of SMN.\n\n**Results Evaluation**: The results are well-presented, with clear metrics and statistical significance testing. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and metrics, supporting their claims of improved performance. However, the paper could strengthen its results section by including more detailed discussions on edge cases or scenarios where SMN may not perform as well.\n\n**Terminology Confusion**: The terminology used in the paper is generally consistent, but there are instances where terms could be better defined or contextualized, particularly for readers less familiar with the nuances of dialogue systems and multi-turn conversations.\n\n**Statistical Significance**: The authors appropriately conduct statistical significance tests (t-tests) for their results, which adds credibility to their claims. This is a positive aspect as it demonstrates a rigorous approach to evaluating their findings.\n\n**Readability Issues**: Overall, the paper is readable, though some sentences are complex and lengthy, which may hinder understanding. Simplifying some of the more intricate descriptions and ensuring that each section has clear transitions could improve the flow of the paper.\n\n**Spelling and Grammar**: The paper is largely free from spelling and grammatical errors, although minor issues in sentence structure can be found. A thorough proofreading could enhance the overall quality of the writing.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a valuable and innovative approach to multi-turn response selection in chatbots with significant empirical support. With some improvements in clarity, particularly in the methodology and results sections, it has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of conversational agents. I recommend acceptance with minor revisions to enhance clarity and readability."
