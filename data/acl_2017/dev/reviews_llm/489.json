            "comments": "The paper presents a comprehensive review and analysis of different models of referential word meaning, focusing on the combination of visual information and distributional knowledge. It discusses the limitations of cross-modal mapping models and the benefits of treating words as individual predictors linked to a distributional space. The paper also presents experimental results on standard and zero-shot object naming tasks, highlighting the performance differences between the models and their effectiveness in capturing referential word meaning."
