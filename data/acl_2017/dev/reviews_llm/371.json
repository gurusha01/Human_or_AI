            "comments": "The paper presents a novel phrasal recurrent neural network (pRNN) model that explicitly models task-specific nested phrases from plain text. The model does not require human-labeled data or external resources and outperforms state-of-the-art LSTM language models in language modeling and machine translation tasks."
