            "comments": "The paper presents a comprehensive review of the use of word embeddings for document analysis and introduces a nonparametric clustering framework for document analysis. The framework is shown to be computationally feasible, robust, and to outperform other popular methods in various clustering tasks. The paper also discusses the sensitivity of clustering methods to hyperparameters and the potential benefits of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into word embeddings. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the use of word embeddings for document analysis and offers a practical and effective clustering framework."
