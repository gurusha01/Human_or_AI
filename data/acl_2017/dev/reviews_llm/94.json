            "comments": "The paper presents a novel non-monotonic variant of the non-projective Covington parser, trained with a dynamic oracle. It introduces three different loss expressions that closely bound the loss and enable the implementation of a practical non-monotonic dynamic oracle. The non-monotonic algorithm outperforms the monotonic version on average, and one of the loss expressions shows promising results, despite being the farthest approximation from the actual loss. This is the first implementation of non-monotonicity for a non-projective parsing algorithm and the first approximate dynamic oracle that uses close, efficiently-computable approximations of the loss."
