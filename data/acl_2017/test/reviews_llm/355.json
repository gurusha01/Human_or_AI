It proposes a novel neural model that uses grid-type recurrent neural networks (Grid-RNNs) to capture multi-predicate interactions without relying on syntactic information. The authors present a basic model using RNNs for independent estimation of arguments and extend it to a Grid-RNN model for joint estimation. Experiments on the NAIST Text Corpus show that their approach outperforms the state-of-the-art Japanese PAS analyzer.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The paper tackles a significant problem in semantic analysis for pro-drop languages, which is crucial for natural language understanding.\n2. The proposed neural models, particularly the Grid-RNN, are innovative and represent a novel approach to modeling multi-predicate interactions.\n3. The authors provide a thorough experimental evaluation, demonstrating that their models outperform existing state-of-the-art systems.\n4. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of the methodology and the significance of the work.\n5. The authors make their source code publicly available, which is beneficial for reproducibility and further research.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential scalability issues or performance on more diverse datasets.\n2. While the results are impressive, the paper does not provide a detailed error analysis that could offer insights into the types of errors the model is prone to.\n3. The paper focuses on Japanese PAS analysis, and it is not clear how well the proposed approach generalizes to other pro-drop languages.\n\n**Questions and Suggestions:**\n1. Can the authors provide insights into how the model performs on longer sentences or more complex sentence structures?\n2. It would be helpful to see a comparison with other pro-drop languages to understand the generalizability of the approach.\n3. A detailed error analysis could be beneficial for understanding the model's limitations and guiding future improvements.\n\n**Evaluation of Specific Aspects:**\n- **Novelty and Originality:** The use of Grid-RNNs for capturing multi-predicate interactions is a novel contribution to the field.\n- **Technical Soundness:** The methodology appears sound, and the experiments are well-designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models.\n- **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is well-written and organized, with clear figures and tables that aid in understanding the proposed approach.\n- **Reproducibility:** The authors have made the source code available, which is a strong point in favor of reproducibility.\n- **Impact:** The work has the potential to significantly impact the field of semantic analysis for pro-drop languages and could influence future research in this area.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nI recommend acceptance of this paper. The authors present a significant contribution to the field of semantic analysis for pro-drop languages, with a novel neural model that effectively captures multi-predicate interactions. The experimental results are convincing, and the paper is well-written and clear. Future work could explore the generalizability of the approach to other languages and provide a more detailed error analysis.\n\n"
