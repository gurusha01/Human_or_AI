            "comments": "Summary:\nThe paper presents a novel approach to neural machine translation (NMT) by incorporating chunk information into the decoding process. The authors propose three models that aim to improve translation performance by capturing the hierarchical structure of sentences, which consists of chunks and words. The models are evaluated on the WAT ’16 English-to-Japanese translation task, with the best model outperforming the best single NMT model reported in WAT ’16.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper addresses a significant problem in NMT, namely the difficulty of capturing long-distance dependencies and handling free word-order languages.\n2. The proposed models are novel and represent a meaningful advancement over the standard sequential decoder by introducing chunk-level information.\n3. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the models, showing clear improvements over the baseline and previous work in terms of BLEU and RIBES scores.\n4. The methodology is sound, with a clear explanation of the chunk-based approach and the hierarchical structure of the proposed models.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed models and potential areas for improvement.\n2. While the results are promising, the paper does not provide an extensive comparison with other state-of-the-art models beyond those reported in WAT ’16.\n3. The paper focuses on Japanese as the target language, and it is unclear how well the proposed models would generalize to other languages with different linguistic properties.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions:\n1. Can the authors discuss the potential limitations of their approach and how they might be addressed in future work?\n2. It would be beneficial to see a comparison with other state-of-the-art models not included in WAT ’16 to better understand the models' performance relative to the current research landscape.\n3. The authors mention future work on applying the method to other languages. Can they provide preliminary insights or expectations on how the models might perform with languages that have different chunk structures?\n\nEvaluate Specific Aspects:\nNovelty and Originality: The paper presents a novel approach to NMT by incorporating chunk information, which is a significant contribution to the field.\nTechnical Soundness: The methodology appears to be technically sound, with a clear explanation of the models and the rationale behind them.\nClarity and Presentation: The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with informative figures that aid in understanding the proposed models.\nReproducibility: The paper provides sufficient detail for the work to be replicated, although the availability of datasets and code is not explicitly mentioned.\nImpact: The proposed models have the potential to significantly impact the field of NMT, especially for languages with free word order and complex sentence structures.\n\nOverall, the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful approach to improving NMT. The authors should consider addressing the questions and suggestions to further strengthen the paper."
