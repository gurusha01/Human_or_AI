It builds upon the entity grid model, incorporating long-range entity transitions and entity-specific features. The model is trained end-to-end on tasks such as discrimination, insertion, and summary coherence rating, outperforming non-neural counterparts.\n\nStrengths:\n- The paper addresses a significant problem in text generation and summarization, which is the assessment of text coherence.\n- The proposed neural architecture is novel, extending the entity grid model to capture long-range dependencies and entity-specific features.\n- The methodology is sound, with a clear explanation of the neural network layers and the pairwise training method.\n- The paper presents a thorough evaluation, showing consistent improvements over existing models on multiple tasks.\n- The authors have made their code available, which is beneficial for reproducibility and further research.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the proposed model, especially in comparison to other neural approaches.\n- While the model outperforms existing methods, the improvements are incremental in some tasks, which may warrant further investigation into the model's capabilities.\n- The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the model or its scalability to larger datasets.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions:\n- Can the authors provide more insight into the model's performance on different types of texts, such as informal or conversational data?\n- It would be helpful to see a comparison with other recent neural approaches to text coherence, to better understand the model's position in the current research landscape.\n- A discussion on how the model could be adapted or extended to handle multimodal data (e.g., text with images) would be interesting.\n\nEvaluate Specific Aspects:\n- Novelty and Originality: The paper presents a novel approach to modeling text coherence using a neural network, advancing the state of the art.\n- Technical Soundness: The methodology is technically sound, with a clear description of the model architecture and training process.\n- Clarity and Presentation: The paper is well-written and structured, with clear figures and tables that aid in understanding the proposed model.\n- Reproducibility: The authors provide code with their submission, which is a strong point for reproducibility.\n- Impact: The proposed model has the potential to impact various applications in natural language processing, such as text generation and summarization.\n\nOverall, the paper is a valuable contribution to the field of text coherence modeling. The authors should consider addressing the mentioned weaknesses and questions to further strengthen the paper.\n\n"
