            "comments": "Summary:\nThe paper addresses the challenge of causality classification in natural language processing, focusing on the disambiguation of causal meaning between two events. The authors propose a neural network architecture that utilizes LSTM RNNs to encode the context of the events and a set of dense layers to classify the causal relationship. They evaluate their model on the AltLex corpus, comparing it to baselines and the state-of-the-art system by Hidey and McKeown (2016).\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper tackles an important problem in computational linguistics, which is the identification and classification of causal relations in text.\n2. The proposed neural network architecture is novel and well-suited for the task, as it leverages LSTM RNNs to capture the sequential nature of language and the context surrounding causal events.\n3. The authors provide a thorough evaluation of their system, using different configurations and comparing it to existing baselines and state-of-the-art methods.\n4. The results show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of precision and achieves a good balance between precision and recall, indicating effective learning of causal meanings.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential biases in the training data and the generalizability of the model to other datasets or languages.\n2. While the authors mention the lack of resources as a problem, they do not provide a clear plan for how they will address this in their future work, such as specific strategies for corpus creation or expansion.\n\nQuestions and Suggestions:\n1. Can the authors elaborate on how their model would perform on a more diverse set of texts, or texts from different domains?\n2. It would be interesting to see a more detailed analysis of the errors made by the model to understand where it struggles and how it might be improved.\n3. The authors should consider providing more information on how they plan to create a new corpus for causality classification, including the sources of texts and the annotation process.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of computational linguistics with its neural network approach to causality classification. The methodology is sound, and the results are promising. However, further work is needed to ensure the robustness and applicability of the proposed system across different contexts and languages."
