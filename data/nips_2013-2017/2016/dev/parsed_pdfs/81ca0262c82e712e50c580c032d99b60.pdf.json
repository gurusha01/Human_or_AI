      "text" : "A wide variety of research disciplines, including computer science, economic, biology and social science, involve causality analysis of a network of interacting random processes. In particular, many of those tasks are closely related to subset selection. For example, in sensor network applications, with limited budget it is necessary to place sensors at information “sources” that provide the best observability of the system. To better predict a stock under consideration, investors need to select causal covariates from a pool of candidate information streams. We refer to the first type of problems as “causal sensor placement”, and the second one as “causal covariate selection”.\nTo solve the aforementioned problems we firstly need a causality measure for multiple random processes. In literature, there exists two types of causality definitions, one is related with time series prediction (called Granger-type causality) and another with counter-factuals [18]. We focus on Granger-type prediction causality substantiated with Directed Information (DI), a tool from information theory. Recently, a large body of work has successfully employed DI in many research fields, including influence mining in gene networks [14], causal relationship inference in neural spike train recordings [19], and message transmission analysis in social media [23]. Compared to modelbased or testing-based methods such as [2][21], DI is not limited by model assumptions and can naturally capture non-linear and non-stationary dependence among random processes. In addition, it has clear information theoretical interpretation and admits well-established estimation techniques. In this regards, we formulate causal sensor placement and covariate selection into cardinality constrained directed information maximizations problems.\nWe then need an efficient algorithm that makes optimal subset selection. Although subset selection, in general, is not tractable due to its combinatorial nature, the study of greedy heuristics for submodular objectives has shown promising results in both theory and practice. To list a few, following the pioneering work [8] that proves the near optimal 1− 1/e guarantee, [12] [1] investigates the submod-\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nularity of mutual information under Gaussian assumption, and then uses a greedy algorithm for sensor placement. In the context of speech and Nature Language Processing (NLP), the authors of and [13] adopt submodular objectives that encourage small vocabulary subset and broad coverage, and then proceed to maximization with a modified greedy method. In [3], the authors combine insights from spectral theory and submodularity analysis of R2 score, and their result remarkably explains the near optimal performance of forward regression and orthogonal matching pursuit.\nIn this work, we also attack the causal subset selection problem via submodularity analysis. We show that the objective function of causal sensor placement, i.e., DI from selected set to its complement, is submodular, although not monotonic. And the problem of causal covariates selection, i.e., DI from selected set to some target process, is not submodular in general but is “nearly” submodular in particular cases. Since classic results require strictly submodularity and monotonicity which cannot be established for our purpose, we propose a novel measure of the degree of submodularity and show that, the performance guarantee of greedy algorithms can be obtained for possibly non-monotonic and non-submodular functions. Our contributions are: (1) Two important causal subset selection objectives are formulated with directed information and the corresponding submodularity analysis are conducted. (2) The SmI dependent performance bound implies that submodularity is better characterized by a continuous indicator than being used as a “yes or no” property, which extends the application of greedy algorithms to a much broader class of problems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In next section, we briefly review the notion of directed information and submodular function. Section 3 is devoted to problem formulation and submodularity analysis. In section 4, we introduce SmI and provides theoretical results on performance guarantee of random and deterministic greedy algorithms. Finally in Section 5, we conduct experiments to justify our theoretical findings and illustrate a causal structure learning application."

      "text" : "Directed Information Consider two random process Xn and Y n, we use the convention that Xi = {X0, X1, ...Xi}, with t = 0, 1, ..., n as the time index. Directed Information from Xn to Y n is defined in terms of mutual information:\nI(Xn → Y n) = n∑ t=1 I(Xt;Yt|Y t−1) (1)\nwhich can be viewed as the aggregated dependence between the history of process X and the current value of process Y , given past observations of Y . The above definition captures a natural intuition about causal relationship, i.e., the unique information Xt has on Yt, when the past of Y t−1 is known.\nWith causally conditioned entropy defined by H(Y n||Xn) , ∑n t=1H(Yt|Y t−1, Xt), the directed information from Xn to Y n when causally conditioned on the series Zn can be written as\nI(Xn → Y n||Zn) = H(Y n||Zn)−H(Y n||Xn, Zn) = n∑ t=1 I(Xt;Yt|Y t−1, Zt) (2)\nObserve that causally conditioned directed information is expressed as the difference between two causally conditioned entropy, which can be considered as “causal uncertainty reduction”. With this interpretation one is able to relate directed information to Granger Causality. Denote X̄ as the complement of X in a a universal set V , then,\nTheorem 1 [20] With log loss, I(Xn → Y n||X̄t) is precisely the value of the side information (expected cumulative reduction in loss) thatX has, when sequentially predicting Y with the knowledge of X̄ . The predictors are distributions with minimal expected loss.\nIn particular, with linear models directed information is equivalent to Granger causality for jointly Gaussian processes.\nSubmodular Function There are three equivalent definitions of submodular functions, and each of them reveals a distinct character of submodularity, a diminishing return property that universally exists in economics, game theory and network systems.\nDefinition 1 A submodular funciton is a set function f : 2Ω → R, which satisfies one of the three equivalent definitions: (1) For every S, T ⊆ Ω with S ⊆ T , and every x ∈ Ω \\ T , we have that\nf (S ∪ {x})− f(S) ≥ f (T ∪ {x})− f(T ) (3) (2) For every S, T ⊆ Ω, we have that\nf(S) + f(T ) ≥ f(S ∪ T ) + f(S ∩ T ) (4) (3) For every S ⊆ Ω, and x1, x2 ∈ Ω \\ S, we have that\nf (S ∪ {x1}) + f (S ∪ {x2}) ≥ f (S ∪ {x1, x2}) + f(S) (5)\nA set function f is called supermodular if −f is submodular. The first definition is directly related to the diminishing return property. The second definition is better understood with the classic max k-cover problem [4]. The third definition indicates that the contribution of two elements is maximized when they are added individually to the base set. Throughout this paper, we will denote fx(S) , f (S ∪ x)− f(S) as the “first order derivative” of f at base set S for further analysis."

      "text" : "In this section, we first formulate two typical subset selection problems into cardinality constrained directed information maximization. Then we address the issues of submodularity and monotonicity in details. All proofs involved in this and the other sections, are given in supplementary material.\nCausal Sensor Placement and Covariates Selection by Maximizing DI To motivate the first formulation, imagine we are interested in placing sensors to monitor pollution particles in a vast region. Ideally, we would like to put k sensors, which is a given budget, at pollution sources to better predict the particle dynamics for other areas of interest. As such, the placement locations can be obtained by maximizing the directed information from selected location set S to its complement S (in the universal set V that contains all candidate sites). Then this type of “causal sensor placement” problems can be written as\nargmax S⊆V,|S|≤k\nI(Sn → Sn) (OPT1)\nRegarding the causal covariates selection problem, the goal is to choose a subset S from a universal set V , such that S has maximal prediction causality to a (or several) target process Y . To leverage sparsity, the cardinality constraints |S| ≤ k is also imposed on the number of selected covariates. Again with directed information, this type of subset selection problems reads\nargmax S⊆V,|S|≤k\nI(Sn → Y n) (OPT2)\nThe above two optimizations are hard even in the most reduced cases: Consider a collection of causally independent Gaussian processes, then the above problems are equivalent to the D-optimal design problem, which has been shown to be NP-hard [11]. Unless “P = NP”, it is unlikely to find any polynomial algorithm for the maximization, and a resort to tractable approximations is necessary.\nSubmodularity Analysis of the Two Objectives Fortunately, we can show that the objective function of OPT1, the directed information from selected processes to unselected ones, is submodular.\nTheorem 2 The objective I(Sn → S̄n) as a function of S ⊆ V is submodular.\nThe problem is that OPT1 is not monotonic for all S, which can be seen since both I(∅ → V ) and I(V → ∅) are 0 by definition. On the other hand, the deterministic greedy algorithm has guaranteed performance only when the objective function is monotonic up to 2k elements. In literature, several works have been addressing the issue of maximizing non-monotonic submodular function [6][7][17]. In this work we mainly analysis the random greedy technique proposed in [17], which is simpler compared to other alternatives and achieves best-known guarantees.\nConcerning the second objective OPT2, we make a slight detour and take a look at the property of its “first derivative”.\nProposition 1 fx(S) = I(Sn ∪ xn → Y n)− I(Sn → Y n) = I(xn → Y n||Sn)\nThus, the derivative is the directed information from processes x to Y causally conditioned on S. By the first definition of submodularity, if the derivative is decreasing in S, i.e. if fx(S) ≥ fx(T ) for any S ⊆ T ⊆ V and x ⊆ V \\ T , then the objective I(Sn → Y n) is a submodular function. Intuition may suggest this is true since knowing more (conditioning on a larger set) seems to reduce the dependence (and also the causality) of two phenomena under consideration. However, in general, this conjecture is not correct, and a counterexample could be constructed by having “explaining away” processes. Hence the difficulty encountered for solved OPT2 is that the objective is not submodular. Note that with some extra conditional independence assumptions we can justify its submodularity,\nProposition 2 If for any two processes s1, s2 ∈ S, we have the conditional independence that (s1t ⊥⊥ s2t | Yt), then I(Sn → Y n) is a monotonic submodular function of set S.\nIn practice, the assumption made in the above proposition is hard to check. Yet one may wonder that if the conditional dependence is weak or sparse, possibly a greedy selection still works to some extent because the submodularity is not severely deteriorated. Extending this idea we propose Submodularity Index (SmI), a novel measure of the degree of submodularity for general set functions, and we will provide the performance guarantee of greedy algorithms as a function of SmI."

      "heading" : "4 Submodularity Index and Performance Guarantee",
      "text" : "For the ease of notation, we use f to denote a general set function and treat directed information objectives as special realizations. It’s worth mentioning that in literature, several effort has already been made to characterize approximate submodularity, such as the ε relaxation of definition (3) proposed in [5] for a dictionary selection objective, and the submodular ratio proposed in [3]. Compared to existing works, the SmI suggested in this work (1) is more generally defined for all set functions, (2) does not presume monotonicity, and (3) is more suitable for tasks involving information, influence, and coverage metrics in terms of computational convenience.\nSmI Definition and its Properties We start by defining the local submodular index for a function f at location A for a candidate set S\nϕf (S,A) , ∑ x∈S fx(A)− fS(A) (6)\nwhich can be considered as an extension of the third definition (5) of submodularity. In essence, it captures the difference between the sum of individual effect and aggregated effect on the first derivative of the function. Moreover, it has the following property:\nProposition 3 For a given submodular function f , the local submodular index ϕf (S,A) is a supermodular function of S.\nNow we define SmI by minimizing over set variables:\nDefinition 2 For a set function f : 2V → R the submodularity index (SmI) for a location set L and a cardinality k, denoted by λf (L, k), is defined as\nλf (L, k) , min A⊆L\nS∩A=∅, |S|≤k\nϕf (S,A) (7)\nThus, SmI is the smallest possible value of local submodularity indexes subject to |S| ≤ k. Note that we implicitly assume |S| ≥ 2 in the above definition, as in the cases where |S| = {0, 1}, SmI reduces to 0. Besides, the definition of submodularity can be alternatively posed with SmI,\nLemma 1 A set function f is submodular if and only if λf (L, k) ≥ 0, ∀ L ⊆ V and k.\nFor functions that are already submodular, SmI measures how strong the submodularity is. We call a function super-submodular if its SmI is strictly larger than zero. On the other hand for functions that are not submodular, SmI provides an indicator of how close the function is to submodular. We call a function quasi-submodular if it has a negative but close to zero SmI.\nDirect computation of SmI by solving (7) is hard. For the purpose of obtaining performance guarantee, however, a lower bound of SmI is sufficient and is much easier to compute. Consider the objective of (OPT1), which is already a submodular function. By using proposition 3, we conclude that its local submodular index is a super-modular function for fixed location set. Hence computing (7) becomes a cardinality constrained supermodular minimization problem for each location set. Besides, the following decomposition is useful to avoid extra work on directed information estimation:\nProposition 4 The local submodular index of the function I({•}n → {V \\ •}n) can be decomposed as ϕI({•}n→{V \\•}n)(Sn, An) = ϕH({V \\•}n)(Sn, An) + ∑n t=1 ϕH({•}|V t−1)(St, At), where H(•) is the entropy function.\nThe lower bound of SmI for the objective of OPT2 is more involved. With some work on an alternative representation of causally conditioned directed information, we obtain that\nLemma 2 For any location sets L ⊆ V , cardinality k, and target process set Y , we have\nλI({•}n→Y n)(L, k) ≥ min W⊆V\n|W |≤|L|+k\nn∑ t=1 { G|L|+k ( W t, Y t−1 ) − G|L|+k ( W t, Y t )} (8)\n≥ − max W⊆V\n|W |≤|L|+k\nI(Wn → Y n) ≥ −I(V n → Y n) (9)\nwhere the function Gk(W,Z) , ∑ w∈W H(w|Z)− kH(W |Z) is super-modular of W .\nSince (8) is in fact minimizing (maximizing) the difference of two supermodular (submodular) functions, one can use existing approximate or exact algorithms [10] [16] to compute the lower bound. (9) is often a weak lower bound, although is much easier to compute.\nRandom Greedy Algorithm and Performance Bound with SmI With the introduction of SmI, in this subsection, we analyze the performance of the random greedy algorithm for maximizing non-monotonic, quasi- or super-submodular function in a unified framework. The results broaden the theoretical guarantee for a much richer class of functions.\nAlgorithm 1 Random Greedy for Subset Selection S0 ← φ for i = 1, ..., k do Mi = argmaxMi⊆V \\Si−1,|Mi|=k ∑ u∈Mi fu(Si)\nDraw ui uniformly from Mi Si ← Si−1 ∪ {ui}\nend for\nThe randomized greedy algorithm was recently proposed in [17] [22] for maximizing cardinality constrained non-monotonic submodular functions. Also in [17], a 1/e expected performance bound was provided. The overall procedure is summarized in algorithm 1 for reference. Note that the random greedy algorithm only requires O(k|V |) calls of the function evaluation, making it suitable for large-scale problems.\nIn order to analyze the performance of the algorithm, we start with two lemmas that reveal more properties of SmI. The first lemma shows that the monotonicity of the first derivative of a general set function f could be controlled by its SmI.\nLemma 3 Given a set function f : V → R, and the corresponding SmI λf (L, k) defined in (7), and also let set B = A ∪ {y1, ..., yM} and x ∈ B . For an ordering {j1, ..., jM}, define Bm = A ∪ {yj1 , ..., yjm}, B0 = A, BM = B, we have\nfx(A)− fx(B) ≥ max {j1,...,jM} M−1∑ m=0 λf (Bm, 2) ≥Mλf (B, 2) (10)\nEssentially, the above result implies that as long as SmI can be lower bounded by some small negative number, the submodularity (the decreasing derivative property (3) in Definition 1) is not severely degraded. The second lemma provides an SmI dependent bound on the expected value of a function with random arguments.\nLemma 4 Let the set function f : V → R be quasi submodular with λf (L, k) ≤ 0. Also let S(p) a random subset of S, with each element appears in S(p) with probability at most p, then we have E [f(S(p))] ≥ (1− p1)f(∅) + γS,p, with γS,p , ∑|S| i=1(i− 1)pλf (Si, 2).\nNow we present the main theory and provide refined bounds for two different cases when the function is monotonic (but not necessarily submodular) or submodular (but not necessarily monotonic).\nTheorem 3 For a general (possibly non-monotonic, non-submodular) functions f , let the optimal solution of the cardinality constrained maximization be denoted as S∗, and the solution of random greedy algorithm be Sg then\nE [f(Sg)] ≥\n( 1\ne + ξfSg,k E[f (Sg)]\n) f(S∗)\nwhere ξfSg,k = λf (Sg, k) + k(k−1) 2 min{λf (Sg, 2), 0}.\nThe role of SmI in determining the performance of the random greedy algorithm is revealed: the bound consist of 1/e ≈ 0.3679 plus a term as a function of SmI. If SmI = 0, the 1/e bound in previous literature is recovered. For super-submodular functions, as SmI is strictly larger than zero, the theorem provides a stronger guarantee by incorporating SmI. For quasi-submodular functions having negative SmI, although a degraded guarantee is produced, the bound is only slightly deteriorated when SmI is close to zero. In short, the above theorem not only encompasses existing results as special cases, but also suggests that we should view submodularity and monotonicity as a “continuous” property of set functions. Besides, greedy heuristics should not be restricted to the maximization of submodular functions, but can also be applied for “quasi-submodular” functions because a near optimal solution is still achievable theoretically. As such, we can formally define quasi-submodular functions as those having an SmI such that ξfS,k\nE[f(S)] > − 1 e .\nCorollary 1 For monotonic functions in general, random greedy algorithm achieves\nE [f(Sg)] ≥ (\n1− 1 e\n+ λ′f (S g, k)\nE [f(Sg)]\n) f(S∗)\nand deterministic greedy algorithm also achieves f(Sg) ≥ (\n1− 1e + λ′f (S g,k) f(Sg)\n) f(S∗), where\nλ′f (S g, k) =\n{ λf (S\ng, k) if λf (Sg, k) < 0 (1− 1/e)2λf (Sg, k) if λf (Sg, k) ≥ 0 .\nWe see that in the monotonic case, we get a stronger bound for submodular functions compared to the 1− 1/e ≈ 0.6321 guarantee. Similarly, for quasi-submodular functions, the guarantee is degraded but not too much if SmD is close to 0. Note that the objective function of OPT2 fits into this category. For submodular but non-monotonic functions, e.g., the objective function of OPT1, we have\nCorollary 2 For submodular function that are not necessarily monotonic, random greedy algorithm has performance\nE [f(Sg)] ≥ ( 1\ne + λf (S\ng, k)\nE [f(Sg)]\n) f(S∗)"

      "heading" : "5 Experiment and Applications",
      "text" : "In this section, we conduct experiments to verify the theoretical results, and provide an example that uses subset selection for causal structure learning.\nData and Setup The synthesis data is generated with the Bayes network Toolbox (BNT) [15] using dynamic Bayesian network models. Two sets of data, denoted by D1 and D2, are simulated, each containing 15 and 35 processes, respectively. For simplicity, all processes are {0, 1} valued. The processes are created with both simultaneous and historical dependence on each other. The order (memory length) of the historical dependence is set to 3. The MCMC sampling engine is used to draw n = 104 points for both D1 and D2. The stock market dataset, denoted by ST, contains hourly values of 41 stocks and indexes for the years 2014-2015. Note that data imputation is performed to amend a few missing values, and all processes are aligned in time. Moreover, we detrend each time\nseries with a recursive HP-filter [24] to remove long-term daily or monthly seasonalities that are not relevant for hourly analysis.\nDirected information is estimated with the procedure proposed in [9], which adopts the context tree weighting algorithm as an intermediate step to learn universal probability assignment. Interested readers are referred to [19][20] for other possible estimators. The maximal context tree depth is set to 5, which is sufficient for both the synthesis datasets and the real-world ST dataset.\nCausal Subset Selection Results\nFirstly, the causal sensor placement problem, OPT1, is solved on data set D1 with the random greedy algorithm. Figure 1 shows the optimal solution by exhaustive search (red-star), random greedy solution (blue-circle), the 1/e reference bound (cyan-triangle), and the bound with SmI (magentadiamond), each for cardinality constraints imposed from k = 2 to k = 8. It is seen that the random greedy solution is close to the true optimum. In terms of computational time, the greedy method finishes in less than five minutes, while the exhaustive search takes about 10 hours on this small-scale problem (|V | = 15). Comparing two bounds in Figure 1, we see that the theoretical guarantee is greatly improved, and a much tighter bound is produced with SmI. The corresponding normalized SmI values, defined by SmIf(Lg) , is shown in the first row of Table 1. As a consequence of those strictly positive SmI values and Corollary 2, the guarantees are made greater than 1/e. This observation justifies that the bounds with SmI are better indicators of the performance of the greedy heuristic.\nSecondly, the causal covariates selection problem, OPT2, is solved on ST dataset with the stock XOM used as the target process Y . The results of random greedy, exhaustive search, and performance bound (Corollary 1) are shown in Figure 2, and normalized SmIs are listed in the second row of Table 1. Note that the 1 − 1/e reference line (green-triangle) in the figure is only for comparison purpose and is NOT an established bound. We observe that although the objective is not submodular, the random greedy algorithm is still near optimal. As we compare the reference line and the bound calculated with SmI (magenta-diamond), we see that the performance guarantee can be either larger or smaller than 1−1/e, depending on the sign of SmI. By definition, SmI measures the submodularity of a function at a location set. Hence, the SmI computed at each greedy selection captures the “local” submodularity of the function. The central insight gained from this experiment is that, for a function lacking general submodularity, such as the objective function of OPT2, it can be quasi-submodular (SmI ≤ 0, SmI ≈ 0) or super-submodular (SmI > 0) at different locations. Accordingly the performance guarantee can be either larger or smaller than 1− 1/e, depending on the values of SmI. Application: Causal Structure Learning The greedy method for subset selection can be used in many situations. Here we briefly illustrate the structure learning application based on covariates selection. As is detailed in the supplementary material and [20], one can show that the causal structure learning problem can be reduces to solving argmaxS⊆V,|S|≤k I(Sn → Xni ) for each node i ∈ V ,\nassuming maximal in degree is bounded by k for all nodes. Since the above problem is exactly the covariate selection considered in this work, we can reconstruct the causal structure for a network of random processes by simply using the greedy heuristic for each node.\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate the structure learning results on D1 and D2, respectively. In both two figures, the left subfigure is the ground truth structure, i.e., the dynamic Bayesian networks that are used in the data generation. Note that each node in the figure represents a random process, and an edge from node i to j indicates a causal (including both simultaneous and historical) influence. The subfigure on the right shows the reconstructed causal graph. Comparing two subfigures in Figure 3, we observe that the simple structure learning method performs almost flawlessly. In fact, only the edge 6 → 4 is miss detected. On the larger case D2 with 35 processes, the method still works relatively well, correctly reconstructing 82.69% causal relations. Given that only the maximal in degree for all nodes is assumed a priori, these results not only justify the greedy approximation for the subset selection, but also demonstrate its effectiveness in causal structure learning applications."

Two typical tasks, causal sensor placement and covariate selection, are correspondingly formulated into cardinality constrained directed information maximizations. To attack the NP-hard problems, we show that the first problem is submodular while not necessarily monotonic. And the second one is “nearly” submodular. To substantiate the idea of approximate submodularity, we introduce a novel quantity, namely submodularity index (SmI), for general set functions. Moreover, we show that based on SmI, greedy algorithm has performance guarantee for the maximization of possibly non-monotonic and non-submodular functions, justifying its usage for a much broader class of problems. We evaluate the theoretical results with several case studies, and also illustrate the application of the subset selection to causal structure learning.",
