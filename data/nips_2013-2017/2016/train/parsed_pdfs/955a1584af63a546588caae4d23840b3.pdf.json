      "text" : "The primary objective of linear regression is to determine the relationships between multiple variables and how they may affect a certain outcome. A standard example is that of medical diagnosis, whereby the data gathered for a given patient provides information about their susceptibility to certain illnesses. A major drawback to this process is the work necessary to collect the data, as it requires running numerous tests for each person, some of which may be discomforting. In such cases it may be necessary to impose limitations on the amount of data available for each example. For medical diagnosis, this might mean having each patient only undergo a small subset of tests.\nA formal setting for capturing regression and learning with limits on the number of attribute observations is known as the Limited Attribute Observation (LAO) setting, first introduced by Ben-David and Dichterman [1]. For example, in a regression problem, the learner has access to a distribution D over data (x, y) 2 Rd ⇥ R, and fits the best (generalized) linear model according to a certain loss function, i.e., it approximately solves the optimization problem\nmin w:kwkp B\nLD (w), LD (w) = E(x,y)⇠D f `(w>x y) g .\nIn the LAO setting, the learner does not have complete access to the examples x, which the reader may think of as attributes of a certain patient. Rather, the learner can observe at most a fixed number of these attributes, denoted k  d. If k = d, this is the standard regression problem which can be solved to arbitrary precision.\nThe main question we address: is it possible to compute an arbitrarily accurate solution if the number of observations per example, k, is strictly less than d? More formally, given any \" > 0, can one compute a vector w for which\nLD (w)  minkw⇤ kp B LD (w⇤) + \".\nEfficient algorithms for regression with squared loss when k < d have been shown in previous work [2], and the sample complexity bounds have since been tightened [6, 8]. However, similar results for\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nother common loss functions such as e.g. absolute loss have only been shown by relaxing the hard limit of k attributes per example [3, 6].\nIn this paper we show, for the first time, that in fact this problem cannot be solved in general. Our main result shows that even for regression with the absolute loss function, for any k  d 1, there is an information-theoretic lower bound on the error attainable by any algorithm. That is, there is some \"0 > 0 for which an \"0-optimal solution cannot be determined, irrespective of the number of examples the learner sees. Formally, with constant probability, any algorithm returning a vector w 2 Rd must satisfy\nLD (w) > minkw⇤ kp B LD (w⇤) + \"0.\nWe further show that this ultimate achievable precision parameter is bounded from below by a polynomial in the dimension, i.e., \"0 = ⌦(d 3/2).\nAdditionally, for the basic setting of Ridge regression (with the squared loss), we give a tight lower bound for the LAO setting. Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2] provided the first efficient algorithm for this setting with sample complexity of O(d2/k\"2) for \" error. Hazan and Koren [6] improved upon this result and gave a tight sample complexity of O(d/k\"2) to achieve \" error. In both cases, however, the algorithms only work when k 2. We complete the picture and show that k 2 attributes are in fact necessary to obtain arbitrarily low error. That is, with only one attribute per example, there is an information-theoretic limit on the accuracy attainable by any regression algorithm. We remark that a similar impossibility result was proven by Cesa-Bianchi et al. [3] in the related setting of learning with noisy examples.\nClassification may be similarly cast in the LAO setting. For classification with the hinge loss, namely soft-margin SVM, we give a related lower bound, showing that it is impossible to achieve arbitrarily low error if the number of observed attributes is bounded by k  d 1. However, unlike our lower bound for regression, the lower bound we prove for classification scales exponentially with the dimension. Although Hazan et al. [7] showed how classification may be done with missing data, their work includes low rank assumptions and so it is not in contradiction with the lower bounds presented here.\nSimilar to the LAO setting, the setting of learning with missing data [9, 4, 10, 11] presents the learner with examples where the attributes are randomly observed. Since the missing data setting is at least as difficult as the LAO setting, our lower bounds extend to this case as well.\nWe complement these lower bounds with a general purpose algorithm for regression and classification with missing data that, given a sufficient number of samples, can achieve an error of O(1/ p d). This result leaves only a small polynomial gap compared to the information-theoretic lower bound that we prove."

      "text" : "The general framework of linear regression involves a set of instances, each of the form (x, y) where x 2 Rd is the attribute vector and y 2 R is the corresponding target value. Under the typical statistical learning framework [5], each (x, y) pair is drawn from a joint distribution D over Rd ⇥ R. The learner’s objective is to determine some linear predictor w such that w>x does well in predicting y. The quality of prediction is measured according to a loss function ` : R 7! R. Two commonly used loss functions for regression are the squared loss `(w>x y) = 12 (w>x y)2 and the absolute loss `(w>x y) = |w>x y |. Since our examples are drawn from some arbitrary distribution D, it is best to consider the expected loss\nLD (w) = E(x,y)⇠D ⇥ `(w>x y)⇤ .\nThe learner’s goal then is to determine a regressor w that minimizes the expected loss LD (w). To avoid overfitting, a regularization term is typically added, which up to some constant factor is equivalent to\nmin w2Rd LD (w) s.t. kwkp  B\nfor some regularization parameter B > 0, where k · kp is the standard `p norm, p 1. Two common variants of regression are Ridge regression (p = 2 with squared loss) and Lasso regression (p = 1 with squared loss).\nThe framework for classification is nearly identical to that of linear regression. The main distinction comes from a different meaning of y 2 R, namely that y acts as a label for the corresponding example. The loss function also changes when learning a classifier, and in this paper we are interested in the hinge loss `(y · w>x) = max{0, 1 y · w>x}. The overall goal of the learner, however, remains the same: namely, to determine a classifier w such that LD (w) is minimized. Throughout the paper, we let w⇤ denote the minimizer of LD (w)."

Also, notice the order of quantification in the theorems: it turns out that there exists a distribution which is hard for all algorithms (rather than a different hard distribution for any algorithm).\nFor regression with absolute loss, we consider the setting where the learner is limited to seeing k or fewer attributes of each training sample. Theorem 3 below shows that in the case where k < d the learner cannot hope to learn an \"-optimal regressor for some \" > 0.\nTheorem 3.

      "text" : "Proof of Theorem 1. It is enough to prove the theorem for deterministic learning algorithms, namely, for algorithms that do not use any external randomization (i.e., any randomization besides the random samples drawn from the data distribution itself). This is because any randomized algorithm can\nbe thought of as a distribution over deterministic algorithms, which is independent of the data distribution.\nNow, suppose 0 < \" < 132 . Let X1 = {(0, 0), (1, 1)}, X2 = {(0, 1), (1, 0)}, and let D1 and D2 be uniform distributions over X1 ⇥ {1} and X2 ⇥ {1}, respectively. The main observation is that any learner that can observe at most one attribute of each example cannot distinguish between the two distributions with probability greater than 12 , no matter how many samples it is given. This is because the marginal distributions of the individual attributes under both D1 and D2 are exactly the same. Thus, to prove the theorem it is enough to show that the sets of \"-optimal solutions under the distributions D1 and D2 are disjoint. Indeed, suppose that there is a learning algorithm that emits a vector ŵ such that E[LD (ŵ) LD (w⇤)] < \"/2 (where the expectation is over the random samples from D used by the algorithm). By Markov’s inequality, it holds that LD (ŵ) < LD (w⇤) + \" with probability > 1/2. Hence, the output of the algorithm allows one to distinguish between the two distributions with probability > 1/2, contradicting the indistinguishability property.\nWe set to characterize the sets of \"-optimal solutions under D1 and D2. For D1, we have\nLD1 (w) = 1 2\nX\nx2X1\n1 2 (w>x 1)2 = 1 4 + 1 4 (w1 + w2 1)2,\nwhile for D2, LD2 (w) =\n1 2\nX\nx2X2\n1 2 (w>x 1)2 = 1 4 (w1 1)2 + 1 4 (w2 1)2.\nNote that the set of \"-optimal regressors for LD1 is S1 = {w : |w>1 1|  2 p \"}, whereas for LD2\nthe set is S2 = {w : kw 1k2  2 p \"}. Let S02 = {w : |w>1 2|  2 p 2\"}. Then S2 ✓ S02, so it is sufficient to show that S1 and S02 are disjoint.\nSince \" < 132 , for any w 2 S1, |w>1 1| < 12 , meaning w>1 < 32 . However, for any w 2 S02, |w>1 2| < 12 meaning w>1 > 32 , and so w cannot be a member of both S1 and S2. As we argued earlier, this suffices to prove the theorem. ⇤"

      "text" : "As in the proof of Theorem 1, the main idea is to show that one can design two distributions that are indistinguishable to a learner who can observe no more than d 1 attributes of any sample given by the distribution (i.e., that their marginals over any choice of d 1 attributes are identical), but whose respective sets of \"-optimal regressors are disjoint. However, in contrast to Theorem 1, both handling general d along with switching to the absolute loss introduce additional complexities to the proof that require different techniques.\nWe start by constructing these two distributions D1 and D2. Let X1 = {x = (x1, . . . , xd ) : x 2 {0, 1}d, kxk1 ⌘ 0 (mod 2)} and X2 = {x = (x1, . . . , xd ) : x 2 {0, 1}d, kxk1 ⌘ 1 (mod 2)}, and let D1 and D2 be uniform over X1 ⇥ {1} and X2 ⇥ {1}, respectively. From this construction, it is not hard to see that for any choice of k  d 1 attributes, the marginals over the k attributes of both distributions are identical: they are both a uniform distribution over k bits. Thus, the distributions D1 and D2 are indistinguishable to a learner that can only observe at most d 1 attributes of each example. Let `(w>x y) = |w>x y |, and let\nLD1 (w) = E(x,y)⇠D1 [`(w>x, y)] = 1 2d 1 X\nx2X1 |w>x 1|,\nand LD2 (w) = E(x,y)⇠D2 [`(w>x, y)] =\n1 2d 1\nX x2X2 |w>x 1|.\nIt turns out that the subgradients of LD1 (w) and LD2 (w), which we denote by @LD1 (w) and @LD2 (w) respectively, can be expressed precisely. In fact, the full subgradient set at every point in the domain for both functions can be made explicit. With these representations in hand, we can show that w⇤1 = 2 d 1d and w ⇤ 2 = 2 d+2 1d are minimizers of LD1 (w) and LD2 (w), respectively.\nIn fact, using the subgradient sets we can prove a much stronger property of the expected losses LD1 and LD2 , akin to a “directional strong convexity” property around their respective minimizers. The geometric idea behind this property is shown in Figure 1, whereby LD is lower bounded by an absolute value function. Lemma 6. Let w⇤1 = 2 d 1d . For any w 2 Rd we have\nLD1 (w) LD1 (w⇤1) p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1) .\nLemma 7. Let w⇤2 = 2 d+2 1d . For any w 2 Rd we have\nLD2 (w) LD2 (w⇤2) p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤2) .\nGiven Lemmas 6 and 7, the proof of Theorem 3 is immediate.\nProof of Theorem 3. As a direct consequence of Lemmas 6 and 7, we obtain that the sets\nS1 = 8><>:w : p 2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1)  \" 9>=>;\nand\nS2 = 8><>:w : p 2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤2)  \" 9>=>;\ncontain the sets of \"-optimal regressors for LD1 (w) and LD2 (w), respectively. All that is needed now is to show a separation of their \"-optimal sets for 0 < \" < 160 d\n32 , and this is done by showing a separation of the more manageable sets S1 and S2. Indeed, fix 0 < \" < 160 d\n32 and observe that for any w 2 S1 we have p 2⇡\ne4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1)  160 d 3 2 and so, for d 4,\n1>dw 2 1 2d > 2 1 d + 2 = 2d + 3 d + 2 .\nOn the other hand, for any w 2 S2 we have p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤2)  160 d 3 2 , thus\n1>dw  2d\nd + 2 + 1 2d < 2d d + 2 + 1 d + 2 = 2d + 1 d + 2 .\nWe see that no w can exist in both S1 and S2, so these sets are disjoint. Theorem 3 follows by the same reasoning used to conclude the proof of Theorem 1. ⇤\nIt remains to prove Lemmas 6 and 7. As the proofs are very similar, we will only prove Lemma 6 here and defer the proof of Lemma 7 to the supplementary material.\nProof of Lemma 6. We first write\n@LD1 (w) = 1 2d 1 X x2X1 @`(w>x, 1) = 1 2d 1 X x2X1 sign(w>x 1) · x.\nLetting w⇤1 = 2 d · 1d , we have that\n@LD1 (w⇤1) = 1 2d 1 X\nx2X1 sign(w⇤>1 x 1) · x\n= 1\n2d 1\n✓ X\nx2X1, kxk1= d2\nsign(w⇤>1 x 1) · x\n+ X\nx2X1, kxk1> d2\nsign(w⇤>1 x 1) · x + X\nx2X1, kxk1< d2\nsign(w⇤>1 x 1) · x ◆\n= 1\n2d 1\n✓ X\nx2X1, kxk1= d2\nsign(0) · x + X\nx2X1, kxk1> d2\nx X\nx2X1, kxk1< d2\nx ◆ ,\nwhere sign(0) can be any number in [ 1, 1]. Next, we compute\nX\nx2X1, kxk1> d2\nx X\nx2X1, kxk1< d2\nx = d 2X\ni= d4 +1\nd 1 2i 1\n! · 1d d 4 1X\ni=1\nd 1 2i 1\n! · 1d\n=\nd 2 2X\ni=0\n( 1)i d 1\ni\n! · 1d\n= d 2 d 2 2\n! · 1d ,\nwhere the last equality follows from the elementary identity Pk i=0( 1)i ⇣ n i ⌘ = ( 1)k ⇣ n 1 k ⌘ , which we prove in Lemma 9 in the supplementary material. Now, let X⇤ = {x 2 X1 : kxk1 = d2 }, let m = |X⇤ |, and let X = [x1, . . . , xm] 2 Rd⇥m be the matrix formed by all x 2 X⇤. Then we may express the entire subgradient set explicitly as\n@LD1 (w⇤1) = ⇢ 1\n2d 1\n✓ Xr +\nd 2 d 2 2\n! · 1d ◆ r 2 [ 1, 1]m .\nThus, any choice of r 2 [ 1, 1]m will result in a specific subgradient of LD1 (w⇤1). Consider two such choices: r1 = 0 and r2 = 1d . Note that Xr1 = 0 and Xr2 =\n⇣ d 1 d 2 1 ⌘ · 1d ; to see the last equality,\nconsider any fixed coordinate i and notice that the number of elements in X⇤ with non-zero values in the i’th coordinate is equal to the number of ways to choose the remaining d2 1 non-zero coordinates from the other d 1 coordinates. We then observe that the corresponding subgradients are\nh+ = 1 2d 1 Xr1 + d 2 d 2 2\n! · 1d ! =\n1 2d 1 d 2 d 2 2\n! · 1d,\nand h = 1\n2d 1\nXr2 + d 2 d 2 2\n! · 1d ! = 1\n2d 1 d 2 d 2 1\n! · 1d .\nNote that, since the set of subgradients of LD1 (w⇤1) is a convex set, by taking a convex combination of h+ and h it follows that 0 2 @LD1 (w⇤1) and so we see that w⇤1 is a minimizer of LD1 (w).\nGiven a handle on the subgradient set, we now show that these coefficients are polynomial in d. Observe that, using the fact that p 2⇡n( ne ) n  n!  epn( ne )n, we have\n1 2d 1 d 2 d 2 2\n! 1 2d 1 *... ,\np 2⇡(d 2) ⇣ d 2 e ⌘d 2\ne2 q\nd 4 2 q d 2 ⇣ d 4 2e ⌘ d 2 2 ⇣ d 2e ⌘ d 2 +/// -\n1 2d 1 *. ,\np 2⇡\ne2 p d ⇣\n1 2d 1 ⌘ +/ - d 2 d\n!d 2\n*, p 2⇡ e2 p d + - 1 2 d 2 !d 2\np\n2⇡ e4 p d .\nLet h⇤ = p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1d . Since h⇤ can be written as a convex combination of h+ and 0, we see that\nh⇤ 2 @LD1 (w⇤1). Similarly we may see that\n1 2d 1 d 2 d 2 1\n!  1 2d 1 *.. ,\np 2⇡(d 2) ⇣ d 2 e ⌘d 2\ne2( d2 1) ⇣ d 2 2e ⌘d 2 +// - =\np 2⇡\ne2 p d 2  p 2⇡ e4 p d .\nAgain, since h⇤ can be written as a convex combination of the vectors h and 0 in the subgradient set, we may conclude that h⇤ 2 @LD1 (w⇤1) as well. By the subgradient inequality it follows that, for all w 2 Rd ,\nLD1 (w) LD1 (w⇤1) h⇤>(w w⇤1) = p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1)\nand\nLD1 (w) LD1 (w⇤1) h⇤>(w w⇤1) = p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1),\nwhich taken together imply that\nLD1 (w) LD1 (w⇤1) p\n2⇡ e4 p d · 1>d (w w⇤1)\nas required. ⇤"
