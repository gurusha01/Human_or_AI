      "text" : "This paper studies sparse linear regression problems of the form y = Φx0 + w, where x0 ∈ Rn is the unknown vector to estimate, supposed to be non-zero and sparse, w ∈ Rm is some additive noise and the design matrix Φm×n is in general rank deficient corresponding to a noisy underdetermined linear system of equations, i.e., typically in the high-dimensional regime where m n. This can also be understood as an inverse problem in imaging sciences, a particular instance of which being the compressed sensing problem [3], where the matrix Φ is drawn from some appropriate random matrix ensemble.\nIn order to recover a sparse vector x0, a popular regularization is the `1-norm, in which case we consider the following constrained sparsity-promoting optimization problem\nmin x∈Rn {||x||1 s.t. ||Φx− y||α 6 τ} , (Pτα(y)) 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nwhere for α ∈ [1,+∞], ||u||α def.= ( ∑ i |ui|α)\n1/α denotes the `α-norm, and the constraint size τ > 0 should be adapted to the noise level. To avoid trivialities, through the paper, we assume that problem (Pτα(y)) is feasible, which is of course the case if τ > ||w||α. In the special situation where there is no noise, i.e., w = 0, it makes sense to consider τ = 0 and solve the so-called Lasso [14] or Basis-Pursuit problem [4], which is independent of α, and reads\nmin x {||x||1 s.t. Φx = Φx0} . (P0(Φx0))\nThe case α = 2 corresponds to the usual `2 loss function, which entails a smooth constraint set, and has been studied in depth in the literature (see Section 1.6 for an overview). In contrast, the cases α ∈ {1,+∞} correspond to very different setups, where the loss function || · ||α is polyhedral and non-smooth. They are expected to lead to significantly different estimation results and require to develop novel theoretical results, which is the focus of this paper. The case α = 1 corresponds to a “robust” loss function, and is important to cope with impulse noise or outliers contaminating the data (see for instance [11, 13, 9]). At the extreme opposite, the case α = +∞ is typically used to handle uniform noise such as in quantization (see for instance [10]). This paper studies the stability of the support supp(xτ ) of minimizers xτ of (Pτα(y)). In particular, we provide a sharp analysis for the polyhedral cases α ∈ {1,+∞} that allows one to control the deviation of supp(xτ ) from supp(x0) if ||w||α is not too large and τ is chosen proportionally to ||w||α. The general case is studied numerically in a compressed sensing experiment where we compare supp(xτ ) and supp(x0) for α ∈ [1,+∞]."

Assuming this is the case, our main theoretical finding (Theorem 1) states that the stability (and instability) of the support of x0 is characterized by the following specific subset of certificates\npβ ∈ Argmin p∈Dx0 ||p||β where 1α + 1β = 1. (2)\nWe call such a certificate pβ a minimum norm certificate. Note that for 1 < α < +∞, this pβ is actually unique but that for α ∈ {1,∞} it might not be the case. Associated to such a minimal norm certificate, we define the extended support as\nJ def. = sat(Φ∗pβ) = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} | |(Φ∗pβ)i| = 1} . (3)\nWhen the certificate pβ from which J is computed is unclear from the context, we write it explicitly as an index Jpβ . Note that, from the definition of Dx0 , one always has I ⊆ J .

      "text" : "In the case of noiseless observations (w = 0) and when τ > 0, the following general lemma whose proof can be found in Section 2 associate to a given dual certificate pβ an explicit solution of (Pτα(Φx0)). This formula depends on a so-called Lagrange multiplier vector vβ ∈ Rn, which will be instrumental to state our main contribution (Theorem 1). Note that this lemma is valid for any α ∈ [1,∞]. Even though this goes beyond the scope of our main result, one can use the same lemma for an arbitrary `α-norm for α ∈ [1,∞] (see Section 3) or for even more general loss functions. Lemma 1 (Noiseless solution). We assume that x0 is identifiable, i.e. it is a solution to (P0(Φx0)), and consider τ > 0. Then there exists a vβ ∈ Rn supported on J such that Φ·,Jvβ,J ∈ ∂||pβ ||β and − sign(vβ,J̃) = Φ∗·,J̃pβ where we denoted J̃ def.= J\\I . If τ is such that 0 < τ < x||vβ,I ||∞ , with x = mini∈I |x0,I |, then a solution x̄τ of (Pτα(Φx0)) with support equal to J is given by x̄τ,J = x0,J − τvβ,J . Moreover, its entries have the same sign as those of x0 on its support I , i.e., sign(x̄τ,I) = sign(x0,I).\nAn important question that arises is whether vβ can be computed explicitly. For this, let us define the model tangent subspace Tβ def. = par(∂||pβ ||β)⊥, i.e., Tβ is the orthogonal to the subspace parallel to ∂||pβ ||β , which uniquely defines the model vector, eβ def.= PTβ∂||pβ ||β , as shown on Figure 1 (see [17] for details). Using this notation, vβ,J is uniquely defined and expressed in closed-form as\nvβ,J = (PTβΦ·,J) +eβ (4)\nif and only if the following restricted injectivity condition holds Ker(PTβΦ·,J) = {0}. (INJα) For the special case (α, β) = (∞, 1), the following lemma, proved in Section 2, gives easily verifiable sufficient conditions, which ensure that (INJ∞) holds. The notation S def. = supp(p1) is used. Lemma 2 (Restricted injectivity for α =∞). Assume x0 is identifiable and ΦS,J has full rank. If sJ /∈ Im(Φ∗S′,J) ∀S′ ⊆ {1, . . . ,m}, |S′| < |J | and qS /∈ Im(ΦS,J ′) ∀J ′ ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, |J ′| < |S|,\nwhere sJ = Φ∗·,Jp1 ∈ {−1, 1}|J|, and qS = sign(p1,S) ∈ {−1, 1}|S|, then, |S| = |J | and ΦS,J is invertible, i.e., since PT1Φ·,J = Id·,SΦS,J , (INJ∞) holds. Remark 1. If Φ is randomly drawn from a continuous distribution with i.i.d. entries, e.g., Gaussian, then as soon as x0 is identifiable, the conditions of Lemma 2 hold with probability 1 over the distribution of Φ. For (α, β) = (1,∞), we define Z def.= sat(p∞),\nΘ def. =\n[ IdZc,·\nsign(p∗∞,Z)IdZ,·\n] and Φ̃ def.= ΘΦ·,J .\nFollowing similar reasoning as in Lemma 2 and Remark 1, we can reasonably assume that |Zc|+ 1 = |J | and Φ̃ is invertible.

      "text" : "Our main contribution is Theorem 1 below. A similar result is known to hold in the case of the smooth `2 loss (α = 2, see Section 1.6). Our paper extends it to the more challenging case of non-smooth losses α ∈ {1,+∞}. The proof for α = +∞ is detailed in Section 2. It is important to emphasize that the proof strategy is significantly different from the classical approach developed for α = 2, mainly because of the lack of smoothness of the loss function. The proof for α = 1 follows a similar structure, and due to space limitation, it can be found in the supplementary material. Theorem 1. Let α ∈ {1, 2,+∞}. Suppose that x0 is identifiable, and let pβ be a minimal norm certificate (see (2)) with associated extended support J (see (3)). Suppose that the restricted injectivity condition (INJα) is satisfied so that vβ,J can be explicitly computed (see (4)). Then there exist constants c1, c2 > 0 depending only on Φ and pβ such that, for any (w, τ) satisfying\n||w||α < c1τ and τ 6 c2x where x def.= min i∈I |x0,I |, (5)\na solution xτ of (Pτα(Φx0 + w)) with support equal to J is given by xτ,J def. = x0,J + (PTβΦ·,J) +w − τvβ,J . (6)\nThis theorem shows that if the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough and τ is chosen in proportion to the noise level ||w||α , then there is a solution supported exactly in the extended support J . Note in particular that this solution (6) has the correct sign pattern sign(xτ,I) = sign(x0,I), but might exhibit outliers if J̃ def.= J\\I 6= ∅. The special case I = J characterizes the exact support stability (“sparsistency”), and in the case α = 2, the assumptions involving the dual certificate correspond to a condition often referred to as “irrepresentable condition” in the literature (see Section 1.6).\nIn Section 3, we propose numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings on a compressed sensing (CS) scenario. Using Theorem 1, we are able to numerically assess the degree of support instability of CS recovery using `α fidelity. As a prelude to shed light on this result, we show on Figure 2, a smaller simulated CS example for (α, β) = (∞, 1). The parameters are n = 20, m = 10 and |I| = 4 and x0 and Φ are generated as in the experiment of Section 3 and we use CVX/MOSEK [8, 7] at best precision to solve the optimization programs. First, we observe that x0 is indeed identifiable by solving (P0(Φx0)). Then we solve (2) to compute pβ and predict the extended support J . Finally, we add uniformly distributed noise w with wi ∼i.i.d. U(−δ, δ) and δ chosen appropriately to ensure that the hypotheses hold and we solve (Pτα(y)). Observe that as we increase τ , new non-zero entries appear in xτ but because w and τ are small enough, as predicted, we have supp(xτ ) = J .\nLet us now comment on the limitations of our analysis. First, this result does not trivially extend to the general case α ∈ [1,+∞] as there is, in general, no simple closed form for xτ . A generalization would require more material and is out of the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, our simulations in Section 3 stand for arbitrary α ∈ [1,+∞] which is why the general formulation was presented. Second, larger noise regime, though interesting, is also out of the scope. Let us note that no other results in the literature (even for `2) provide any insight about sparsistency in the large noise regime. In that case, we are only able to provide bounds on the distance between x0 and the recovered vector but this is the subject of a forthcoming paper.\nFinally our work is agnostic with respect to the noise models. Being able to distinguish between different noise models would require further analysis of the constant involved and some additional constraint on Φ. However, our result is a big step towards the understanding of the solutions behavior and can be used in this analysis."

      "text" : "To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 1 is the first to study the support stability guarantees by minimizing the `1-norm with non-smooth loss function, and in particular here the `1 and `∞ losses. The smooth case α = 2 is however much more studied, and in particular, the associated support stability results we state here are now well understood. Note that most of the corresponding literature studies in general the penalized form, i.e., minx 12 ||Φx − y||2 + λ||x||1 instead of our constrained formulation (Pτα(y)). In the case α = 2, since the loss is smooth, this distinction is minor and the proof is almost the same for both settings. However, for α ∈ {1,+∞}, it is crucial to study the constrained problems to be able to state our results. The support stability (also called “sparsistency”, corresponding to the special case I = J of our result) of (Pτα(y)) in the case α = 2 has been proved by several authors in slightly different setups. In the signal processing literature, this result can be traced back to the early work of J-J. Fuchs [6] who showed Theorem 1 when α = 2 and I = J . In the statistics literature, sparsistency is also proved in [19] in the case where Φ is random, the result of support stability being then claimed with high probability. The condition that I = J , i.e., that the minimal norm certificate pβ (for α = β = 2) is saturating only on the support, is often coined the “irrepresentable condition” in the statistics and machine learning literature. These results have been extended recently in [5] to the case where the support I is not stable, i.e. I ( J . One could also cite [15], whose results are somewhat connected but are restricted to the `2 loss and do not hold in our case. Note that “sparsistency”-like results have been proved for many “low-complexity” regularizers beyond the `1-norm. Let us quote among others: the group-lasso [1], the nuclear norm [2], the total variation [16] and a very general class of “partly-smooth” regularizers [17]. Let us also point out that one of the main sources of application of these results is the analysis of the performance of compressed sensing problems, where the randomness of Φ allows to derive sharp sample complexity bounds as a function of the sparsity of x0 and n, see for instance [18]. Let us also stress that these support recovery results are different from those obtained using tools such as the Restricted Isometry Property and alike (see for instance [3]) in many respects. For instance, the guarantees they provide are uniform (i.e., they hold for any sparse enough vector x0), though they usually lead to quite pessimistic worst-case bounds, and the stability is measured in `2 sense."

      "text" : "In this section, we prove the main result of this paper. For the sake of brevity, when part of the proof will become specific to a particular choice of α, we will only write the details for α =∞. The details of the proof for α = 1 can be found in the supplementary material.\nIt can be shown that the Fenchel-Rockafellar dual problem to (Pτα(y)) is [12] min p∈Rm\n{−〈y, p〉+ τ ||p||β s.t. ||Φ∗p||∞ 6 1} . (Dτβ(y)) From the corresponding (primal-dual) extremality relations, one can deduce that (x̂, p̂) is an optimal primal-dual Kuhn-Tucker pair if, and only if,\nΦ∗·,Î p̂ = sign(x̂Î) and ||Φ ∗p̂||∞ 6 1. (7)\nwhere Î = supp(x̂), and y − Φx̂ τ\n∈ ∂||p̂||β . (8) The first relationship comes from the sub-differential of the `1 regularization term while the second is specific to a particular choice of α for the `α-norm data fidelity constraint. We start by proving the Lemma 1 and Lemma 2.\nProof of Lemma 1 Let us rewrite the problem (2) by introducing the auxiliary variable η = Φ∗p as\nmin p,η {||p||β + ιB∞(η) | η = Φ∗p, ηI = sign(x0,I)} , (9)\nwhere ιB∞ is the indicator function of the unit `∞ ball. Define the Lagrange multipliers v and zI and the associated Lagrangian function\nL(p, η, v, zI) = ||p||β + ιB∞(η) + 〈v, η − Φ∗p〉+ 〈zI , ηI − sign(x0,I)〉. Defining zIc = 0, the first order optimality conditions (generalized KKT conditions) for p and η read\nΦv ∈ ∂||p||β and − v − z ∈ ∂ιB∞(η),\nFrom the normal cone of the B∞ at η on its boundary, the second condition is\n−v − z ∈ {u | uJc = 0, sign(uJ) = ηJ } , where J = sat(η) = sat(Φ∗p). Since I ⊆ J , v is supported on J . Moreover, on J̃ = J\\I , we have − sign(vJ̃) = ηJ̃ . As pβ is a solution to (9), we can define a corresponding vector of Lagrange multipliers vβ supported on J such that − sign(vβ,J̃) = Φ∗·,J̃pβ and Φ·,Jvβ,J ∈ ∂||pβ ||β .\nTo prove the lemma, it remains to show that x̄τ is indeed a solution to (Pτα(y)), i.e., it obeys (7) and (8) for some dual variable p̂. We will show that this is the case with p̂ = pβ . Observe that pβ 6= 0 as otherwise, it would mean that x0 = 0, which contradicts our initial assumption of non-zero x0. We can then directly see that (8) is satisfied. Indeed, noting y0 def. = Φx0, we can write\ny0 − Φ·,J x̄τ,J = τΦ·,Jvβ,J ∈ τ∂||pβ ||β . By definition of pβ , we have ||Φ∗pβ ||∞ 6 1. In addition, it must satisfy Φ∗·,Jpβ = sign(x̄τ,J).Outside I , the condition is always satisfied since − sign(vβ,J̃) = Φ∗·,J̃pβ . On I , we know that Φ ∗ ·,Ipβ = sign(x0,I). The condition on τ is thus |x0,i| > τ |vβ,i| ,∀i ∈ I , or equivalently, τ < x||vβ,I ||∞ .\nProof of Lemma 2 As established by Lemma 1, the existence of p1 and of v1 are implied by the identifiability of x0. We have the following,\n∃p1 ⇒ ∃pS ,Φ∗S,JpS = sJ ⇔ Φ∗S,J is surjective⇔ |S| > |J | ∃v1 ⇒ ∃vJ ,ΦS,JvJ = qS ⇔ ΦS,J is surjective⇔ |J | > |S|,\nTo clarify, we detail the first line. Since Φ∗S,J is full rank, |S| > |J | is equivalent to surjectivity. Assume Φ∗S,J is not surjective so that |S| < |J |, then sJ /∈ Im(Φ∗S,J) and the over-determined system Φ∗S,JpS = sJ has no solution in pS , which contradicts the existence of p1. Now assume Φ ∗ S,J is surjective, then we can take pS = Φ ∗,† S,JsJ as a solution where Φ ∗,† S,J is any right-inverse of Φ ∗ S,J . This proves that ΦS,J is invertible.\nWe are now ready to prove the main result in the particular case α =∞.\nProof of Theorem 1 (α =∞) Our proof consists in constructing a vector supported on J , obeying the implicit relationship (6) and which is indeed a solution to (Pτ∞(Φx0 + w)) for an appropriate regime of the parameters (τ, ||w||α). Note that we assume that the hypothesis of Lemma 2 on Φ holds and in particular, ΦS,J is invertible. When (α, β) = (∞, 1), the first order condition (8), which holds for any optimal primal-dual pair (x, p), reads, with Sp def. = supp(p), ySp − ΦSp,·x = τ sign(pSp) and ||y − Φx||∞ 6 τ. (10) One should then look for a candidate primal-dual pair (x̂, p̂) such that supp(x̂) = J and satisfying\nySp̂ − ΦSp̂,J x̂J = τ sign(p̂Sp̂). (11) We now need to show that the first order conditions (7) and (10) hold for some p = p̂ solution of the “perturbed” dual problem (Dτ1 (Φx0 + w)) with x = x̂. Actually, we will show that under the conditions of the theorem, this holds for p̂ = p1, i.e., p1 is solution of (Dτ1 (Φx0 + w)) so that\nx̂J = Φ −1 S,JyS − τΦ−1S,J sign(p1,S) = x0,J + Φ−1S,JwS − τv1,J .\nLet us start by proving the equality part of (7), Φ∗S,J p̂S = sign(x̂J). Since ΦS,J is invertible, we have p̂S = p1,S if and only if sign(x̂J) = Φ∗S,Jp1,S . Noting IdI,J the restriction from J to I , we have\nsign ( x0,I + IdI,JΦ −1 S,JwS − τv1,I ) = sign (x0,I)\nas soon as ∣∣∣(Φ−1S,JwS) i − τv1,i ∣∣∣ < |x0,I | ∀i ∈ I. It is sufficient to require\n||IdI,JΦ−1S,JwS − τv1,I ||∞ < x ||Φ−1S,J ||∞,∞||w||∞ + τ ||v1,I ||∞ < x,\nwith x = mini∈I |x0,I |. Injecting the fact that ||w||∞ < c1τ (the value of c1 will be derived later), we get the condition\nτ (bc1 + ν) 6 x, with b = ||Φ−1S,J ||∞,∞ and ν = ||v1||∞ 6 b. Rearranging the terms, we obtain\nτ 6 x bc1 + ν = c2x,\nwhich guarantees sign(x̂I) = sign(x0,I). Outside I , defining IdJ̃,J as the restriction from J to J̃ , we must have\nΦ∗ S,J̃ p1,S = sign ( IdJ̃,JΦ −1 S,JwS − τv1,J̃ ) .\nFrom Lemma 1, we know that − sign(v1,J̃) = Φ∗S,J̃p1,S , so that the condition is satisfied as soon as∣∣∣∣(Φ−1S,JwS) j ∣∣∣∣ < τ |v1,j | ∀j ∈ J̃ . Noting v = minj∈J̃ |v1,j |, we get the sufficient condition for (7),\n||Φ−1S,JwS ||∞ < τv, ||w||∞ < τ v\nb . (c1a)\nWe can now verify (10). From (11) we see that the equality part is satisfied on S. Outside S, we have\nySc − ΦSc,·x̂ = wSc − ΦSc,JΦ−1S,JwS + τΦSc,Jv1,J , which must be smaller than τ , i.e., ||wSc − ΦSc,JΦ−1S,JwS + τΦSc,Jv1,J ||∞ 6 τ. It is thus sufficient to have\n(1 + ||ΦSc,JΦ−1S,J ||∞,∞)||w||∞ + τµ 6 τ,\nwith µ def.= ||ΦSc,Jv1,J ||∞. Noting a = ||ΦSc,JΦ−1S,J ||∞,∞, we get\n||w||∞ 6 1− µ 1 + a τ. (c1b)\n(c1a) and (c1b) together give the value of c1. This ensures that the inequality part of (10) is satisfied for x̂ and with that, that x̂ is solution to (Pτ∞(Φx0 + w)) and p1 solution to (Dτ1 (Φx0 + w)), which concludes the proof. Remark 2. From Lemma 1, we know that in all generality µ 6 1. If the inequality was saturated, it would mean that c1 = 0 and no noise would be allowed. Fortunately, it is easy to prove that under a mild assumption on Φ, similar to the one of Lemma 2 (which holds with probability 1 for Gaussian matrices), the inequality is strict, i.e., µ < 1."

      "text" : "In order to illustrate support stability in Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, we address numerically the problem of comparing supp(xτ ) and supp(x0) in a compressed sensing setting. Theorem 1 shows that supp(xτ ) does not depend on w (as long as it is small enough); simulations thus do not involve noise. All computations are done in Matlab, using CVX [8, 7], with the MOSEK solver at “best” precision setting to solve the convex problems. We set n = 1000, m = 900 and generate 200 times a random sensing matrix Φ ∈ Rm×n with Φij ∼i.i.d N (0, 1). For each sensing matrix, we generate 60 different k-sparse vectors x0 with support I where k def. = |I| varies from 10 to 600. The non-zero entries of x0 are randomly picked in {±1} with equal probability. Note that this choice does not impact the result because the definition of Jpβ only depends on sign(x0) (see (1)). It will only affect the bounds in (5). For each case, we verify that x0 is identifiable and for α ∈ {1, 2,∞} (which correspond to β ∈ {∞, 2, 1}), we compute the minimum `β-norm certificate pβ , solution to (2) and in particular, the support excess J̃pβ def. = sat(Φ∗pβ)\\I . It is important to emphasize that there is no noise in these simulations. As long as the hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied, we can predict that supp(xτ ) = Jpβ ⊂ I without actually computing xτ , or choosing τ , or generating w.\nWe define a support excess threshold se ∈ N varying from 0 to∞. On Figure 3 we plot the probability that x0 is identifiable and |J̃pβ |, the cardinality of the predicted support excess, is smaller or equal to se. It is interesting to note that the probability that |J̃p1 | = 0 (the bluest horizontal curve on the right plot) is 0, which means that even for extreme sparsity (k = 10) and a relatively high m/n rate of 0.9, the support is never predicted as perfectly stable for α =∞ in this experiment. We can observe as a rule of thumb, that a support excess of |J̃p1 | ≈ k is much more likely. In comparison, `2 recovery provides a much more likely perfect support stability for k not too large and the expected size of J̃p2 increases slower with k. Finally, we can comment that the support stability with `1 data fidelity is in between. It is possible to recover the support perfectly but the requirement on k is a bit more restrictive than with `2 fidelity.\nAs previously noted, Lemma 1 and its proof remain valid for smooth loss functions such as the `α-norm when α ∈ (1,∞). Therefore, it makes sense to compare the results with the ones obtained for α ∈ (1,∞) . On Figure 4 we display the result of the same experiment but with 1/α as the vertical axis. To realize the figure, we compute pβ and J̃pβ for β corresponding to 41 equispaced values of 1/α ∈ [0, 1]. The probability that |J̃pβ | 6 se is represented by the color intensity. The three different plots correspond to three different values for se. On this figure, the yellow to blue transition can be interpreted as the maximal k to ensure, with high probability, that |J̃pβ | does not exceeds se. It is always (for all se) further to the right at α = 2. It means that the `2 data fidelity constraint provides the highest support stability. Interestingly, we can observe that this maximal k decreases gracefully as α moves away from 2 in one way or the other. Finally, as already observed on Figure 3, we see that, especially when se is small, the `1 loss function has a small advantage over the `∞ loss."

More precisely, we focus in detail on the cases of `1 and `∞ losses, and contrast them with the usual `2 loss. While these losses are routinely used to account for either sparse (`1 loss) or uniform (`∞ loss) noise models, a theoretical analysis of their performance is still lacking. In this article, we extend the existing theory from the smooth `2 case to these non-smooth cases. We derive a sharp condition which ensures that the support of the vector to recover is stable to small additive noise in the observations, as long as the loss constraint size is tuned proportionally to the noise level. A distinctive feature of our theory is that it also explains what happens when the support is unstable. While the support is not stable anymore, we identify an “extended support” and show that this extended support is stable to small additive noise. To exemplify the usefulness of our theory, we give a detailed numerical analysis of the support stability/instability of compressed sensing recovery with these different losses. This highlights different parameter regimes, ranging from total support stability to progressively increasing support instability.",
