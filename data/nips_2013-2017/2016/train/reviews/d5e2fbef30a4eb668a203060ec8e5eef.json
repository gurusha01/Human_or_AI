{"title": "Efficient High-Order Interaction-Aware Feature Selection Based on Conditional Mutual Information", "abstract": "This study introduces a novel feature selection approach CMICOT, which is a further evolution of filter methods with sequential  forward selection (SFS) whose scoring functions are based on conditional mutual information (MI). We state and study a novel saddle point (max-min) optimization problem to build a scoring function that is able to identify joint interactions between several  features. This method fills the gap of MI-based SFS techniques with high-order dependencies. In this high-dimensional case, the estimation of MI has prohibitively high sample complexity. We mitigate this cost using a greedy approximation and binary representatives what makes our technique able to be effectively used. The superiority of our approach is demonstrated by comparison with recently proposed interaction-aware filters and several interaction-agnostic state-of-the-art ones on ten publicly available benchmark datasets.", "id": "d5e2fbef30a4eb668a203060ec8e5eef", "authors": ["Alexander Shishkin", "Anastasia Bezzubtseva", "Alexey Drutsa", "Ilia Shishkov", "Ekaterina Gladkikh", "Gleb Gusev", "Pavel Serdyukov"], "conference": "NIPS2016", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "This paper presents a new feature selection algorithm, named CMICOT, that considers high-order dependences among features (up to order t, with t > 3), and uses Mutual Information (MI) to measure such dependences. Additionally, in order to alleviate the lack of data and the increase on computational cost to properly estimate the mutual information, the CMICOT algorithm is a greedy approach that uses binary representatives of each feature. The proposed algorithm is tested against some state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms, and interaction-aware SFS-based filters. The presented results on 10 public datasets show that overall the CMICOT algorithm outperforms the other feature selection algorithm in terms of classification accuracy when kNN or AdaBoost are used as classifiers. The problem of designing a feature selection algorithm capable of efficiently deal with high-order interaction among features is an interesting and open problem in the feature selection area. That is why this paper is appealing. However, there are several issues regarding the computational cost and the experimental setup that need a clarification in order to consider it for acceptance. \u2022 My main concern is about the justification and analysis of the Binary representatives procedure described in Section 3.3, which I think compromises the acceptance of this paper. \u2022 On the one and, the theoretical justification of this procedure is not very convincing. It is said (lines 219-222) that \u201cThe described technique has been inspired by the intuition that probably two binary representatives of two different features interact on average better than two binary representatives of one feature\u201d; however, no references or examples are provided to support this idea. On the other hand, when comparing the computational cost between the algorithm with and without binary representations (lines 215-219), the same values for t and s are considered. This is not a fair comparison as both cases are not taking the same level of information. Additionally, I have serious doubts about the reduction in computational cost of the binary representatives. Then, in Algorithm 2, when searching for complementary features and opposing features, I can see a reduction in the cost of computing the mutual information (we are working with binary variables), but the cardinalities of S^bin U B[f] and S^bin are larger than in the non-binary case, as all the set B[f_best] is added to the set S^bin set in line 21. In short, it seems like there is a trade-off between the computational cost to compute the argmax and the mutual information. \u2022 Lines 180-182: If an \u201coptimal\u201d interaction-aware MI-based feature selection method is wanted and not a low dimensional approximation of G, the proposed method as a computational cost O(i^2), which is the same as RelaxMRMR. What are reasonable values for t and s? Please, clarify this point. \u2022 Please, rephrase/clarify lines 183-191. \u2022 I don\u2019t understand why the particular case t=s is described in Algorithm 1, and a generic algorithm is not provided. \u2022 Proposition 3. First sentence in Appendix A.4 needs clarification and it is fundamental for the correctness of Proposition 3 (\u201cProof. The calculation of a joint entropy of m variables over N requires takes O(mN) simple operations. Hence, any MI that involve m variables requires O(mN) simple operations as well.\u201d). \u2022 Line 249-250: \u201cbut estimation of\u2026. BR technique.\u201d Please clarify this sentence. Isn\u2019t it a problem-dependent factor? \u2022 Experimental setup. There is another critical point here. It is not clear whether the curves presented in Figure 1 are obtained over a validation/test set or over the training set. It is said later on that 10-fold cross-validation is applied to estimate the significance of differences in classification quality, but it is not clear whether this procedure was also applied in Figure 1.This must be clarified. \u2022 The proposed method does not provide good results for the NBC classifier; though these results are provided in the appendices, they are not mentioned or even discussed in the main paper. \u2022 There is relevant information in the appendices regarding the comparison between different feature selection methods. I think that the average results reported in the main manuscript are not enough. \u2022 Experiments. How can it be explained that the strongest competitor is CMIM, and not one of the interaction-aware FS methods? \u2022 It would be interesting to empirically compare CMICOT with and without binary representatives in terms of classification accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, it is highly advisable to include some comparisons with the other feature selection methods in terms of computational cost. It is especially critical to make it clear the advantage of the proposed method with respect to other interaction-aware SFS-based filters. \u2022 Minor comments: - Line 27: Should it be SFS-based filters instead of SBS-based filters? - Lines 144-145: clarify the sentence in cursive. - Missing axes labels in Figure 1. - Please, indicate the statistical test used in Table 1.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper describes an information theoretic feature selection algorithm which approximates a high order mutual information by decomposing categorical variables into binary variables. It further decomposes the high order mutual information into a search over two sets, one which finds the best complementary subset (in terms of increasing the information), and another which finds the subset that contains most of that information. Major comments: Statement 1 and the associated proof is unnecessary. When t & s are greater than the number of selected features then the maximum score that can be assigned to a variable is the mutual information between it combined with all the selected features against the target. Either all variables end up in H or they end up in G depending on how the search is done. This score is then rank equivalent to the CMI score. The behaviour of this criterion is only interesting when it's actually approximating the CMI (i.e. when t & s < i). The interplay between the max and min steps is very interesting. I would expect that most of the time G covers H, as this would minimise the information, but in the case of complementary features then it becomes very dependent on the search procedure. The use of the binary representations blows up the search space and allows the algorithm to tease out interesting interactions. The complexity analysis of the competitor techniques is strictly correct that they increase in computation as i increases, but this is only with a naive implementation. With a memoized implementation (e.g. in the FEAST toolbox used for the experimental study) there are O(d) mutual information calculations in each iteration so the computation does not grow over time, with O(kd) memory required and O(kd) mutual information calculations total. In CMICOT it doesn't appear that these information calculations can be memoized (as the binary features chosen can change) so the computational complexity will grow over time as discussed in the paper. The experimental study lacks a few details (k in k-NN, which multiclass Adaboost is used, what is the base learner for Adaboost and how many ensemble members). The notation in portions of the supplementary material is unclear. For example in the equation above line 21 each of the Gs is a different subset, so they should use different letters (or G' etc). Much of the detail relies on the fact that H and G can have a large intersection (or even H \\cup G) which essentially removes H from the mutual information. Minor comments: The proof of proposition 3 doesn't define a simple operation. Calculating a joint entropy requires iterating over all N datapoints and then over all the states of the joint variable, but this gives complexity O(N + |X|) rather than O(Nm) where |X| is the number of states. Separating out the results for poker, ranking and semeion would allow the reader to separate the binary approximation from the max/min criterion. Does the binary approximation improve performance by adding some noise or reduce performance by limiting the amount of information as compared to JMI or RelaxMRMR? With separate results for binary features vs non-binary features it might be possible to answer that question. As part of this it would be interesting to run all the other algorithms on the binary expanded versions of the datasets to see how that affected the performance.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper proposed a sequential forward selection style feature selection method which can identify high-order feature interactions. The authors also proposed binary representatives of features which makes their feature selection approach scalable. Empirical comparison is provided to support its superior performance. [Technical quality] The experimental methods are appropriate, but more empirical experiments can be added. Also I expect more analysis over the experiments. [Novelty/originality] The methodology contained in this paper is incremental. [Potential impact or usefulness] The potential impact of the work is not particular influential, but considering high-order interaction in feature selection is an important research question. [Clarity and presentation] I think the overall presentation of the paper is ok, but the notations can be misleading in some places. Although the authors states in Footnote 2 that I(f:g,h):=I(f;(g,h)), but I feel this abbreviation can lead to misunderstanding in many places. For example, in Section 3.1, it is much better to use I(c;{f,H}) rather than I(c;f,H). Also in their footnote 2, F={f_i}_{i=1}^{n} should be F=\\cup_{i=1}^{n}{f_i}.
