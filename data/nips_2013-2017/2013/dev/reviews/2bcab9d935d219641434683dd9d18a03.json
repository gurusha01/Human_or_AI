{"title": "Demixing odors - fast inference in olfaction", "abstract": "The olfactory system faces a difficult inference problem: it has to determine what odors are present based on the distributed activation of its receptor neurons. Here we derive neural implementations of two approximate inference algorithms that could be used by the brain. One is a variational algorithm (which builds on the work of Beck. et al., 2012), the other is based on sampling. Importantly, we use a more realistic prior distribution over odors than has been used in the past: we use a spike and slab'' prior, for which most odors have zero concentration. After mapping the two algorithms onto neural dynamics, we find that both can infer correct odors in less than 100 ms, although it takes ~500 ms to eliminate false positives. Thus, at the behavioral level, the two algorithms make very similar predictions. However, they make different assumptions about connectivity and neural computations, and make different predictions about neural activity. Thus, they should be distinguishable experimentally.  If so, that would provide insight into the mechanisms employed by the olfactory system, and, because the two algorithms use very different coding strategies, that would also provide insight into how networks represent probabilities.\"", "id": "2bcab9d935d219641434683dd9d18a03", "authors": ["Agnieszka Grabska-Barwinska", "Jeff Beck", "Alexandre Pouget", "Peter Latham"], "conference": "NIPS2013", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "This study investigates two algorithms for fast inference in generative models of olfaction. Their goal is to compute the most likely, linear mixture of odors comprising an olfactory stimulus. One of the algorithms employs variational inference, while the other is based on a sampling scheme. Simulations demonstrate that both algorithms perform suitably well, and the authors claim that inference is performed rapidly within the first 100 ms, while eliminating false positives (detection of odors not present in a particular stimulus) takes much longer and is difficult when more than two odors are present. As the inference schemes are fundamentally different, it is concluded that in an experiment, it would be possible to decide which of these alternatives is used by the brain. \n\nThe manuscript is nicely written and touches an interesting topic. The mathematical section is dense, but technically sound, and it makes realistic assumptions about the problem that the olfactory system has to solve. \n\nThe most problematic issue is the claim that inference can be performed within equally short time intervals as in the brain. It is based on the time constants introduced in equation 3.10 which are choosen to match neural time constants. However, on the right hand side of these DEQs there are many nonlinearities (log and exp) - and it is not clear whether a neural system would be able to perform these operations with the required precision in the time given by these time constants. Similar remarks also apply to the second, sampling-based algorithm. The authors state in the discussion that a realistic neural implementation would probably decrease performance, but I think that the problems with timing would be even more severe. \n\nA second issue which is partly unclear concerns the evaluation of the two models against experimental data, in particular if both models will be implemented as spike-based networks. Here, the discussion is a bit vague - what exactly has to be measured in order to distinguish between the sampling and variational inference hypothesis? \n\nIn summary, I think the manuscript is technically very interesting, but whether it provides a suitable approach to explain olfaction in the brain remains doubtful. \n\nMinor comments: \n\nFigure 1: the curves are barely distinguishable from the axes - try to use a logarithmic vertical axis, don't stretch the figure over the whole page. \n\nTypo, after Eq 3.11: auxillary variable \n\nTypo, remove full stop in sentence before Eq. 3.14 \n\nTypo, before Eq. 3.17: for each odour \n An analysis of two algorithms for fast inference in generative models of olfaction is presented.

A simple probabilistic model is defined and two inference algorithms are proposed: one based on variational inference and another based on sampling. Dynamical update rules are derived in order to formulate these algorithms in a neurally plausible manner. The biological feasibility of these two algorithms is then assessed using simulated data. The authors conclude that either algorithm could hypothetically work within natural time constraints, and that the methods would be distinguishable based on observed firing patterns. \n\nThis paper focuses on a popular theme at NIPS and within the broader computational neuroscience community, namely whether and how probabilistic reasoning and computation could be performed in neural systems. The authors extend a probabilistic model for olfaction introduced at NIPS 2012 (Beck et. al. [1]) by introducing a spike-and-slab prior over odor concentrations, and introduce two novel inference algorithms. Bayesian inference in these models is nontrivial, so developing neurally-plausible implementations of such algorithms is a challenge. The authors use a variety of interesting approaches to the problem of olfactory inference and develop novel and insightful proposals. \n\nThe primary conclusion of this paper is that variational inference and sampling could both hypothetically work, but the authors provide little corroborating biological evidence to suggest that either is actually employed in real systems, or that the implementation-level requirements imposed by these algorithms are reasonable expectations for biological systems. A further assessment of the computational and anatomical constraints imposed by these algorithms is left open for future work. \n\nThe inference algorithms proposed here are substantially different from other sampling-based approaches and contribute interesting ideas to the growing literature on probabilistic inference in neural circuits. However, it remains to be seen whether biological or experimental evidence can be found for probabilistic inference in olfactory systems. This paper builds on existing work by introducing a more reasonable probabilistic model and two novel inference algorithms for olfaction. Though technically sound and theoretically interesting, the biological constraints required to realize these algorithms in neural systems are substantial.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
