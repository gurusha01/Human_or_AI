      "text" : "Principal components analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for unsupervised dimension reduction that has a wide range of application—science, engineering, and any place where multivariate data is abundant. PCA uses the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix to compute the linear combinations of variables with the largest variance. These principal directions of variation explain the covariation of the variables and can be exploited for dimension reduction. In contemporary applications where variables are plentiful (large p) but samples are relatively scarce (small n), PCA suffers from two major weaknesses : 1) the interpretability and subsequent use of the principal directions is hindered by their dependence on all of the variables; 2) it is generally inconsistent in high-dimensions, i.e. the estimated principal directions can be noisy and unreliable [see 2, and the references therein].\nOver the past decade, there has been a fever of activity to address the drawbacks of PCA with a class of techniques called sparse PCA that combine the essence of PCA with the assumption that the phenomena of interest depend mostly on a few variables. Examples include algorithmic [e.g., 1, 3–10] and theoretical [e.g., 11–14] developments. However, much of this work has focused on the first principal component. One rationale behind this focus is by analogy with ordinary PCA: additional components can be found by iteratively deflating the input matrix to account for variation uncovered by previous components. However, the use of deflation with sparse PCA entails complications of non-orthogonality, sub-optimality, and multiple tuning parameters [15]. Identifiability and consistency present more subtle issues. The principal directions of variation correspond to eigenvectors of some population matrix Σ. There is no reason to assume a priori that the d largest eigenvalues\nof Σ are distinct. Even if the eigenvalues are distinct, estimates of individual eigenvectors can be unreliable if the gap between their eigenvalues is small. So it seems reasonable, if not necessary, to de-emphasize eigenvectors and to instead focus on their span, i.e. the principal subspace of variation.\nThere has been relatively little work on the problem of estimating the principal subspace or even multiple eigenvectors simultaneously. Most works that do are limited to iterative deflation schemes or optimization problems whose global solution is intractable to compute. Sole exceptions are the diagonal thresholding method [2], which is just ordinary PCA applied to the subset of variables with largest marginal sample variance, or refinements such as iterative thresholding [16], which use diagonal thresholding as an initial estimate. These works are limited, because they cannot be used when the variables have equal variances (e.g., correlation matrices). Theoretical results are equally limited in their applicability. Although the optimal minimax rates for the sparse principal subspace problem are known in both the spiked [17] and general [18] covariance models, existing statistical guarantees only hold under the restrictive spiked covariance model, which essentially guarantees that diagonal thresholding has good properties, or for estimators that are computationally intractable.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel convex optimization problem to estimate the d-dimensional principal subspace of a population matrix Σ based on a noisy input matrix S. We show that if S is a sample covariance matrix and the projection Π of the d-dimensional principal subspace of Σ depends only on s variables, then with a suitable choice of regularization parameter, the Frobenius norm of the error of our estimator X̂ is bounded with high probability\n|||X̂ −Π|||2 = O ( (λ1/δ)s √ log p/n )\nwhere λ1 is the largest eigenvalue of Σ and δ the gap between the dth and (d + 1)th largest eigenvalues of Σ. This rate turns out to be nearly minimax optimal (Corollary 3.3), and under additional assumptions on signal strength, it also allows us to recover the support of the principal subspace (Theorem 3.2). Moreover, we provide easy to verify conditions (Theorem 3.3) that yield nearoptimal statistical guarantees for other choices of input matrix, such as Pearson’s correlation and Kendall’s tau correlation matrices (Corollary 3.4).\nOur estimator turns out to be a semidefinite program (SDP) that generalizes the DSPCA approach of [1] to d ≥ 1 dimensions. It is based on a convex body, called the Fantope, that provides a tight relaxation for simultaneous rank and orthogonality constraints on the positive semidefinite cone. Solving the SDP is non-trivial. We find that an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm [e.g., 19] can efficiently compute its global optimum (Section 4).\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows.\n1. We formulate the sparse principal subspace problem as a novel semidefinite program with a Fantope constraint (Section 2).\n2. We show that the proposed estimator achieves a near optimal rate of convergence in subspace estimation without assumptions on the rank of the solution or restrictive spiked covariance models. This is a first for both d = 1 and d > 1 (Section 3).\n3. We provide a general theoretical framework that accommodates other matrices, in addition to sample covariance, such as Pearson’s correlation and Kendall’s tau.\n4. We develop an efficient ADMM algorithm to solve the SDP (Section 4), and provide numerical examples that demonstrate the superiority of our approach over deflation methods in both computational and statistical efficiency (Section 5).\nThe remainder of the paper explains each of these contributions in detail, but we defer all proofs to Appendix A.\nRelated work Existing work most closely related to ours is the DSPCA approach for single component sparse PCA that was first proposed in [1]. Subsequently, there has been theoretical analysis under a spiked covariance model and restrictions on the entries of the eigenvectors [11], and algorithmic developments including block coordinate ascent [9] and ADMM [20]. The crucial difference with our work is that this previous work only considered d = 1. The d > 1 case requires invention and novel techniques to deal with a convex body, the Fantope, that has never before been used in sparse PCA.\nNotation For matrices A,B of compatible dimension ⟨A,B⟩ := tr(ATB) is the Frobenius inner product, and |||A|||22 := ⟨A,A⟩ is the squared Frobenius norm. ∥x∥q is the usual ℓq norm with ∥x∥0 defined as the number of nonzero entries of x. ∥A∥a,b is the (a, b)-norm defined to be the ℓb norm of the vector of rowwise ℓa norms of A, e.g. ∥A∥1,∞ is the maximum absolute row sum. For a symmetric matrix A, we define λ1(A) ≥ λ2(A) ≥ · · · to be the eigenvalues of A with multiplicity. When the context is obvious we write λj := λj(A) as shorthand. For two subspaces M1 and M2, sinΘ(M1,M2) is defined to be the matrix whose diagonals are the sines of the canonical angles between the two subspaces [see 21, §VII]."

      "text" : "Given a symmetric input matrix S, we propose a sparse principal subspace estimator X̂ that is defined to be a solution of the semidefinite program\nmaximize ⟨S,X⟩ − λ∥X∥1,1 subject to X ∈ Fd,\n(1)\nin the variable X , where Fd := { X : 0 ≼ X ≼ I and tr(X) = d }\nis a convex body called the Fantope [22, §2.3.2], and λ ≥ 0 is a regularization parameter that encourages sparsity. When d = 1, the spectral norm bound in Fd is redundant and (1) reduces to the DSPCA approach of [1]. The motivation behind (1) is based on two key insights.\nThe first insight is a variational characterization of the principal subspace of a symmetric matrix. The sum of the d largest eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix A can be expressed as\nd∑\ni=1\nλi(A) (a) = max V TV=Id ⟨A, V V T ⟩ (b)= max X∈Fd ⟨A,X⟩ . (2)\nIdentity (a) is an extremal property known as Ky Fan’s maximum principle [23]; (b) is based on the less well known observation that\nFd = conv({V V T : V TV = Id}) , i.e. the extremal points of Fd are the rank-d projection matrices. See [24] for proofs of both. The second insight is a connection between the (1, 1)-norm and a notion of subspace sparsity introduced by [18]. Any X ≽ 0 can be factorized (non-uniquely) as X = V V T . Lemma 2.1. If X = V V T , then ∥X∥1,1 ≤ ∥V ∥ 2 2,1 ≤ ∥V ∥ 2 2,0 tr(X).\nConsequently, any X ∈ Fd that has at most s non-zero rows necessarily has ∥X∥1,1 ≤ s2d. Thus, ∥X∥1,1 is a convex relaxation of what [18] call row sparsity for subspaces.\nThese two insights reveal that (1) is a semidefinite relaxation of the non-convex problem\nmaximize ⟨S, V V T ⟩ − λ∥V ∥22,0d\nsubject to V TV = Id . [18] proposed solving an equivalent form of the above optimization problem and showed that the estimator corresponding to its global solution is minimax rate optimal under a general statistical model for S. Their estimator requires solving an NP-hard problem. The advantage of (1) is that it is computationally tractable.\nSubspace estimation The constraint X̂ ∈ Fd guarantees that its rank is≥ d. However X̂ need not be an extremal point of Fd, i.e. a rank-d projection matrix. In order to obtain a proper d-dimensional subspace estimate, we can extract the d leading eigenvectors of X̂ , say V̂ , and form the projection matrix Π̂ = V̂ V̂ T . The projection is unique, but the choice of basis is arbitrary. We can follow the convention of standard PCA by choosing an orthogonal matrix O so that (V̂ O)TS(V̂ O) is diagonal, and take V̂ O as the orthonormal basis for the subspace estimate."

Assumption 1 (Symmetry). S and Σ are p× p symmetric matrices. Assumption 2 (Identifiability). δ = δ(Σ) = λd(Σ)− λd+1(Σ) > 0. Assumption 3 (Sparsity). The projection Π onto the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of Σ corresponding to its d largest eigenvalues satisfies ∥Π∥2,0 ≤ s, or equivalently, ∥diag(Π)∥0 ≤ s.\nThe key result (Theorem 3.1 below) implies that the statistical properties of the error of the estimator\n∆ := X̂ −Π ,\ncan be derived, in many cases, by routine analysis of the entrywise errors of the input matrix\nW := S − Σ .\nThere are two main ideas in our analysis of X̂ . The first is relating the difference in the values of the objective function in (1) at Π and X̂ to ∆. The second is exploiting the decomposability of the regularizer. Conceptually, this is the same approach taken by [25] in analyzing the statistical properties of regularized M -estimators. It is worth noting that the curvature result in our problem comes from the geometry of the constraint set in (1). It is different from the “restricted strong convexity” in [25], a notion of curvature tailored for regularization in the form of penalizing an unconstrained convex objective."

This means that typical applications of the Davis-Kahan Theorem require the additional invocation of Weyl’s Theorem. Our primary use of this result is to show that even if rank(X̂) ̸= d, its principal subspace will be close to that of Π if ∆ is small. Corollary 3.2 (Subspace error bound).

      "text" : "In this section we use Theorem 3.1 to derive the statistical properties of X̂ in a generic setting where the entries of W uniformly obey a restricted sub-Gaussian deviation inequality. This is not the most general result possible, but it allows us to illustrate the statistical properties of X̂ for two different types of input matrices: sample covariance and Kendall’s tau correlation. The former is the standard input for PCA; the latter has recently been shown to be a useful robust and nonparametric tool for high-dimensional graphical models [26]. Theorem 3.3 (General statistical error bound). If there exists σ > 0 and n > 0 such that Σ and S satisfy\nmax ij\nP ( |Sij − Σij | ≥ t ) ≤ 2 exp ( − 4nt2/σ2 ) (3)\nfor all t ≤ σ and λ = σ √ log p/n ≤ σ , (4)\nthen |||X̂ −Π|||2 ≤ 4σ δ s √ log p/n with probability at least 1− 2/p2.\nSample covariance Consider the setting where the input matrix is the sample covariance matrix of a random sample of size n > 1 from a sub-Gaussian distribution. A random vector Y with Σ = Var(Y ) has sub-Gaussian distribution if there exists a constant L > 0 such that\nP ( |⟨Y − EY, u⟩| ≥ t ) ≤ exp ( − Lt2/∥Σ1/2u∥22 ) (5)\nfor all u and t ≥ 0. Under this condition we have the following corollary of Theorem 3.3. Corollary 3.3. Let S be the sample covariance matrix of an i.i.d. sample of size n > 1 from a sub-Gaussian distribution (5) with population covariance matrix Σ. If λ is chosen to satisfy (4) with σ = cλ1, then\n|||X̂ −Π|||2 ≤ C λ1 δ s √ log p/n\nwith probablity at least 1− 2/p2, where c, C are constants depending only on L.\nComparing with the minimax lower bounds derived in [17, 18], we see that the rate in Corollary 3.3 is roughly larger than the optimal minimax rate by a factor of√\nλ1/λd+1 · √\ns/d The first term only becomes important in the near-degenerate case where λd+1 ≪ λ1. It is possible with much more technical work to get sharp dependence on the eigenvalues, but we prefer to retain brevity and clarity in our proof of the version here. The second term is likely to be unimprovable without additional conditions on S and Σ such as a spiked covariance model. Very recently, [14] showed in a testing framework with similar assumptions as ours when d = 1 that the extra factor√ s is necessary for any polynomial time procedure if the planted clique problem cannot be solved in randomized polynomial time.\nKendall’s tau Kendall’s tau correlation provides a robust and nonparametric alternative to ordinary (Pearson) correlation. Given an n × p matrix whose rows are i.i.d. p-variate random vectors, the theoretical and empirical versions of Kendall’s tau correlation matrix are\nτij := Cor ( sign(Y1i − Y2i) , sign(Y1j − Y2j) )\nτ̂ij := 2 n(n− 1) ∑\ns<t\nsign(Ysi − Yti) sign(Ysj − Ytj) .\nA key feature of Kendall’s tau is that it is invariant under strictly monotone transformations, i.e. sign(Ysi − Yti) sign(Ysj − Ytj)) = sign(fi(Ysi)− fi(Yti)) sign(fj(Ysj)− fj(Ytj)) ,\nwhere fi, fj are strictly monotone transformations. When Y is multivariate Gaussian, there is also a one-to-one correspondence between τij and ρij = Cor(Y1i, Y1j) [27] :\nτij = 2\nπ arcsin(ρij) . (6)\nThese two observations led [26] to propose using\nT̂ij =\n{ sin ( π 2 τ̂ij ) if i ̸= j\n1 if i = j . (7)\nas an input matrix to Gaussian graphical model estimators in order to extend the applicability of those procedures to the wider class of nonparanormal distributions [28]. This same idea was extended to sparse PCA by [29]; they proposed and analyzed using T̂ as an input matrix to the non-convex sparse PCA procedure of [13]. A shortcoming of that approach is that their theoretical guarantees only hold for the global solution of an NP-hard optimization problem. The following corollary of Theorem 3.3 rectifies the situation by showing that X̂ with Kendall’s tau is nearly optimal.\nCorollary 3.4. Let S = T̂ as defined in (7) for an i.i.d. sample of size n > 1 and let Σ = T be the analogous quantity with τij in place of τ̂ij . If λ is chosen to satisfy (4) with σ = √ 8π, then\n|||X̂ −Π|||2 ≤ 8 √ 2π δ s √ log p/n\nwith probablity at least 1− 2/p2.\nNote that Corollary 3.4 only requires that τ̂ be computed from an i.i.d. sample. It does not specify the marginal distribution of the observations. So Σ = T is not necessarily positive semidefinite and may be difficult to interpret. However, under additional conditions, the following lemma gives meaning to T by extending (6) to a wide class of distributions, called transelliptical by [29], that includes the nonparanormal. See [29, 30] for further information. Lemma ([29, 30]). If (Y11, . . . , Y1p) has continuous distribution and there exist monotone transformations f1, . . . , fp such that (\nf1(Y11), . . . , fp(Y1p) )\nhas elliptical distribution with scatter matrix Σ̃, then\nTij = Σ̃ij/ √ Σ̃iiΣ̃jj .\nMoreover, if fj(Y1j), j = 1, . . . , p have finite variance, then Tij = Cor ( fi(Y1i), fj(Y1j) ) .\nThis lemma together with Corollary 3.4 shows that Kendall’s tau can be used in place of the sample correlation matrix for a wide class of distributions without much loss of efficiency."

These methods obtain multiple component estimates by taking the kth component estimate v̂k from input matrix Sk, and then re-running the method with the deflated input matrix: Sk+1 = (I − v̂kv̂Tk )Sk(I − v̂kv̂Tk ). The resulting d-dimensional principal subspace estimate is the span of v̂1, . . . , v̂d. Tuning parameter selection can be much more complicated for these iterative deflation methods.

We considered two different types of sparse Π = V V T of rank d = 5: those with disjoint support for the nonzero entries of the\ncolumns of V and those with shared support. We generated V by sampling its nonzero entries from a standard Gaussian distribution and then orthnormalizing V while retaining the desired sparsity pattern.

We then embedded Π inside the population covariance matrix Σ = αΠ + (I − Π)Σ0(I − Π), where Σ0 is a Wishart matrix with p degrees of freedom and α > 0 is chosen so that the effective noise level (in the optimal minimax rate [18]), σ2 = √ λ1λd+1/(λd − λd+1) ∈ {1, 10}.\nFigure 1 summarizes the resulting mean squared error |||Π̂ − Π|||22 across 100 replicates for each of the different combinations of simulation parameters.

It is clear that regularization is beneficial, because all the methods have significantly smaller MSE than standard PCA when they are sufficiently sparse.

We establish a near-optimal convergence rate, in terms of the sparsity, ambient dimension, and sample size, for estimation of the principal subspace of a general covariance matrix without assuming the spiked covariance model. In the special case of d = 1, our result implies the near-optimality of DSPCA (d’Aspremont et al. [1]) even when the solution is not rank 1. We also provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing the statistical properties of the method for arbitrary input matrices that extends the applicability and provable guarantees to a wide array of settings.
