{"title": "Sparse nonnegative deconvolution for compressive calcium imaging: algorithms and phase transitions", "abstract": "We propose a compressed sensing (CS) calcium imaging framework for monitoring large neuronal populations, where we image randomized projections of the spatial calcium concentration at each timestep, instead of measuring the concentration at individual locations. We develop scalable nonnegative deconvolution methods for extracting the neuronal spike time series from such observations. We also address the problem of demixing the spatial locations of the neurons using rank-penalized matrix factorization methods. By exploiting the sparsity of neural spiking we demonstrate that the number of measurements needed per timestep is significantly smaller than the total number of neurons, a result that can potentially enable imaging of larger populations at considerably faster rates compared to traditional raster-scanning techniques. Unlike traditional CS setups, our problem involves a block-diagonal sensing matrix and a non-orthogonal sparse basis that spans multiple timesteps. We study the effect of these distinctive features in a noiseless setup using recent results relating conic geometry to CS. We provide tight approximations to the number of measurements needed for perfect deconvolution for certain classes of spiking processes, and show that this number displays a phase transition,\" similar to phenomena observed in more standard CS settings; however, in this case the required measurement rate depends not just on the mean sparsity level but also on other details of the underlying spiking process.\"", "id": "5e9f92a01c986bafcabbafd145520b13", "authors": ["Eftychios A.

The method reduces the number of measurements significantly and uses recently developed mathematical techniques to decode these measurements. Furthermore, the number of measurements necessary for full recovery is studied using cutting-edge mathematical techniques. \n\nThe strength of the paper is in the application of fashionable mathematical techniques to address an important neuroscience problem. The weakness of the paper is that no analysis of actual data is presented. I realize that the required datasets may not yet exist. However, expecting that an experimentalist would be able to read this paper and develop a compressive sensing imaging protocol seems a bit unrealistic to me. I think that the key idea could be communicated on a much simpler level than that of the current presentation. \n Modern treatment of compressive sensing calcium imaging", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "2-photon calcium population imaging has made it possible to record from large populations of neurons, but given that only one voxel can be imaged at any time, there are still inevitable trade-offs between temporal resolution and population size. This paper proposes to use techniques from compressive sensing (which, as the authors describe, have by now been utilized in a variety of other imaging settings, including confocal fluorescence imaging) for neural population imaging-- this approach promises to use voxel measurements more effectively, and thus opens the possibility of recording from much larger populations. \n\nThe authors set up a simple linear model of the measurement process with fixed baseline, AR(1) temporal dependence and binary spikes, and spell out both a 'standard' reconstruction algorithm for it and also one which simultaneously estimates the locations of neurons, and analyze both algorithms using simulation and theory (only for the 'standard' approach).') \n\n\nDetailed comments: \na) The paper seems a bit disjointed jumping between the 'known locations' and 'unknown locations' cases-- I think concentrating on the 'known locations' case and using the additional space to provide more details would have made for a stronger and more readable paper. \nb) The weights are +-1 in the imaging matrix B-- is it possible to image 'negatively', and if not, how does this affect the applicability of the approach? \nc) Neural activity is sparse but (might be) synchronized in time-- how would this affect the applicability of the method? \n\n\nQuality: While there are open questions as to whether and how well this works on real data, the analysis and methods provided are sound (although I am in no position to comment on the rigour of the theory). The theory seems a bit disjoint from the simulation results. \nClarity: This is a dense paper, and there are not really enough details to understand the theory. It would probably have made for a stronger to concentrate on a few points and work them out more clearly. \nOriginality: While CS imaging has been performed in other imaging domains, to my knowledge, this is the first application to 2 photon calcium imaging. \nSignificance: This is a conceptual and even speculative paper-- however, if this method is really successfully put into practice, the impact could be dramatic. \n\n This paper proposes a new algorithmic framework for calcium imaging based on randomized measurements, and shows hat such an approach has potential to allow neural population measurements to be scaled to larger population sizes than previously possible. While the paper seems a bit `conceptual' and there are open questions regarding the applibility of this approach to real data, the idea is very interesting and potentially powerful, and therefore a great paper for NIPS.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "[EDIT] I read the rebuttal and removed point 3 from my review since it has been sufficiently addressed. Although I'm still not 100% happy with the responses to points 1 and 2 I upped the score to 8. \n\n\nThe authors propose a framework for two-photon imaging based on compressed sensing. In the first half of the paper they use simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of estimating calcium traces, non-negative firing rates (closely corresponding to spike times in a high-SNR situation) and spatial intensity profiles of the imaged neurons based on random projections of the data. In the second part they show that in the noiseless case the quality of reconstruction undergoes a phase transition. They derive an approximation to the phase transition curve, which they show to be quite accurate under some conditions. \n\nI am generally enthusiastic about the approach since it could have a lot of potential to substantially improve the efficiency of two-photon imaging experiments, which generally suffer from the inherent trade-off between data quality and number of neurons that can be imaged. Although I am unable to verify the math, in particular in section 3, judging from the successful verification through simulations I believe it's correct. \n\nBesides the stylistic complaint that the paper is written in a rather technical way with a lot of jargon, my major concern is that the authors did not do a good job at convincing the reader that the approach will actually be feasible or even useful in practice. There are three main issues related to this concern: \n\n1. Since the method is sensitive to noise (Fig. 1) it is important to test it with realistic noise levels. In practice, noise levels are very high with calcium imaging due to shot noise, in particular so if one images fast as the authors propose. Although I don't know for sure what a typical SNR (as defined in line 189) would be for a real experiment, my guess would be that it's closer to 0 dB than to 20 dB as used in the Fig. 1 and I wouldn't be surprised if it's even substantially lower than 0 dB. Since this is a very fundamental problem, the authors should present some convincing evidence that the SNRs they use are realistic. \n\n2. For estimating the locations, it looks like although the neurons were overlapping there was no background (neuropil) activity between the neurons and the neurons were actually covering the major fraction of the imaged space. However, in practice the situation is dramatically different. In a 3d volume cell bodies make up at most 10% (probably less) of the voxels while the remainder consists of neuropil (axons and dendrites), which display calcium activity as well (although usually highly correlated and with faster dynamics). Although I would guess that the result would be a few (large) singular values that could be excluded based on their spatial profile, I cannot judge whether the algorithm (P-NN) is really not affected in a major way by this. In addition, using SVD to identify neurons assumes they fire uncorrelated, which is unlikely to be true for most experiments. Since one of the main goals of imaging many neurons at the same time is to characterize their joint activity, this could be a major caveat and should at least be discussed. \n\n[3. removed since clarified by rebuttal] \n\nThe above concerns would be somewhat less of a problem if the goal of the paper was to just lay out the basic mathematical framework, but then the authors should be more upfront about the various practical problems that may arise. Currently, the manuscripts reads somewhat like the method could be used to build an actual imaging setup, but I think we are still relatively far away from that goal. Potentially very interesting approach to calcium imaging based on compressed sensing, but the practical feasibility is somewhat questionable and could be better addressed.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
