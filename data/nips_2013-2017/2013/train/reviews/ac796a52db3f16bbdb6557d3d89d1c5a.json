{"title": "Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification", "abstract": "We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive fields in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identification of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identified. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identification algorithms.", "id": "ac796a52db3f16bbdb6557d3d89d1c5a", "authors": ["Aurel A.

The present paper is motivated by the recent realization within the neuroscience community that most sensory processing is in multi-modal, and that this occurs already at early stages of the processing hierarchy. The signal processing advantages of such a scheme are intuitively obvious, and the present paper contributes to demonstrating a practical and mathematically well-founded approach. Such an approach offers the potential advantage of natural hardware implementation using low power elements. \nThe mathematical framework for signal representation is based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, specifically focusing here on trigonometric functions. The main mathematical contributions appear in the form of two theorems, which establish, respectively, the decoding property and the equivalence of filter identification and neural encoding. Several examples are also presented which demonstrate the effectiveness and power of the method. \nThis paper deals with an important and relevant problem in computational neuroscience (and signal processing) and suggests a solid and effective solution. Although the method proposed does not seem to be biologically plausible form an algorithmic perspective, it does suggest limits to what can be achieved with the setting delineated. I was missing some discussion of robustness to noise and power consumption considerations, which was one of the motivations for the paper. \n An extension of previous work providing a framework for encoding and decoding multi-sensory continuous signals in the spike domain.

The sufficient condition is to have a large enough population of (different) neurons: N >= SUM_m[(2L_1+1)(2L_2+1)\u2026(2L_{n_m-1} + 1)]. The necessary condition is that the total number of spikes is greater than \n(2L_{n_m}+1)*SUM_m[(2L_1+1)(2L_2+1)\u2026(2L_{n_m-1} + 1)] +N\" \n\nOK, that seems more acceptable, even though I don't fully understand the condition -- what prevents these spikes from being completely synchronized across neurons, and hence being uninformative? \n\n'\"\u2026what would happen if all filter kernels were the same? Then no matter how many neurons you added, you would not gain any further information.\u201d \nThat is not entirely correct. For example, if all filters are Dirac-delta functions, the inputs are encoded directly without processing. However, one can recover all inputs if the neurons have different parameters (e.g., bias, capacitance, threshold of the IAF neuron). Imposing linear independence between kernels is another way to guarantee signal recovery.' \n\nTrue, but in your definition of the IAF-TEM (eqn3 and following) it does not appear that the neurons have different parameters, hence my remark. Please say that somewhere. \n\n\nReview for \"Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification\" \n\nThe paper describes an extension of Time Encoding Machines (TEM) to the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) setting, using the formalism of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RHKS). The approach is motivated from a neuroscientific perspective: in the introduction, it is claimed (correctly) that multisensory integration (and processing) provides many benefits to organisms, but that it is still poorly understood. What follows is a particular extension of TEMs \nto the MIMO setting, with trignometric polynomials as basis functions. Necessary conditions for perfect decoding and/or system identification are given. The feasibility of the resulting algorithms are demonstrated on an audio/video decoding task, and an audio/video encoder identification task. The paper concludes with the remark that this work constitutes the first tractable computational model for multisensory integration (which is wrong) and that extensions to the noisy case would be straightforward. \n\nClarity: \nThe paper is mostly well written, even though the notation in section 3 is cumbersome, but I do not see how that could be avoided. \n\nOriginality: the paper's most original contribution is the extensions of TEMs to the MIMO setting, the connection to the brain is tenuous. \n\nQuality: I believe some parts of the paper need to be improved before publication. \n\nSignificance: from a technical perspective, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of TEMs for multi-modal encoding, which might prove useful. \nThere is no clear contribution to neural coding, other than the motivation in the introduction. \n\n\nDetailed comments: \n\nline 100: \"bandlmited\" -> bandlimited \n\nline 137: j is the complex unit, please say that somewhere. \n\nline 144: the u_n in eqn.(1) are not the same as the u_n^i in figure 1, right? I propose to use a different letter. \n\nline 166: \"BIBO-stable\" bounded-input-bounded-output? please define. \n\nline 166: \"...finite temporal support of lenghth S_i \\leq T_i...\": would that be spatio-temporal support for the video filters in example 2? \n\nline 177: Say here that the h_{l_1 \\ldots l_n} are the filter coefficients, to connect this formula to theorem 1. \n\nline 182: \"...IAF TEM...\": IAF=\"integrate and fire\"? Please specify. \n\nline 185: eqn. 3: what is the index k? From other literature about IAF-TEMs, I would infer that it's the spike index? If that is correct, please also say that t_k is a spike time, and that these are strictly monotonically increasing with k etc. In fact, it would be very useful if there was a short introduction to IAF-TEMs: up to here, the paper only talks about continuous signals, now spikes are introduced (if I interpret everything correctly). \n\nline 195-195: \"Then there exists a number N ... can be perfectly recovered\" this sounds like a sufficient condition. But in the proof of this theorem 1, line 224ff: \"A necessary condition for the latter (solvability)....\" so you only show a necessary condition? Hence, theorem 1 remains unproven, I think. In fact, I wonder what would happen if all filter kernels were the same? Then no matter how many neurons you added, you would not gain any further information, thus the signal recovery would not improve. To remedy this, I think the kernels would have to be constrained by some sort of linear independence condition, similar to [15]. \n\nfigures 1,2,4: the v_i do not appear anywhere else in the paper. Please clarify their purpose. \n\nsection 5, examples. The examples are instructive. But I wonder why you did not choose a real video+audio for the examples -- it would have strengthened the connection to neuroscience \nif you showed that your approach works on relevant datasets. \n\nline 417: \"...the first tractable computation model for multisensory integration...\" wrong, see e.g. the works by Wei & Koerding, or Ernst & Banks. Please remove this sentence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The extension of TEMs to the MIMO setting might be interesting for technical applications and decoding in Neuroscience.
