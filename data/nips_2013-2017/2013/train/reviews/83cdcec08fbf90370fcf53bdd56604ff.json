If the graph is k-anonymized, the compatibility graph forms k-regular bipartite graph. \nExisting k-anonimity requires that k-anonymous records should form a graph with fully-connected k-cliques. \nThe authors extend the notion of k-anonymity to b-matching anonymity so that the compatibility graph forms a k-regular bipartite graph. \nThis relaxation provides adaptive anonymity, in that each record is allowed to set the anonymity parameter independently with respect to the desired privacy revel . \nThe contribution of the authors are: \n(1) polynomial algorithms to find b-maching anonymized records by alternate execution of the max-flow algorithm (if my understanding is correct) and minimization of a variational upper bound \n(2)characterization of the b-maching anonymity against adversaries who know a limited number of edges \n(3) empirical evaluation of the utility \n\nThe paper is well organized; notions and theorems are clearly stated. \nNotions similar to b-matching anonymity are introduced by a couple of papers (e.g., [A] and [B]); relations between them should be mentioned in the paper. \nCharacterization of b-maching anonymity against adversaries with background knowledge seems to be quite new and opens up a new vista in this field. \nI personally think this is a paper for STOC or FOCS and I am not sure if NIPS readers are interested in this paper. \n\n[A]Mingqiang Xue, Panagiotis Karras, Chedy Ra\u00efssi, Jaideep Vaidya, Kian-Lee Tan: Anonymizing set-valued data by nonreciprocal recoding.

The authors explain the concepts of k-anonymity and the b-matching problem as forming a bipartite graph that describes the compatibility of the original dataset with the released dataset. They provide two algorithms, for the asymmetric and symmetric cases, which are justified as variational approximations of the star (suppression) minimization problem. There is an approximation result for the algorithms. A variety of privacy guarantees are provided for single attacks,and sustained attacks on the k-clique construction, symmetric and asymmetric b-matchings. A brief experimental section is provided with some convincing results. \n\nThis paper is of high quality, as it comprehensively addresses the b-matching problem and provides strong computationally feasible algorithms that are well justified. It is very well written with a very understandable introduction and exposition. The algorithmic results are strong, as are the privacy guarantees. It is likely to be a significant work, as b-matching is a significant extension of the k-anonymity, while being a reasonable alternative to other notions of privacy. Furthermore, this work is very general, allowing for user specified levels of privacy and addressing both the symmetric and asymmetric cases. The only criticism is that theorem 1 is quite weak as an approximation factor of the degree makes it nearly useless. I think that an explanation (at least in the appendix) of how the algorithms are a variational upper bound of the ideal program would be more convincing. \n\nMinor comments: \n191 - 'a more general' -> 'a general' \n263 - use `` not '' \ndef 4.1 - this is confusing, how does the matching come in to the symmetry notion here This paper comprehensively addresses the b-matching problem for k-anonymous privacy, providing strong privacy guarantees and sophisticated novel algorithms. I strongly recommend its acceptance as it promises to be an important study of k-anonymity through b-matching.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
