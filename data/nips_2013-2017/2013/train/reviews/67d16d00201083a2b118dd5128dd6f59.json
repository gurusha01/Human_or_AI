{"title": "Gaussian Process Conditional Copulas with Applications to Financial Time Series", "abstract": "The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be innacurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods.", "id": "67d16d00201083a2b118dd5128dd6f59", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato", "James R.

The copula parameters are related to conditioning variables by a composition of parameter mapping functions and arbitrary latent functions with Gaussian process priors. The inference procedure for this model is based on expectation propagation. The method is evaluated on synthetic data and on financial time series data and compared to alternative copula-based models. The paper also includes an overview of related methods. \n\n\nQuality: \n\nThe proposed method is sound. The authors include a description of related methods and list strengths and weaknesses of their method. \n\n\nClarity: \n\nThe paper is written clearly and concisely. It makes a very mature impression. I could not find any inconsistencies or typos. The figures and tables complement the text seamlessly, equations are clear and well explained and the text is flawless. \n\n\nOriginality: \n\nThe model and its inference procedure is an extension of a similar conditional copula model that was restricted to copulas with only one parameter. The present work generalizes this approach to allow more than one copula parameter. To my knowledge, this extension is novel. \n\n\nSignificance: \n\nThe flexibility of copula families with only one parameter is limited and the applicability of more flexible families is a huge advantage. Performance gains compared to the alternative methods are remarkable. This result is very promising. \n The paper extends an inference procedure for conditional copula models. The contribution is important and well done.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper presents an interesting approach for modeling dependences between variables based on Gaussian process conditional copulas. It employs Gaussian process priors on the latent functions to model their interactions. Then an alternating EP algorithm is proposed for the approximate Bayesian inference. Experimental results on both synthetic data and two realworld data indicate the better performance of conditional copula models, especially the one based on student t copula. \n\nIn general, this paper is well written and perhaps useful for dependence modeling in time series data. The EP inference is also implementable for the posterior distribution in the paper. A major problem of this paper is that some details are missing: \n(1) How the parameters in the copula model (e.g., \\alpha, \\beta, \\omega for the Symmetrized Joe Clayton Copula) in are calculated? I assume this paper sets them to constants. How to choose them for a given time series data? \n(2) The details of the parameters the exponential covariance function in Gaussian process are missing. \n(3) How to choose the number of latent functions k? \n\n\n This paper discusses an interesting topic and derives an implementable inference method. However, some details on the parameter settings are missing.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper tackles the problem of fitting conditional copula models. The paper goes beyond typical constant copula functions and aim to model cases where parameters of the copula are functions of other (time) varying aspects of the problem. \n\nThe core solution is essentially modeling the parameters space as Gaussian Processes. Starting from a Gaussian Process prior, the information from observed data are incorporated via Expectation Propagation for approximate inference of the posterior distribution. \n\nThe paper is extremely well written and easy to follow. The problem is well motivated and most importantly illustrations with HMM based and multivariate time series copulas are very nicely written. The experiments are sufficient as well. Overall, this is a nice paper that motivates a novel problem and provides a reasonable solution with excellent experimental illustrations.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
