{"title": "Context-sensitive active sensing in humans", "abstract": "Humans and animals readily utilize active sensing, or the use of self-motion, to focus sensory and cognitive resources on the behaviorally most relevant stimuli and events in the environment. Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artificial systems. Recently, a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, termed C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller), was proposed (Ahmad &amp; Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a significant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We find that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better fit to human data than Infomax (Butko &amp; Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving significant computational savings.", "id": "bcc0d400288793e8bdcd7c19a8ac0c2b", "authors": ["Sheeraz Ahmad", "He Huang", "Angela J.

A extension to a previous model (C-DAC) is proposed which myopically gathers information in order to maximize a task-specific cost function. The model is compared against an alternative that favors information without respect to cost (Infomax). The overall goal of the paper is interesting and important. The novelty of the paper is somewhat reduced simply because it reports an extension to Ahmad & Yu (2013) to deal myopically with action selection. This is fine but I wondered how novel or important that aspect of the modeling actually was (e.g., it didn't seem to figure centrally into explanations of the experiment itself). \n\nThere is some prior work on this issue. In particular, the authors might check out Markant & Gureckis, 2012 \"Does the utility of information influence sampling behavior?\" which explores a similar issue: whether people optimize information or some task-specific cost function. They found that information optimizing provided a better fit to people's behavior. \n\nThe paper was poorly written overall. The abstract was much too long, the paper exceeded the 8 page limit at NIPS, and the paper cites Ahmad & Yu, 2013 in almost every sentence including twice in the abstract alone! I had a really hard time understanding the experiment design. Terms like \"patch\" are introduced without definition (is a patch a set of trials with a particular distribution of target probabilities, or possible target locations? I couldn't really tell). Also, while the overall theoretical issue seemed well motivated, the paper itself focused on this \"confirmatory search\" phenomena which the authors seemed to ad-hoc identify in their data. Why was this phenomena selected or critical for differentiating the models? \n\nAlso, the model result for section 3 were not that compelling. The full C-DAC hits all the qualitative patterns as do the myopic one. The authors don't discuss what this means. Is it the case that the measures the authors selected here just don't tell any of the models apart very well? No fit statistics or quantification of the advantage for the more limited model is offered other than to describe is as \"more psychologically plausible.\" Section 4 was also very opaque. I didn't understand the policy-space graphs in Figure 3 and I suspect that most readers will have significant difficulty with this as well. It is unclear what \"Greedy MAP\" is as well as this model is never mentioned in the paper. \n\nThe analysis presented in Figure 4 is odd because if this is meant to be a model of humans, no mention is made of human performance. It is fine to say that the myopic C-DAC model performs well on a number of metrics, but as a model it should match human observer as well (unless this is meant as a engineering analysis of a computer vision based visual search algorithm?). \n\n*Note* My initial evaluation was a little more negative, but after discussion with the other reviewers I have given a 7. I think some of the critical comments above still apply, but there are also strengths including the emphasis on multiple model comparison, the empirical data, and the novelty of deriving theorems about the optimal stopping rule. I thought the author's response was helpful and it would be nice if the paper was edited somewhat in accordance with the reviewer questions to be more clear if it is accepted. \n A myopic modification is added to a recent model of cost-sensitive active sensing. The model is fit to data from a visual search task, and the myopic model appears to fit the data of the experiment fairly well. However, qualitatively the full (non-myopic) model performs about the same. Other aspects of the paper were somewhat difficult to understand given what was written including the graphs of policy-space functions. Overall I think there are a lot of interesting ideas here, but the paper is not quite developed yet. The contribution beyond the original C-DAC model is unclear (outside of a vauge notion of being more psychologically plausible because it doesn't optimize multiple steps ahead into the future).", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Paper 1349 \u2013 Context-sensitivity in human active sensing \n\nThis paper explores how people guide their search for information in a visual display. They describe a recently proposed model, C-DAC, present an optimal stopping result, and a computation-bounded approximation to the optimal cost. Afterwards, they present an experiment where there are three patches of stimuli (dots moving either to the left or right with some amount of coherence), and participants are supposed to report the patch with dots moving to the left as quickly as possible. Generally, the models using C-DAC generated policies that resulted in behavior a bit more like the human results, than the behavior resulting from a model using an Infomax generated policy. Finally, they conclude with simulations that can distinguish between the three policy generation methods. \n\nThe paper focuses on a critical computational problem faced by both people and machines: How should an agent allocate its sensors to the different places in the environment to best solve the task at hand? The approach taken is very interesting, elegant, and a reasonable candidate for what the visual system is aiming to solve at a computational level. However, the simulations at the end of the paper distinguishing between the different methods was very interesting, but I was left disappointed that there weren\u2019t human results as well! Furthermore, I found the evaluation of their method too poor to merit a NIPS publication, and as, C-DAC is a previously published model, and it should not be considered a contribution of the paper. \n\nHowever, there are some issues with the paper that leave me on the fence regarding whether or not I believe it should be published at NIPS. The framing of the paper is about how C-DAC provides context-sensitive policies, but I don\u2019t understand in what sense it is context-sensitive. It would help to be more upfront about what exactly the context is in this context. I don\u2019t see how the case study highlighted why being context-sensitive matters. In fact, besides Infomax getting the search times wrong for when 9 was the target, I did not find the experiment too convincing that people were guided by similar computational principles as C-DAC. Furthermore, there are few dependent variables being predicted for the complexity and number of parameters used by C-DAC. Finally, the simulations at the end of the paper seemed much more interesting than the case study and potentially could provide stronger evidence for C-DAC. However, there were no human experiments based on these simulations. The authors may be better off waiting to publish the project with the human results for these later simulations, which would result in a much stronger paper, than publishing the current paper. \n\nMinor comments: \nSection 2.1: When a vector has been indexed to a scalar, I personally like it to no longer be bold. \nSection 3.1, line 232: \u201cthe probability of a target containing a target\u201d should that be a patch containing a target? \nSection 3.2 title: \u201cModel vs. behavior\u201d the use of vs. sounded a bit strange to me.
