{"title": "Relevance Topic Model for Unstructured Social Group Activity Recognition", "abstract": "Unstructured social group activity recognition in web videos is a challenging task due to 1) the semantic gap between class labels and low-level visual features and 2) the lack of labeled training data. To tackle this problem, we propose a relevance topic model\" for jointly learning meaningful mid-level representations upon bag-of-words (BoW) video representations and a classifier with sparse weights. In our approach, sparse Bayesian learning is incorporated into an undirected topic model (i.e., Replicated Softmax) to discover topics which are relevant to video classes and suitable for prediction. Rectified linear units are utilized to increase the expressive power of topics so as to explain better video data containing complex contents and make variational inference tractable for the proposed model. An efficient variational EM algorithm is presented for model parameter estimation and inference. Experimental results on the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute dataset show that our model achieves state of the art performance and outperforms other supervised topic model in terms of classification accuracy, particularly in the case of a very small number of labeled training videos.\"", "id": "c4851e8e264415c4094e4e85b0baa7cc", "authors": ["Fang Zhao", "Yongzhen Huang", "Liang Wang", "Tieniu Tan"], "conference": "NIPS2013", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The authors build on the replicated softmax model to devise a classification approach that lends itself to the video classification with only a few examples. The model consists of two parts: The first part is similar to a replicated softmax model that captures topics in the features, with the difference of using a rectified linear units. The second part consists of a discriminant function as a linear combination of topics. The authors apply a trick to make inference tractable: they derive a variational bound which is further lower bounded exploiting the semi-conjugacy between the rectified linear units and the Gaussian likelihood. The model is evaluated on a dataset of videos of social activities, which are to be classified. \n\nThe problem is important, the model derivation is sound, the experimental evaluation is correct. \n\nHowever, the approach is independent (and not motivated) from the application of unstructured social group activity recognition. It seems to me that the author developed a general feature learning and classification approach that should be evaluated against other classification datasets and further baselines. \n\n An ok approach, but the approach has not much to do with social group activity recognition. As a generic feature learning and classification approach, many comparison to other base lines would strengthen the work.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "\uf0e8 This paper considers automatic classification of unstructured social group activity videos. To bridge the semantic gap between low-level features and the class-labels, the authors adopt a latent topic model based on replicated softmax to extract topics as mid-level representations for video classification. The main idea of this paper is the integration of sparse Bayesian learning and replicated softmax, which leads to the proposed model referred to \u201crelevance topic model (RTM)\u201d. In RTM, the discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights are learned jointly, and the authors proposes variational EM algorithm for model parameter estimation and inference. The authors test their algorithm on a benchmark dataset and demonstrate better performance compared to other supervised topic models and some baseline algorithms. \n\uf0e8 The paper seems to be well organized. It is well motivated and proposes ideas that are useful in relative area (e.g. video scene analysis, classification and recognition ). It cites relevant research papers adequately. \n\uf0e8 It is difficult to understand the significance in using sparsity on the BOW representation, classifier and hierarchical prior on the weight. Also, it is not clear what the significant differences are between the attributes used in the previous research [4] and the topics discovered by the proposed RTM. It should be noted that the idea of using Replicated softmax model for extracting latent topics as mid-level representations is not novel [5]. However, the key idea of this paper is the joint learning of latent topics and classifier weights, which is interesting and novel. \n\uf0e8 Section 3.3 contains many complex mathematical equations, which is not easy to follow. \n\uf0e8 Experimental results demonstrate good performance of proposed algorithms. However, the experimental backup is rather weak due to the following two issues; 1) The performance in terms of generalization is not good. In case of using many instances (e.g 100 in Table2), the proposed algorithm could not achieve good results. 2) In Section 4.3, the authors compare the proposed algorithm with only the baselines in [4]. Since the novelty of the proposed algorithm in relation to the previous Replicated softmax model seems to be the joint learning of discriminative topics and sparse classifier weights, the reviewer suggest using other baselines where the topics are extracted via previous replicated softmax, but classifier weights are learned separately from the topics (e.g. latent topic extraction using replicated softmax[5] + SVM classifier). \n The key idea of this paper is the joint learning of latent topics and classifier weights, which is interesting and will be useful in many related research fields (e.g. video context classification and recognition). In the experiment section, it is recommended to include additional baseline methods to compare to reveal the strength of the above key idea.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "General: \nThe paper proposes a supervised (hybrid) topic model for unstructured activity recognition. The model is named: relevance topic model (RTM). The supervised part is the label of the classes of the training videos. \n\nRTM is an integration of sparse Bayesian learning and Replicated Softmax. The main concept is to jointly learn discriminative topics as mid-level video representations and discriminant function as a video classifier. RTM is composed of an undirected part to model the marginal distribution of video \nwords and a directed part to model the conditional distribution of video classes given the latent topics. Also, the authors propose the parameter estimation and inference methods. \nThe authors evaluate their algorithm in the Unstructured Social Activity Attribute (USAA) presenting quantitative results of RTM. They compare the method with the literature improving in all cases the activity classification accuracy. Also the authors show an interesting comparison of the correlation of topics of two different classes. \n\nThe idea seems interesting. The usage of SIFT, STIP and MFCC which are very low level features mostly based on pixel representations. It can be interesting a small discussion on how more descriptive features (object detection) can be added to the model. \n\nRelevant work that could be added in the Bibliography, [1] Similar subject [2] interesting approach on structured activity discovery. \n\n[1] Social Role Discovery in Human Events \nVignesh Ramananthan, Bangpeng Yao, and Li Fei-Fei \nIEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

An interesting question would be how many is the minimal human labeled data that is required to classify wild videos decently. \n\nSignificance: \nThe topic is exciting research, I would say of big significance. \n The paper addresses an interesting topic, which is the recognition of social activities in unconstrained videos.
