{"title": "On Poisson Graphical Models", "abstract": "Undirected graphical models, such as Gaussian graphical models, Ising, and multinomial/categorical graphical models, are widely used in a variety of applications for modeling distributions over a large number of variables. These standard instances, however, are ill-suited to modeling count data, which are increasingly ubiquitous in big-data settings such as genomic sequencing data, user-ratings data, spatial incidence data, climate studies, and site visits. Existing classes of Poisson graphical models, which arise as the joint distributions that correspond to Poisson distributed node-conditional distributions, have a major drawback: they can only model negative conditional dependencies for reasons of normalizability given its infinite domain. In this paper, our objective is to modify the Poisson graphical model distribution so that it can capture a rich dependence structure between count-valued variables. We begin by discussing two strategies for truncating the Poisson distribution and show that only one of these leads to a valid joint distribution; even this model, however, has limitations on the types of variables and dependencies that may be modeled. To address this, we propose two novel variants of the Poisson distribution and their corresponding joint graphical model distributions.  These models provide a class of Poisson graphical models that can capture both positive and negative conditional dependencies between count-valued variables. One can learn the graph structure of our model via penalized neighborhood selection, and we demonstrate the performance of our methods by learning simulated networks as well as a network from microRNA-Sequencing data.", "id": "43feaeeecd7b2fe2ae2e26d917b6477d", "authors": ["Eunho Yang", "Pradeep K.

The authors argue that the \"default\" model that arises from Yang et al. is not satisfactory because it can only model negative correlations in order for the distribution to be normalized. They then consider a series of fixes for this including a new truncation method, using a quadratic base measure statistic (which they prove is necessary with everything else fixed), and finally a sub-linear sufficient statistic. The authors present experimental results on both synthetic and real data. \n\nThis is a well written paper describing some nice solutions for representing count data. I believe this is original, and the results are significant. \n\nI found the \"big negatives\" of the truncation and quadratic models to be somewhat unconvincing. For the truncation, I could imagine that there would be a lot of interesting domains for which counts typically don't get too high and the model would work well. For the quadratic model, couldn't \"Gaussian-esque thin tails\" be appropriate sometimes? \n\nI don't know what \"sparsistent\" means, but I see that this term has been used for a while. \n\nPage 3, above 2.1.1: \"graphical mode distributions\" => \"model\" \nPage 5, above 3.1: \"Note that the log...\" Do you mean \"Note that although the log\"?

Starting with a proof that previously suggested truncation \ndoes not lead to a valid model, the authors suggest several alternatives. \nThe TPGM truncation, though obvious, is warranted due to its natural \ninterpretation. The QPGM and SPGM, while technically simple, are \nnovel in that the base measure and sufficient statistics of the \nexponential representation are put pm the table as the means to \nmodify the Poisson distribution. Further, the changes made are \nwell motivated and appealing. That said, the actual theory involved \nfollows almost directly from the work of Yang et al so that we are \nleft with several possible model suggestions whose merit need to be \nevaluated in practice. \n\nIn light of the above, the experimental evaluation is disappointing, \nparticularly since the declared goal of the paper is to fix the practical \nlimitations of Poisson graphical models. While the synthetic experiment \nshows some potential, the data is geared toward the models suggested. \nIn the real experiments, the comparison to copula-based alternatives is \nglaringly missing. Further, the reported results are only qualitatively anecdotal. \nSince all method involve the construction of joint distributions, a more \nobjective log-probability of test data evaluation is needed. \n\nMore important, and indeed this touches on the core issue of whether \nthere is a need for the new model, is the fact that the copula competitors \nare used in an overly black-box manner. In particular, even when using \nonly a Gaussian copula, it makes more sense to use some sensible marginal \nmodel rather than the one used in the non-paranormal (and that has no density!) \nwhich was mainly chosen due to its asymptotic properties rather than \npractical merits. The essentially identical performance to Glasso is suspicious \nand I strongly suspect that even simple Gaussian kernel density \nestimates would do much better. Similarly, if applied to the real-data, \nthe (sensible) choice of using R=11 can also be translated to a \nchoice for the marginal of the copula. I do not expect in-depth exploration \nhere but some reasonable baseline is warranted. \n\nFinally, the paper is generally well written. Though I believe all results \nare true, particularly since the authors start with an error in another \nwork, I suggest including all proofs in the supplementary material. \nAlso, I felt that the end of section 3.1 was overly detailed and that \nthe bound did not contribute to the Gaussian-esque argument. \nOn the other hand, I would take 3.2 more slowly as it is the heart \nof the suggested method and in particular not defer the figure to the \nsupplementary material but rather present it and better explain its intuition. \n Based on a conditional exponential construction,the authors present alternatives to thePoisson graphical model with the goal of allowing forflexible joint modeling with a mix of positive andnegative dependencies.On the good side, the approach suggested is appealingand has some theoretical novelty. On the bad side, theexperimental evaluation is limited and somewhat biasedso that the bottom line is yet another multivariate Poisson-likemodel whose merit is unclear.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper provides a construction for multivariate distributions over \nunbounded counts that obey the Markov structure of an undirected \nnetwork. \n\nBuilding a multivariate distribution over unbounded counts is in \ngeneral a hard problem, as studied at length by Besag and others for \nthe past 30 years (including textbooks such as Arnold et al.'s \n\"Conditional Specification of Statistical Models\", 1999, which extends \nsome of the observations of the authors to other distributions such as \nconditionally-specified exponential distributions). \n\nIn the end, the proposal given by the authors succeeds in some \nrelevant ways. The upsides are constructions that do allow for \nmarginal distributions over counts and which lead to relatively simple \nestimation algorithms. The downsides are, QPGM has marginally thinner \ntails and SPGM does not have closed-form conditional distributions \n(which somehow defeats the point of building a conditionally specified \nmodel). As a matter of fact, I don't even know how SPGM can be called \na Poisson distribution (for QPGM at least one can claim that ``only'' \nthe base measure is being changed). That's OK, but it made me wonder \nwhat the main motivation for modeling counts is, since the Poisson \nitself is not a good distribution to fit empirical data anyway (don't \nget me wrong, the Poisson is a very useful as a building block to many \nmodels - components of stochastic processes and within latent variable \nmodels etc. - but could you plot your data for breast cancer and tell \nme whether it looks anything close to a Poisson?). It would be very \nuseful to have a plot of the probability mass function of the SPGM \ntoo, which feels somewhat convoluted at first sight. I suppose you are \nconsidering R and R0 as constants (or otherwise these wouldn't be \nexponential families). How are they chosen? Which advice do you give \nto the practitioner? \n\nThat being said: to construct a multivariate distribution over counts \nobeying the independence model of MRF is hard. I honestly appreciate \nthe effort put in this paper and I think the results are of \ntheoretical interest to NIPS. The only thing that rubs me in the wrong \nway is the somewhat overly light appreciation of the literature. For \ninstance, it almost feels like the authors don't really know what a \ncopula is. The authors seem not to understand [8] (or at least \ndefinitely presented it in the wrong way), for instance, where the \nwhole point is to build multivariate distributions for arbitrary \ndiscrete data (count data, inclusive), and for which a battery of MCMC \nand approximate inference methods exist. It made me wonder whether the \ndiscussion of [11] truly makes any sense, since the whole point of \nthat pioneering book is to show how to build discrete models with \nlog-linear parameters in a way it doesn't grow exponentially with the \nnumber of variables (although fair enough I don't have a copy of it \nwith me right now and I don't remember anymore what it says about \nPoisson distributions). But perhaps the worst omission is a complete \nneglect of the vast spatial statistics literature, where \nhigh-dimensional count data analysis has been done for a long time. \n\nIt needs to be said that several of these approaches (including the \nsparse precision Gaussian copula model of [8]) don't really model \nMRF-style independence constraints in the observable space. So as I \nsaid the theoretical contribution of this paper is a valid one. But as \na practitioner I'm not yet convinced why I should pay the price of \nsticking to this model space instead of just using the simpler \nstructured Gaussian random field + Poisson measurement model, which \nhas been the standard for a long time. \n\nFinal comment: I'm not an expert in gene expression analysis at all, \nbut I would be grateful to have a reference newer than [20] claiming \nthat ``counts of sequencing reads ... are replacing microarrays''. \n A method for constructing multivariate distributions for counts that is Markov with respect to undirected graphs.
