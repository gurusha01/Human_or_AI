{"title": "Firing rate predictions in optimal balanced networks", "abstract": "How are firing rates in a spiking network related to neural input, connectivity and network function? This is an important problem because firing rates are one of the most important measures of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difficult problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculating firing rates in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate firing rates by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimizing signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate firing rates by finding the solution to the algorithm. Our firing rate calculation relates network firing rates directly to network input, connectivity and function. This allows us to explain the function and underlying mechanism of tuning curves in a variety of systems.", "id": "f2201f5191c4e92cc5af043eebfd0946", "authors": ["David G.

A major difficulty in relating the two is multi-leveled complexity of neural systems in terms on nonlinearity, variability and stochasticity. The present is concerned with networks of spiking neurons which attempt to optimally represent time-varying input signals. The performance cost function comprises a quadratic error function and a penalty for high activity. The authors show how the natural network dynamics of a network of spiking neurons can be described as minimizing this cost function, leading to a so-called balanced state, which is, arguably, widely regarded as a natural state for biological neuron dynamics. An important attribute of the present formulation is that it does not rely on linear approximations, as has often been used in the past, leading to a more faithful representation of the true dynamics. Within this framework the authors compute the firing rates as the solution of a quadratic problem subject to non-negativity constraints on the rates, allowing them to express the solution in closed form as piece-wise linear function. They also relate the types of tuning curves obtained (monotonic or bell-shaped) to the nature of the input, and show that optimal performance can be achieved using heterogeneous tuning curves, as has been, indeed, observed in biological systems. \nOverall I found this paper interesting and insightful, and, in combination with ref. [13] that deals with synaptic plasticity, constitute an original contribution to the structure-function relationship. \nSpecific comments: \n1) The form of E in (6) suggests that W must be symmetric (since the anti-symmetric component of W does not contribute to the quadratic term). However, eq. (7) itself does not seem to require symmetry. Please relate to this issue. \n2) Equation (6) suggests that it must have a minimum at which dE/d\\nu=0 so that \\dot V = 0. However, why does this entail V_i=0 (balanced state) rather than V_i=constant. \n3) Typo: Line 330, where $\\beta I$ - something is missing. \n An interesting paper motivating the balanced state in spiking neural networks as a solution to an optimal representation problem.

While rather technical, the paper is well written, the approach is new, interesting and seems to be sound. The results are convincing, except maybe that the spiking (as shown in Fig. 1) does not appear as stochastic as in cortex. Taken together the approach has a huge potential to foster our understanding of the operation state and the function of cortical networks involved in sensory processing.

The paper is well written aside from a few points (described below) that need clarification. \n\nUnfortunately, however, this paper represents only a relatively small conceptual advance over Ref. 13 (Bourdoukan et al., NIPS 2012) as well as the paper under revision submitted as a supplement. Specifically, the entire section 2 here was already described by Bourdoukan et al NIPS 2012. The fact that an inhomogeneous network can represent signals with a performance similar to those exhibited by homogeneous systems was made by Bourdoukan et al as well as in a number of other recent neuroscience publications. This leaves only the calculation of the firing rates as a new contribution. Nevertheless, this too was essentially done by Bourdoukan et al 2012 NIPS (including the condition for spiking V_i > T_i). \n\nOne aspect that this paper also needs to be address is that the proposed balanced networks have a very specific structure \u2013 the number of inputs equals the number of neurons in the recurrent network. Therefore, it is not clear how one may consider divergence and convergence that often are hallmark features of neural circuits. \n\nMinor comments that need to be clarified: \n\n-- Eq. 3, I think the lower integration limit has to be 0 ( the upper integration limit may extend to infinity) \n\n-- Figure 1 legend, \u201cA spike is produced whenever the total input exceeds the spiking threshold (thin black line, bottom panel). However the number of spikes does not match the number of red dots in the upper panels that are also described as marking spike times from this neuron. \n\n-- Line 187 \u201cWe find that these curves are highly nonlinear\u201d \u2013The curves in Figure 1c look quite linear. \n This paper is nicely written and is quite interesting when read as a stand alone contribution. However, the conceptual advance relatively to Ref. 13 is questionable.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
