{"title": "A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data", "abstract": "Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials.  However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons.  We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction.  We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons.   The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena.  Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data.", "id": "d93ed5b6db83be78efb0d05ae420158e", "authors": ["Jasper Snoek", "Richard Zemel", "Ryan P.

The authors present a maximum likelihood approach based on stochastic gradient descent. This is an interesting idea that could potentially be a powerful non-factorial spike train model. \n\nHowever, the presentation here seems a bit unfocused, and it\u2019s not obvious to what extent DPPs will actually improve model accuracy. Since gain and periodic terms can easily be built into GLMs, it wasn\u2019t obvious to me that framing the problem as a DPP was worth the trouble. Rather than looking at structure in the latent space, it seems more valuable to compare the utility of the DPP approach to other approaches. \n\nGLMs with coupling between neurons, although not instantaneous, do capture correlations fairly well, and state-space models do even better with instantaneous correlations (cf Macke et al NIPS 2011). Several groups have also recently built models of instantaneous interactions using pseudo-likelihood approaches (Stevenson et al 2012 and Hanslinger et al Neural Comp 2013). How do these models, which might be considered more tractable, compare to the DPP approach? \n\nMinor issues: \nWhat kernel k_\\theta was actually used? How important is it to use a kernel built on marginal preferences (as in Eq 2)? \n\nIt\u2019s unclear to me from eq 6 how the gain control works here. In Carandini and Heeger\u2019s framing normalization is a nonlinear operation on the rate of each neuron. Here \\nu_t appears to be just a positive, stimulus-dependent scalar that affects the entire population. Is that right? \n\nIn section 2.1, the history isn\u2019t quite accurate. GLMs were actually proposed to model spike trains much earlier (Brillinger 1988 and Chornoboy et al. 1988), and Harris et al. 2003 (rather than Truccolo et al.) was one of the first to really apply it to data. \n\nIn response to the rebuttal: the additional model comparison results are helpful. I'm a bit surprised that the DPP does so much better. It still may be useful to look into the GLM-like models that can be used to describe instantaneous coupling mentioned above.

The authors show that the model can be fit to both simulated and real neural data. \n\nA missing component of this paper is to show that it is an advance over existing methods, such as GLMs. In Section 4, the authors should compare the performance of the DPP and GLM on the same data, and show that DPP can outperform the GLM. \n\nThe authors state that one of the key benefits of DPP over GLM is that DPP can capture inhibitory interaction between neurons. Can't the GLM also capture inhibitory interactions via the coupling filters? If so, why is the way in which DPP captures inhibitory interactions superior? It would be helpful to provide 1-2 sentences of intuition about how equation (1) captures inhibitory interactions. Also, the authors emphasize the use of DPP for capturing inhibitory interactions - can't the DPP also capture excitatory interactions? \n\nI had a hard time understanding Figures 2b, 3, and 4. It would be helpful if the authors would state what the reader is supposed to see. Is it possible to relate Figures 3 and 4 to the known identification of which neurons are excitatory vs. inhibitory? \n\nOn page 8, the authors state, \"The model is able to accurately capture...dichotomy of neurons\". I'm having trouble finding where in Section 4 this was shown. \n\nIn Section 3.2, it would be helpful to describe how to determine the dimensionality of y, and how to learn the kernel parameters (if present).

In addition to stimulus dependence, the \nresulting model captures pairwise competitive interactions of neurons. The \nauthors apply the model to artificial data and hippocampal recordings. \n\n\nComments: \n--------- \n\n1) The application of DPPs to neural recordings is novel to best of my \nknowledge. The incorporation of instantaneous interactions into GLMs for \nneurons (even coupled ones) such that the resulting model remains tractable is \nan important open problem. Hence, I think the paper is timely and of interest \nto the NIPS neuroscience audience. \n\n2) The paper is clearly written and DPPs are introduced quite gently, resulting \nin a very readable paper (exceptions below). \n\n3) My main criticism is that the authors did not fully convince me that their \nmodel is actually an appropriate one for multi-cell recordings. As far as I \nknow, most noise correlations that have been experimentally measured seem to be \npositive (at least in cortex) and could therefore not be captured by this DPP \napproach; please correct me if I'm wrong here. In any case, the authors \nshould have argued more thoroughly and given appropriate citations that the \nscenario of exclusively competitive interactions is an important one in \nmulti-cell recordings. \n\n4) Section 4.3, application to Hippocampus data: Unfortunately, this paragraph \ndoes not fully convince me that the DPP based model is a good model for the \ndata. Are the noise correlations (computed from the data) between pairs of \nexcitatory / pairs of inhibitory neurons / pairs of exc-inhi really mostly \nnegative (emphasize here is on noise correlations as GLMs can capture stimulus \ninduced correlations)? The authors should describe the main result figures \nFIG4 and FIG3(a) in greater detail: why is this latent embedding sensible / what \ndoes this kernel matrix tell us about the data? (The additional space required \ncould be obtained by scaling back the experiments on artificial data.) \nThe fact that the method uncovers the theta oscillations is not very surprising \n(as this is just the GLM part of the model) and could be described more \nbriefly. Table 1: The authors could have made a stronger point for the model if \nthe table included more pairs of models of the type \n\"GLM_component_1+...+GLM_component_n\" and \n\"GLM_component_1+...+GLM_component_n+Latent\", as this allows for a direct \ncomparison to figure out if adding the DPP part helps. \n\n5) Section 3.3: In the model, the stimulus dependence of each neuron is already \ncaptured by the weight vector $w_n$. Isn't the introduction of the of $w_\\nu$ \nredundant? \n\n6) The manuscript is missing a more in depth comparison between coupled GLMs \nand the DPP approach, eg: coupled GLMs are lacking an instantaneous coupling \nbetween the neurons, but this could be compensated for by binning the data on \nfiner time scales etc. \n\n\nMinor Comments: \n--------------- \n\n1) Either I don't fully understand the notation around eqn. 4 and 5 or it is is \nrather sloppy: I guess $\\Pi^{(t)}$ should be defined as \n$diag(\\sqrt{\\lambda_1^{(t)}},\\ldots)$, instead of the definition given in l157. \nFurthermore in eqn 5, $K^{(t)}_{S_t}$ probably only contains the term $k_\\theta$ \nand not the GLM part $\\lambda_n^{(t)}$, in contrast to eqn 4. If this is \ncorrect, then $K^{(t)}_{S_t}$ should be $K_{S_t}$ as the only time dependence \nwould be via ${S_t}$. Furthermore, shouldn't the normalizer in eqn 5 be \nindependent of $S_t$, i.e. contain eg $K_{\\mathcal S}$ instead of $K_{S_t}$ \n(similar for $\\Pi_{S_t}$)? \n\n2) In the definition of $K_S$ in l131, it might be worthwhile to again emphasize \nthat $n,n' \\in S$. An interesting and timely paper that would benefit from extendedbiological motivation for the proposed model and more detailed experiments.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
