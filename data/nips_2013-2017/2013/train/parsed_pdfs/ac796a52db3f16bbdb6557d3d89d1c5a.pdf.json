      "text" : "Most organisms employ a mutlitude of sensory systems to create an internal representation of their environment. While the advantages of functionally specialized neural circuits are numerous, many benefits can also be obtained by integrating sensory modalities [1, 2, 3]. The perceptual advantages of combining multiple sensory streams that provide distinct measurements of the same physical event are compelling, as each sensory modality can inform the other in environmentally unfavorable circumstances [4]. For example, combining visual and auditory stimuli corresponding to a person talking at a cocktail party can substantially enhance the accuracy of the auditory percept [5].\nInterestingly, recent studies demonstrated that multisensory integration takes place in brain areas that were traditionally considered to be unisensory [2, 6, 7]. This is in contrast to classical brain models in which multisensory integration is relegated to anatomically established sensory convergence regions, after extensive unisensory processing has already taken place [4]. Moreover, multisensory effects were shown to arise not solely due to feedback from higher cortical areas. Rather, they seem to be carried by feedforward pathways at the early stages of the processing hierarchy [2, 7, 8].\nThe computational principles of multisensory integration are still poorly understood. In part, this is because most of the experimental data comes from psychophysical and functional imaging experiments which do not provide the resolution necessary to study sensory integration at the cellular level [2, 7, 9, 10, 11]. Moreover, although multisensory neuron responses depend on several concurrently received stimuli, existing identification methods typically require separate experimental trials for each of the sensory modalities involved [4, 12, 13, 14]. Doing so creates major challenges, especially when unisensory responses are weak or together do not account for the multisensory response.\nHere we present a biophysically-grounded spiking neural circuit and a tractable mathematical methodology that together allow one to study the problems of multisensory encoding, decoding, and identification within a unified theoretical framework. Our neural circuit is comprised of a bank ∗The authors’ names are listed in alphabetical order.\nof multisensory receptive fields in cascade with a population of neurons that implement stimulus multiplexing in the spike domain. The circuit architecture is quite flexible in that it can incorporate complex connectivity [15] and a number different spike generation models [16], [17].\nOur approach is grounded in the theory of sampling in Hilbert spaces. Using this theory, we show that signals of different modalities, having different dimensions and dynamics, can be faithfully encoded into a single multidimensional spike train by a common population of neurons. Some benefits of using a common population include (a) built-in redundancy, whereby, by rerouting, a circuit could take over the function of another faulty circuit (e.g., after a stroke) (b) capability to dynamically allocate resources for the encoding of a given signal of interest (e.g., during attention) (c) joint processing and storage of multisensory signals/stimuli (e.g., in associative memory tasks).\nFirst we show that, under appropriate conditions, each of the stimuli processed by a multisensory circuit can be decoded loss-free from a common, unlabeled set of spikes. These conditions provide clear lower bounds on the size of the population of multisensory neurons and the total number of spikes generated by the entire circuit. We then discuss the open problem of identifying multisensory processing using concurrently presented sensory stimuli. We show that the identification of multisensory processing in a single neuron is elegantly related to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons. Moreover, we prove that only a projection of the circuit onto the space of input stimuli can be identified. Finally, we present examples of both decoding and identification algorithms and demonstrate their performance using natural stimuli."

      "text" : "Our formal model of multisensory encoding, called the multisensory Time Encoding Machine (mTEM) is closely related to traditional TEMs [18]. TEMs are real-time asynchronous mechanisms for encoding continuous and discrete signals into a time sequence. They arise as models of early sensory systems in neuroscience [17, 19] as well as nonlinear sampling circuits and analogto-discrete (A/D) converters in communication systems [17, 18]. However, in contrast to traditional TEMs that encode one or more stimuli of the same dimension n, a general mTEM receives M input stimuli u1n1 , ..., u M nM of different dimensions nm∈N, m=1, ...,M , and possibly different dynamics (Fig. 1a). The mTEM processes and encodes these signals into a multidimensional spike train using a population ofN neurons. For each neuron i=1, ..., N , the results of this processing are aggregated into the dendritic current vi flowing into the spike initiation zone, where it is encoded into a time sequence (tik)k∈Z, with t i k denoting the timing of the k th spike of neuron i.\nSimilarly to traditional TEMs, mTEMs can employ a myriad of spiking neuron models. Several examples include conductance-based models such as Hodgkin-Huxley, Morris-Lecar, FitzhughNagumo, Wang-Buzsaki, Hindmarsh-Rose [20] as well as simpler models such as the ideal and leaky integrate-and-fire (IAF) neurons [15]. For clarity, we will limit our discussion to the ideal IAF neuron, since other models can be handled as described previously [20, 21]. For an ideal IAF neuron with a bias bi ∈ R+, capacitance Ci ∈ R+ and threshold δi ∈ R+ (Fig. 1b), the mapping of the current vi into spikes is described by a set of equations formerly known as the t-transform [18]:\n∫ tik+1 tik vi(s)ds = qik, k ∈ Z, (1)\nwhere qik = C iδi − bi(tik+1 − tik). Intuitively, at every spike time tik+1, the ideal IAF neuron is providing a measurement qik of the current v i(t) on the time interval [tik, t i k+1)."

      "text" : "We model input signals as elements of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) [22]. Most real world signals, including natural stimuli can be described by an appropriately chosen RKHS [23]. For practical and computational reasons we choose to work with the space of trigonometric polynomials Hnm defined below, where each element of the space is a function in nm variables (nm ∈ N, m = 1, 2, ...,M ). However, we note that the results obtained in this paper are not limited to this particular choice of RKHS (see, e.g., [24]). Definition 1.

In what follows, we will primarily be concerned with time-varying stimuli, and the dimension xnm will denote the temporal dimension t of the stimulus u m nm , i.e., xnm = t. Remark 2. For M concurrently received stimuli, we have Tn1 = Tn2 = · · · = TnM . Example 1. We model audio stimuli um1 = um1 (t) as elements of the RKHS H1 over the domain D1 = [0, T1]. For notational convenience, we drop the dimensionality subscript and use T , Ω and L, to denote the period, bandwidth and order of the spaceH1. An audio signal um1 ∈ H1 can be written as um1 (t) = ∑L l=−L u m l el(t), where the coefficients u m l ∈ C and el(t) = exp (jlΩt/L) / √ T . Example 2. We model video stimuli um3 = um3 (x, y, t) as elements of the RKHS H3 defined on D3 = [0, T1] × [0, T2] × [0, T3], where T1 = 2πL1/Ω1, T2 = 2πL2/Ω2, T3 = 2πL3/Ω3, with (Ω1, L1), (Ω2, L2) and (Ω3, L3) denoting the (bandwidth, order) pairs in spatial directions x, y and in time t, respectively.

Repeating for all neurons i = 1, ..., N , we obtain q = Φu with Φ = [Φ1; Φ2; ... ; ΦN ] and q = [q1; q2; ... ; qN ]. This system of linear equations can be solved for u, provided that the rank r(Φ) of matrix Φ satisfies r(Φ) = ∑ m ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1). A necessary condition for the latter is that the total number of measurements generated by all N neurons is greater or equal to ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1). Equivalently, the total number of spikes produced by all N\nneurons should be greater than ∏nm\nn=1(2Ln + 1) + N . Then u can be uniquely specified as the solution to a convex optimization problem, e.g., u = Φ+q. To find the sufficient condition, we note\nthat the mth component vim of the dendritic current vi has a maximal bandwidth of Ωnm and we need only 2Lnm + 1 measurements to specify it. Thus each neuron can produce a maximum of only 2PLnm + 1 informative measurements, or equivalently, 2PLnm + 2 informative spikes on a time interval [0, Tnm ]. It follows that for each modality, we require at least ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1)/(2Lnm + 1)\nneurons if ν ≥ (2Lnm + 2) and at least d ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1)/(ν − 1)e neurons if ν < (2Lnm + 2)."

We will show that this problem is mathematically dual to the decoding problem discussed above. Specifically, we will demonstrate that the identification problem can be converted into a neural encoding problem, where each spike train (tik)k∈Z produced during an experimental trial i, i = 1, ..., N , is interpreted to be generated by the ith neuron in a population of N neurons. We consider identifying kernels for only one multisensory neuron (identification for multiple neurons can be performed in a serial fashion) and drop the superscript i in himnm throughout this section. Instead, we introduce the natural notion of performing multiple experimental trials and use the same superscript i to index stimuli uimnm on different trials i = 1, ..., N .\nConsider the multisensory neuron depicted in Fig. 1. Since for every trial i, an input signal uimnm , m = 1, ...,M , can be modeled as an element of some space Hnm , we have uimnm(x1, ..., xnm) = 〈uimnm(·, ..., ·),Knm(·, ..., ·;x1, ..., xnm)〉 by the reproducing property of the RK Knm.

The t-transform of the mTEM in Fig. 1 can then be written as\nLi1k [Ph1n1 ] + Li2k [Ph2n2 ] + ...+ LiMk [PhMnM ] = qik, (7)\nwhere Limk : Hnm → R, m = 1, ...,M , k ∈ Z, are linear functionals defined by\nLimk [Phmnm ] = ∫ tik+1 tik [∫ Dm uimnm(s1, ... , snm)(Phmnm)(s1, ..., t− snm)ds1 ... dsnm ] dt.\nRemark 3. Intuitively, each inter-spike interval [tik, tik+1) produced by the IAF neuron is a time measurement qik of the (weighted) sum of all kernel projections Phmnm , m = 1, ...,M . Remark 4. Each projection Phmnm is determined by the corresponding stimuli uimnm , i = 1, ..., N , employed during identification and can be substantially different from the underlying kernel hmnm .\nIt follows that we should be able to identify the projections Phmnm , m=1, ...,M , from the measurements (qik)k∈Z. Since we are free to choose any of the spacesHnm , an arbitrarily-close identification of original kernels is possible, provided that the bandwidth of the test signals is sufficiently large. Theorem 2. (Multisensory Channel Identification Machine (mCIM)) Let {ui}Ni=1, ui =[ui1n1 , ..., uiMnM ]T , uimnm∈Hnm , m=1, ...,M , be a collection ofN linearly independent stimuli at the input to an mTEM circuit comprised of receptive fields with kernels hmnm ∈Hnm , m = 1, ...,M , in cascade with an ideal IAF neuron. Given the coefficients uiml1,...,lnm of stimuli uimnm , i= 1, ..., N , m= 1, ...,M , the kernel projections Phmnm , m= 1, ...,M , can be perfectly identified as (Phmnm)(x1, ..., xnm) = ∑L1 l1=−L1 ... ∑Lnm lnm=−Lnm h m l1...lnm\nel1...lnm (x1, ..., xnm), where hml1...lnm are elements of h = Φ\n+q, and Φ+ denotes the pseudoinverse of Φ. Furthermore, Φ=[Φ1; Φ2; ... ; ΦN ], q=[q1; q2; ... ; qN ] and [qi]k =qik. Each matrix Φ\ni =[Φi1,Φi2, ...,Φim], with\n[Φim]kl =    uim−l1,−l2,...,−lnm−1,lnm (t i k+1 − tik), lnm = 0 uim−l1,−l2,...,−lnm−1,lnmLnm √ Tnm ( elnm (t i k+1)− elnm (tik) )\njlnmΩnm , lnm 6= 0\n, (8)\nwhere l traverses all subscript combinations of l1, l2, ..., lnm . A necessary condition for identification is that the total number of spikes generated in response to all N trials is larger than∑M\nm=1 ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1) + N . If the neuron produces ν spikes on each trial, a sufficient condi-\ntion is that the number of trials N ≥ ⌈∑M\nm=1 ∏nm n=1(2Ln + 1)/min(ν − 1, 2Lnm + 1) ⌉ .\nProof: The equivalent representation of the t-transform in equations (4) and (7) implies that the decoding of the stimulus umnm (in Theorem 1) and the identification of the filter projections Phmnm encountered here are dual problems. Therefore, the receptive field identification problem is equivalent to a neural encoding problem: the projectionsPhmnm ,m = 1, ...,M , are encoded with an mTEM comprised of N neurons and receptive fields uimnm , i = 1, ..., N , m = 1, ...,M . The algorithm for finding the coefficients hml1...lnm is analogous to the one for u m l1...lnm in Theorem 1."

Each temporal and spatiotemporal filter could be realized in a number of ways, e.g., using gammatone and Gabor filter banks. For simplicity, we assume that the number of temporal and spatiotemporal filters in Fig. 2 is the same. In practice, the number of components could be different and would be determined by the bandwidth of input stimuli Ω, or equivalently the order L, and the number of spikes produced (Theorems 1-2).\nFor each neuron i, i = 1, ..., N , the filter outputs vi1 and vi2, are summed to form the aggregate dendritic current vi, which is encoded into a sequence of spike times (tik)k∈Z by the i\nth integrateand-fire neuron. Thus each spike train (tik)k∈Z carries information about two stimuli of completely different modalities (audio and video) and, under certain conditions, the entire collection of spike trains {tik}Ni=1, k ∈ Z, can provide a faithful representation of both signals. To demonstrate the performance of the algorithm presented in Theorem 1, we simulated a multisensory TEM with each neuron having a non-separable spatiotemporal receptive field for video stimuli and a temporal receptive field for audio stimuli. Spatiotemporal receptive fields were chosen randomly and had a bandwidth of 4 Hz in temporal direction t and 2 Hz in each spatial direction x and y. Similarly, temporal receptive fields were chosen randomly from functions bandlimited to 4 kHz. Thus, two distinct stimuli having different dimensions (three for video, one for audio) and dynamics (2-4 cycles vs. 4, 000 cycles in each direction) were multiplexed at the level of every spiking neuron and encoded into an unlabeled set of spikes. The mTEM produced a total of 360, 000 spikes in response to a 6-second-long grayscale video and mono audio of Albert Einstein explaining the mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2: “... [a] very small amount of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy.” A multisensory TDM was then used to reconstruct the video and audio stimuli from the produced set of spikes. Fig. 4a-b shows the original (top row) and recovered (middle row) video and audio, respectively, together with the error between them (bottom row).\nThe neural encoding interpretation of the identification problem for the grayscale video/mono audio TEM is shown in Fig. 3a. The block diagram of the corresponding mCIM appears in Fig. 3b. Comparing this diagram to the one in Fig. 2, we note that neuron blocks have been replaced by trial blocks. Furthermore, the stimuli now appear as kernels describing the filters and the inputs to the circuit are kernel projections Phmnm , m = 1, ...,M . In other words, identification of a single neuron has been converted into a population encoding problem, where the artificially constructed population of N neurons is associated with the N spike trains generated in response to N experimental trials.\nThe performance of the mCIM algorithm is visualized in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a-b shows the original (top row) and recovered (middle row) spatio-temporal and temporal receptive fields, respectively, together with the error between them (bottom row)."

Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive fields in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identification of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identified. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identification algorithms.",
