{"title": "No-Regret Learning in Bayesian Games", "abstract": "Recent price-of-anarchy analyses of games of complete information suggest that coarse correlated equilibria, which characterize outcomes resulting from no-regret learning dynamics, have near-optimal welfare. This work provides two main technical results that lift this conclusion to games of incomplete information, a.k.a., Bayesian games. First, near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public.  Second, no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games. These results are enabled by interpretation of a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information.", "id": "3e7e0224018ab3cf51abb96464d518cd", "authors": ["Jason Hartline", "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "Eva Tardos"], "conference": "NIPS2015", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "This paper attempts to show that the price of anarchy bounds already achieved via the smoothness property of games extends to results on the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games. To achieve that, the authors interpreted a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information where there are a large population of possible participants. Once this assumption done, two important results are shown: First the outcome converges to a form of Bayesian corase correlated equilibrium when all players use a form of no-regret learning in the considered stochastic game. Second, the considedred stochatic game is also smooth if the game or the mechanism is itself smooth. These two reslts show that the price of anarchy results obtained via the smoothness technique extend to outcomes of no-regret learning in Bayesian games. This paper is very hard to read and to evaluate; it is more convenient for the \"Game Theory\" community than for the \"NIPS\" one (as its references reflect). Futhermore, it seems not be written specifically for the NIPS conference, it is just a \"cut and past\" from a extended version. This is reflected by the last section where the authors are saying: \"In this section, we analyze the convergence...\" and nothing is specified about this convergence. Some questions, remarks and suggestions: (a) why the extra material just gives proofs of Th 10 and 13? How about other Ths/Lemmas? (b) why the correlated equilibrium is this one of Forges? (c) the Th 11 is not clear, do you mean it converges to BCCE? please elaborate more on that. (d) Selfish players are hard to manage, except when we add a central entity as is the case via the correlated EQ. With this sort of equilibrium, the problem is more easy to solve (in general) but does this reflect a realistic approach?\n\n  The main result of this paper is to show that the price of anarchy bounds achieved via the smoothness property of games or mechanisms extends to results on the quality of learning outcomes in Bayesian games.

The price of anarchy is the ratio of the optimal social welfare over the worst social welfare achievable under certain type of equilibrium. The literature on this subject is quite extensive and bounds on the price of anarchy have been shown for the large class of coarse correlated equilibria. In the world of games of incomplete information, however, these results do not exist and only bounds on the price of anarchy of Bayes-Nash equilibria exist.\n\n The main contribution of this paper is to provide a bound on the price of anarchy for coarse correlated equilibria. The way this is done is by reducing these game to several full information games.\n\nThe paper is really hard to read and seems to lack generality. Even the setup was not completely clear to me. What do the authors mean by\n\n\"F_i be the empirical distributions of values in population P_i\" which samples are being used to talk about the empirical distribution?\n\n I think that the main issue of the paper comes from Lemma 10. The hypothesis of the lemma are not completely clear to me. First of all, they say that D^T is an empirical distribution of plays and they say if a subsequence of D^T converges in distribution to D then ... However, D^T is a random measure so is the convergence in distribution a.s? Must the subsequence be the same for all values of D^T? This same type of questions arise on equation (10) after taking the limit. In a way they are taking the limit of the form\n\nE_{s \\sim D^T}[f_T(s)]\n\n and they claim that because f_T \\right arrow f a.s. and D^T \\rightarrow D in distribution (which again does not make much sense), then the above term will converge to E_{s \\sim D} [f(s)]. It is not entirely clear to me that this will hold in general and if it does then the authors should provide a better explanation.\n\nThe rest of the paper seems to be correct so if the authors can address my comments on Lemma 10 I would consider accepting the paper. Nevertheless, I don't believe that the subject of the paper would be of much interest to the NIPS community.\n\n OK paper that extends the price of anarchy results of full information games to Bayesian games.The paper is really hard to read and I suspect that one of the proofs is wrong.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
