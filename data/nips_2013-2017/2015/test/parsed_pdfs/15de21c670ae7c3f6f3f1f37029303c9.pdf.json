      "text" : "In undirected graphical models, maximum likelihood learning is intractable in general. For example, Jerrum and Sinclair [1993] show that evaluation of the partition function (which can easily be computed from the likelihood) for an Ising model is #P-complete, and that even the existence of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for the partition function would imply that RP = NP.\nIf the model is well-specified (meaning that the target distribution falls in the assumed family) then there exist several methods that can efficiently recover correct parameters, among them the pseudolikelihood [3], score matching [16, 22], composite likelihoods [20, 30], Mizrahi et al.’s [2014] method based on parallel learning in local clusters of nodes and Abbeel et al.’s [2006] method based on matching local probabilities. While often useful, these methods have some drawbacks. First, these methods typically have inferior sample complexity to the likelihood. Second, these all assume a well-specified model. If the target distribution is not in the assumed class, the maximum-likelihood solution will converge to the M-projection (minimum of the KL-divergence), but these estimators do not have similar guarantees. Third, even when these methods succeed, they typically yield a distribution in which inference is still intractable, and so it may be infeasible to actually make use of the learned distribution.\nGiven these issues, a natural approach is to restrict the graphical model parameters to a tractable set Θ, in which learning and inference can be performed efficiently. The gradient of the likelihood is determined by the marginal distributions, whose difficulty is typically determined by the treewidth of the graph. Thus, probably the most natural tractable family is the set of tree-structured distributions,\nwhere Θ = {θ : ∃tree T, ∀(i, j) ̸∈ T, θij = 0}. The Chow-Liu algorithm [1968] provides an efficient method for finding the maximum likelihood parameter vector θ in this set, by computing the mutual information of all empirical pairwise marginals, and finding the maximum spanning tree. Similarly, Heinemann and Globerson [2014] give a method to efficiently learn high-girth models where correlation decay limits the error of approximate inference, though this will not converge to the M-projection when the model is mis-specified.\nThis paper considers a fundamentally different notion of tractability, namely a guarantee that Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling will quickly converge to the stationary distribution. Our fundamental result is that if Θ is such a set, and one can project onto Θ, then there exists a FPRAS for the maximum likelihood solution inside Θ. While inspired by graphical models, this result works entirely in the exponential family framework, and applies generally to any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics.\nThe existence of a FPRAS is established by analyzing a common existing strategy for maximum likelihood learning of exponential families, namely gradient descent where MCMC is used to generate samples and approximate the gradient. It is natural to conjecture that, if the Markov chain is fast mixing, is run long enough, and enough gradient descent iterations are used, this will converge to nearly the optimum of the likelihood inside Θ, with high probability. This paper shows that this is indeed the case. A separate analysis is used for the ridge-regularized case (using strong convexity) and the unregularized case (which is merely convex)."

(v iterations of the\nMarkov chain corresponding to θk−1 from arbitrary starting distribution r.)\n• Θ - constraint set for θ • f - negative log-likelihood on training data • L - Lipschitz constant for the gradient of f . • θ∗ = argminθ∈Θ f(θ) - minimizer of likelihood inside of Θ • K - total number of gradient descent steps • M - total number of samples drawn via MCMC • N - length of vector x. • v - number of Markov chain transitions applied for each sample • C,α - parameters determining the mixing rate of the Markov chain. (Equation 3) • Ra - sufficient statistics norm bound. • ϵf - desired optimization accuracy for f • ϵθ - desired optimization accuracy for θ • δ - permitted probability of failure to achieve a given approximation accuracy\nThis paper is concerned with an exponential family of the form\npθ(x) = exp(θ · t(x)−A(θ)),\nwhere t(x) is a vector of sufficient statistics, and the log-partition function A(θ) ensures normalization. An undirected model can be seen as an exponential family where t consists of indicator functions for each possible configuration of each clique [32]. While such graphical models motivate this work, the results are most naturally stated in terms of an exponential family and apply more generally.\nWe are interested in performing maximum-likelihood learning, i.e. minimizing, for a dataset z1, ..., zD,\nf(θ) = − 1\nD\nD ∑\ni=1\nlog pθ(zi) + λ\n2 ∥θ∥22 = A(θ)− θ · t̄+\nλ 2 ∥θ∥22, (1)\nwhere we define t̄ = 1D ∑D i=1 t(zi). It is easy to see that the gradient of f takes the form\nf ′(θ) = Epθ [t(X)]− t̄+ λθ.\nIf one would like to optimize f using a gradient-based method, computing the expectation of t(X) with respect to pθ can present a computational challenge. With discrete graphical models, the expected value of t is determined by the marginal distributions of each factor in the graph. Typically, the computational difficulty of computing these marginal distributions is determined by the treewidth of the graph– if the graph is a tree, (or close to a tree) the marginals can be computed by the junction-tree algorithm [18]. One option, with high treewidth, is to approximate the marginals with a variational method. This can be seen as exactly optimizing a “surrogate likelihood” approximation of Eq. 1 [31].\nAnother common approach is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to compute a sample {xi}Mi=1 from a distribution close to pθ, and then approximate Epθ [t(X)] by (1/M) ∑M\ni=1 t(xi). This strategy is widely used, varying in the model type, the sampling algorithm, how samples are initialized, the details of optimization, and so on [10, 25, 27, 24, 7, 33, 11, 2, 29, 5]. Recently, Steinhardt and Liang [28] proposed learning in terms of the stationary distribution obtained from a chain with a nonzero restart probability, which is fast-mixing by design.\nWhile popular, such strategies generally lack theoretical guarantees. If one were able to exactly sample from pθ, this could be understood simply as stochastic gradient descent. But, with MCMC, one can only sample from a distribution approximating pθ, meaning the gradient estimate is not only noisy, but also biased. In general, one can ask how should the step size, number of iterations, number of samples, and number of Markov chain transitions be set to achieve a convergence level.\nThe gradient descent strategy analyzed in this paper, in which one updates a parameter vector θk using approximate gradients is outlined and shown as a cartoon in Figure 1. Here, and in the rest of the paper, we use pk as a shorthand for pθk , and we let ek denote the difference between the estimated gradient and the true gradient f ′(θk−1). The projection operator is defined by ΠΘ[φ] = argminθ∈Θ ||θ − φ||2.\nWe assume that the parameter set θ is constrained to a set Θ such that MCMC is guaranteed to mix at a certain rate (Section 3.1). With convexity, this assumption can bound the mean and variance\nof the errors at each iteration, leading to a bound on the sum of errors. With strong convexity, the error of the gradient at each iteration is bounded with high probability. Then, using results due to [26] for projected gradient descent with errors in the gradient, we show a schedule the number of iterations K , the number of samples M , and the number of Markov transitions v such that with high probability,\nf\n(\n1\nK\nK ∑\nk=1\nθk\n)\n− f (θ∗) ≤ ϵf or ∥θK − θ∗∥2 ≤ ϵθ,\nfor the convex or strongly convex cases, respectively, where θ∗ ∈ argminθ∈Θ f(θ). The total number of Markov transitions applied through the entire algorithm, KMv grows as (1/ϵf)3 log(1/ϵf) for the convex case, (1/ϵ2θ) log(1/ϵ 2 θ) for the strongly convex case, and polynomially in all other parameters of the problem."

      "heading" : "3.1 Mixing times and Fast-Mixing Parameter Sets",
      "text" : "This Section discusses some background on mixing times for MCMC. Typically, mixing times are defined in terms of the total-variation distance ∥p−q∥TV = maxA |p(A)−q(A)|, where the maximum ranges over the sample space. For discrete distributions, this can be shown to be equivalent to ∥p− q∥TV = 12 ∑ x |p(x)− q(x)|.\nWe assume that a sampling algorithm is known, a single iteration of which can be thought of an operator Mθ that transforms some starting distribution into another. The stationary distribution is pθ, i.e. limv→∞ Mvθq = pθ for all q. Informally, a Markov chain will be fast mixing if the total variation distance between the starting distribution and the stationary distribution decays rapidly in the length of the chain. This paper assumes that a convex set Θ and constants C and α are known such that for all θ ∈ Θ and all distributions q,\n∥Mvθq − pθ∥TV ≤ Cαv. (2) This means that the distance between an arbitrary starting distribution q and the stationary distribution pθ decays geometrically in terms of the number of Markov iterations v. This assumption is justified by the Convergence Theorem [19, Theorem 4.9], which states that if M is irreducible and aperiodic with stationary distribution p, then there exists constants α ∈ (0, 1) and C > 0 such that\nd(v) := sup q ∥Mvq − p∥TV ≤ Cαv. (3)\nMany results on mixing times in the literature, however, are stated in a less direct form. Given a constant ϵ, the mixing time is defined by τ(ϵ) = min{v : d(v) ≤ ϵ}. It often happens that bounds on mixing times are stated as something like τ(ϵ) ≤ ⌈\na+ b ln 1ϵ ⌉\nfor some constants a and b. It follows from this that ∥Mvq − p∥TV ≤ Cαv with C = exp(a/b) and α = exp(−1/b).\nA simple example of a fast-mixing exponential family is the Ising model, defined for x ∈ {−1,+1}N as\np(x|θ) = exp\n⎛\n⎝\n∑\n(i,j)∈Pairs\nθijxixj + ∑\ni\nθixi −A(θ)\n⎞\n⎠ .\nA simple result for this model is that, if the maximum degree of any node is ∆ and |θij | ≤ β for all (i, j), then for univariate Gibbs sampling with random updates, τ(ϵ) ≤ ⌈ N log(N/ϵ)1−∆ tanh(β)⌉ [19]. The algorithm discussed in this paper needs the ability to project some parameter vector φ onto Θ to find argminθ∈Θ ||θ−φ||2. Projecting a set of arbitrary parameters onto this set of fast-mixing parameters is trivial– simply set θij = β for θij > β and θij ← −β for θij < −β.\nFor more dense graphs, it is known [12, 9] that, for a matrix norm ∥ ·∥ that is the spectral norm ∥ ·∥2, or induced 1 or infinity norms,\nτ(ϵ) ≤ ⌈ N log(N/ϵ)\n1− ∥R(θ)∥\n⌉\n(4)\nwhere Rij(θ) = |θij |. Domke and Liu [2013] show how to perform this projection for the Ising model when ∥ · ∥ is the spectral norm ∥ · ∥2 with a convex optimization utilizing the singular value decomposition in each iteration.\nLoosely speaking, the above result shows that univariate Gibbs sampling on the Ising model is fastmixing, as long as the interaction strengths are not too strong. Conversely, Jerrum and Sinclair [1993] exhibited an alternative Markov chain for the Ising model that is rapidly mixing for arbitrary interaction strengths, provided the model is ferromagnetic, i.e. that all interaction strengths are positive with θij ≥ 0 and that the field is unidirectional. This Markov chain is based on sampling in different “subgraphs world” state-space. Nevertheless, it can be used to estimate derivatives of the Ising model log-partition function with respect to parameters, which allows estimation of the gradient of the log-likelihood. Huber [2012] provided a simulation reduction to obtain an Ising model sample from a subgraphs world sample.\nMore generally, Liu and Domke [2014] consider a pairwise Markov random field, defined as\np(x|θ) = exp\n⎛\n⎝\n∑\ni,j\nθij(xi, xj) + ∑\ni\nθi(xi)−A(θ)\n⎞\n⎠ ,\nand show that, if one defines Rij(θ) = maxa,b,c 1 2 |θij(a, b)−θij(a, c)|, then again Equation 4 holds. An algorithm for projecting onto the set Θ = {θ : ∥R(θ)∥ ≤ c} exists.\nThere are many other mixing-time bounds for different algorithms, and different types of models [19]. The most common algorithms are univariate Gibbs sampling (often called Glauber dynamics in the mixing time literature) and Swendsen-Wang sampling. The Ising model and Potts models are the most common distributions studied, either with a grid or fully-connected graph structure. Often, the motivation for studying these systems is to understand physical systems, or to mathematically characterize phase-transitions in mixing time that occur as interactions strengths vary. As such, many existing bounds assume uniform interaction strengths. For all these reasons, these bounds typically require some adaptation for a learning setting."

Again, the main difficulty in this proof is showing that the sum of the errors of estimated gradients at each iteration is small.

Applying this to all iterations using δ′ = δ/K gives that all errors are simultaneously bounded as before. This can then be used in another result due to Schmidt et al. [26] on the convergence of gradient descent with errors in estimated gradients in the strongly convex case.\nA similar proof strategy could be used for the convex case where, rather than directly bounding the sum of the norm of errors of all steps using the Efron-Stein inequality and Bernstein’s bound, one could simply bound the error of each step using a multidimensional Hoeffding-type inequality, and then apply this with probability δ/K to each step. This yields a slightly weaker result than that shown in Theorem 2. The reason for applying a uniform bound on the errors in gradients here is that Schmidt et al.’s bound [26] on the convergence of proximal gradient descent on strongly convex functions depends not just on the sum of the norms of gradient errors, but a non-uniform weighted variant of these.\nAgain, we consider how to set parameters to guarantee that θK is not too far from θ∗ with a minimum amount of work.

The sufficient statistics are t(x) = {xixj |(i, j) ∈ Pairs}, and with 24 pairs, ∥t(x)∥2 ≤ R2 = √ 24. For a fast-mixing set, constrain |θij | ≤ .2 for all pairs.

      "heading" : "7 Conclusions",
      "text" : "This section discusses some weaknesses of the above analysis, and possible directions for future work. Analyzing complexity in terms of the total sampling effort ignores the complexity of projection itself. Since projection only needs to be done K times, this time will often be very small in comparison to sampling time. (This is certainly true in the above example.) However, this might not be the case if the projection algorithm scales super-linearly in the size of the model.\nAnother issue to consider is how the samples are initialized. As far as the proof of correctness goes, the initial distribution r is arbitrary. In the above example, a simple uniform distribution was used. However, one might use the empirical distribution of the training data, which is equivalent to contrastive divergence [5]. It is reasonable to think that this will tend to reduce the mixing time when the pθ is close to the model generating the data. However, the number of Markov chain transitions v prescribed above is larger than typically used with contrastive divergence, and Algorithm 1 does not reduce the step size over time. While it is common to regularize to encourage fast mixing with contrastive divergence [14, Section 10], this is typically done with simple heuristic penalties. Further, contrastive divergence is often used with hidden variables. Still, this provides a bound for how closely a variant of contrastive divergence could approximate the maximum likelihood solution.\nThe above analysis does not encompass the common strategy for maximum likelihood learning where one maintains a “pool” of samples between iterations, and initializes one Markov chain at each iteration from each element of the pool. The idea is that if the samples at the previous iteration were close to pk−1 and pk−1 is close to pk, then this provides an initialization close to the current solution. However, the proof technique used here is based on the assumption that the samples xki at each iteration are independent, and so cannot be applied to this strategy."

One way to overcome this is to restrict parameters to a tractable set, most typically the set of tree-structured parameters. This paper explores an alternative notion of a tractable set, namely a set of “fast-mixing parameters” where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution. While it is common in practice to approximate the likelihood gradient using samples obtained from MCMC, such procedures lack theoretical guarantees. This paper proves that for any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, (not just graphical models) when parameters are constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set with high-probability. When unregularized, to find a solution ε-accurate in log-likelihood requires a total amount of effort cubic in 1/ε, disregarding logarithmic factors. When ridge-regularized, strong convexity allows a solution ε-accurate in parameter distance with effort quadratic in 1/ε. Both of these provide of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme.",
