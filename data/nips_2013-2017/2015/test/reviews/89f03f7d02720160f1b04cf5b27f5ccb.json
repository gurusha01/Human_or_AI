{"title": "A Pseudo-Euclidean Iteration for Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA", "abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular model for blind signal separation. The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals are linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm, PEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for ICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite \u201cinner product\u201d) space. The use of this indefinite \u201cinner product\u201d resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm which is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing.Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct approach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for signal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA literature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction problem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact that SINR itself cannot be computed from data. That allows us to obtain a practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise.", "id": "89f03f7d02720160f1b04cf5b27f5ccb", "authors": ["James R.

However some key references of related work are missing (see below).\n\noriginality:\n\nThe approach is similar to the well-known fastICA\n\nmethod and the GI-ICA [21] (Voss et al.,NIPS 2013), however it differs from those methods in an important aspect: It does neither rely on the pre-whitening (orthogonalization) step nor on \"quasi-whithening\" (quasi-orthogonalization).\n\nThe main contributions\n\n(1)\n\ngradient-based fixed point iterations for kurtosis maximisation are done in a pseudo-Euclidean space\n\n(2) analysis and insight how to choose this pseudo-Euclidean space optimally for the noisy ICA case\n\nare technically sound and sufficiently novel.\n\n Significance:\n\nPerforming ICA in the noise-corrupted setting is an important problem of potential interest to the NIPS crowd.\n\nThough the robustness to Gaussian noise is inherent to all higher-order cumulant-based approaches and is well know, the proposed method to integrate this into a fixed-point algorithm is admittedly elegant and thus the contribution can be considered significant.\n\n A further plus is the straightforward extension to the complex case (which is shown in supplemental material)\n\n The experimental section is a bit weak, only synthetic data is considered and many other robust ICA methods are not included in comparison.\n\nAt least experimental results demonstrating improvements over GI-ICA indicate that the cumbersome quasi-orthogonalization as in [21] is no longer needed.\n\nOn the other hand there exist many methods for the noisy ICA problem. In particular, the algorithm in [R2] \"RobustICA\" would be the real competitor, because as shown in [R3] the fixed-point algorithm can be seen as a special case of gradient descent with an optimally selected stepsize as proposed in [R2] but such a comparison is not included. Also the relative Newton method of Zibulevsky [R5] for minimization of a quasi-ML cost function would have provided a better baseline.\n\nA further issue is that the estimation of 4-th order cumulants / kurtosis in general needs a LOT of data (1e+5--1e+6 samples are often needed, as can be seen from figure 2)\n\nFurthermore the practical usefulness for real-world data remains to be demonstrated.\n\nfurther comments:\n\n-It would be recommended to compare fastICA with pow3 not tanh nonlinearity in Fig1\n\n-Why is the iteration index k omitted in algorithm 2 ?\n\n additional references:\n\n[R1] Sergio Cruces, A.

The algorithm is based on a gradient iteration in a pseudo-Euclidian space where the inner product is based on the Hessian of the contrast function (ie. the kurtosis). The authors show that with probability 1 the algorithm extracts the normalized columns of the mixing matrix. Then they show that the extracted mixing matrix estimate can be used to make an SINR-optimal recovery of the sources.\n\n The disadvantage of the method is that it needs a large number of samples N (in the example of Fig 1a, over 50,000 samples) in order to outperform standard ICA methods such as JADE, FastICA, or 1FICA.\n\n Moreover, compared to the existing GI-ICA method [21] it is not siginificantly superior for large data sets (Fig 2 shows marginal improvement over GI-ICA for N>50,000).\n\n The presentation of the paper is quite clear and the proposed method includes originality. Moreover the theoretical results regarding convergence and the optimal SINR reconstruction theorem count towards the positive points of the paper. However, the limitations mentioned above weaken the significance of the method. Perhaps the authors could strengthen it by identifying specific signal or noise settings where PEGI clearly outperforms standard methods like FastICA or JADE. Otherwise it can be yet another run-of-the-mill method within the multitude of methods performing ICA.\n\n  A pseudo-Euclidian space algorithm suitable for noisy ICA. Clearly presented and original.

Since the conventional GI-ICA algorithm is based on an assumption that the columns of A are orthogonal, it requires a rather complicated preprocessing step called the quasi-orthogonalization to linearly transform the data to make columns of A orthogonal. The key innovation of the proposed method is to sidestep this process by formulating the signal recovery problem as a fixed point method in an indefinite inner product (pseudo-Euclidean) space.\n\nAlthough a line of the ICA research is well introduced in Section 1, the research on underdetermined blind signal separation (BSS) should also be briefly mentioned. By appending one column and one row in A and S, the noisy ICA model X = AS + n can be equivalently rewritten in the form X = A'S' where A' and S' denote the appended matrices. Practically, existing methods for underdetermined BSS can also be used to solve the signal recovery problem under this setting where the noise is treated as a source. In this regard, literature on underdetermined BSS are also somewhat relevant to this work, which I think should not be completely disregarded.\n\nThis paper seems to reuse many sentences from the following manuscript, which can downloaded from the internet: J. Voss, M. Belkin, L. Rademacher, \"Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA,\" 2015. To avoid any risk of being accused of plagiarism or self-plagiarism, I suggest the authors avoid using exactly the same sentences as much as possible.\n\nIt should be mentioned somewhere that $^\\dagger$ denotes the pseudo-inverse.\n\nA concluding section is missing.

The new method called PEGI may avoid the quasi-orthogonalization preprocessing step necessary in GI-ICA. The authors also give a general optimality result related to source recovery in noisy ICA.\n\n Overall, the paper is well written with high technical quality. The method (PEGI) is a reasonable and relevant extension of GI-ICA, and the result shows the method works reasonably. However most materials in Section 2 are from the GI-ICA paper and the modification to GI-ICA is relatively straightforward. In this regard, the contribution of this paper itself may be limited.\n\nThe additional optimality result (Section 3) is interesting in its own right but it looks quite fundamental so I'm skeptical about the novelty. At least a similar result can be found in: A. F. Naguib, \"Adaptive Antennas for CDMA Wireless Network,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA, 1996. (Chap.3), which seems to be an oft-cited reference related to beamforming. I'm also wondering how it could be related to source recovery based on MAP estimation, which is popularly used in probabilistic noisy ICA methods.\n\nThe presentation of the method needs some improvements in some specific points. First, at the first reading it was unclear to me how the gradient and hessian of kurtosis (eqs. 1 and 2) could be estimated from data. I found the detail in the GI-ICA paper [21] but the present paper should also describe or appropriately refer to the existing result. Second, it was difficult to figure out why the quasi-orthogonalization is problematic while PEGI is not, even though they both rely on the same matrix C. Some more detailed explanation on this point should be necessary to show the advantage (and motivation) of the new method more clearly.\n\n The method is reasonable and relevant extension of previously proposed GI-ICA method while the contribution of this paper itself seems relatively limited. The presentation should be improved in some specific points.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
