{"title": "Statistical Topological Data Analysis - A Kernel Perspective", "abstract": "We consider the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel which would enable a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.", "id": "74563ba21a90da13dacf2a73e3ddefa7", "authors": ["Roland Kwitt", "Stefan Huber", "Marc Niethammer", "Weili Lin", "Ulrich Bauer"], "conference": "NIPS2015", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "Summary:\n\n topological data analysis is a field which studies the geometric \"shape\" of a data set, using methods from algebraic topology. A tool that has been proven useful is the so-called persistent homology together the persistence diagrams. One is particularly interested in computing these persistence diagrams as they give the \"topological summary\" of the data shape. However a statistical treatment of these persistent diagrams is rather computationally expensive and difficult. A way to circumnavigate this difficulty goes by embedding probability measure on the space of persistence diagrams into a a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, since Hilbert spaces are highly regular and have an abundance of available well-studied methods that largely simplify calculations. Such an embedding can be achieved if the corresponding kernel is \"universal\", via the so-called \"mean map\". The paper proves that a slight modification of the recently introduced \"PSS kernel\", called the \"u-PSS kernel\", has the property of being \"universal\" (with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric) [prop 2]. For example, one can then test whether two different samples exhibit significantly different homological features, while avoiding the direct computation of persistence diagrams and reducing it to the evaluation of the corresponding kernel.\n\n Major negative points\n\n- The paper is generally hard to read for people not so familiar with algebraic topology or functional analysis. Despite the background chapter, several rather more advanced notions or results in functional analysis are assumed familiar and not explained in further detail. - Many relevant definitions, argumentations from other papers and calculations are rather sketchy or even omitted.\n\n- The core argumentation of the paper is not written down in a concise chronological \"start-to-finish argument\", rather the different pieces of the argument are spread out throughout the paper, randomly mixed in with different information of secondary importance which makes the reading at times rather confusing.\n\n- The actual contribution is the proof of proposition 2, which in turn just boils down to proving that (\\mathcal{S},d_{W,1}) is a compact metric, due to Theorem 1. In my opinion, the actual contribution is not that significant. The author mainly put together several already-published definitions and results, to achieve his result without introducing anything novel.\n\n Positive points\n\n- the field of topological data analysis is a rather new and exciting area with many interesting applications, and the result seems rather exciting. As algebraic topology is a rather powerful tool, however not frequently used due to its computational complexity, a result leading to implementations of reduced complexity can lead to interesting and very diverse implications. - the experiments /implementations illustrate well the generality of theoretical result, and the diversity of its applications.\n\nFinal conclusion: 5/10 (weak rejection)  Not enough theoretical and empirical content, writing not so great.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Summary:\n\nThe authors investigate the theoretical foundation of applying\n\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space based technique in expressing the topological invariances of the persistent homology. That investigation focuses on the universality of the potential kernel representation. They demonstrate the usefulness of their approach for example in two-sample hypothesis testing.\n\n General remarks: --- The statement of Proposition 2 can be reinterpreted since the exponential mapping applied there can be taken as a projection from the manifolds of the positive semidefinite kernels onto the corresponding tangent plane. Thus investigating the the properties of that manifold might yield some further ways to other kind of generalization. For example looking at the sensitivity of universality with respect to the local properties of that manifold might allows to extend the scope of that Proposition.\n\n --- In the paper only the solution of the heat diffusion problem is considered as a source of a possible kernel representation. What about other possibilities, for example some results in discrete differential geometry may provide other feature mapping exploitable in this context.\n\n --- The proposed approach is demonstrated via discriminative hypotheses testing. The usefulness of those tests can be checked against discriminative learning methods which can provide confirmation to the applicability. I think that kind of control tests should be carried out for example on a sample of randomly chosen point clouds representing balls and tori.\n\n  Pros: The authors provide a comprehensive introduction of the topological data analysis and the potential kernel representation of the corresponding problems.Cons:The authors do not give a clear view why the universality of a kernel can really help in a learning problem.

Universality of the kernel enables the use of kernelized hypothesis testing, which is applied to studying the topology of the underlying data space of both synthetic and real data.\n\nThe paper is very well written, although I would wish for it to be more self contained. The paper is sound and interesting, and opens up to kernel methods for topological data analysis which is novel as far as I know, except for the recently published kernel. The previous paper reduces the novelty, and the experimental validation does not shine light on whether the paper actually improves on the state-of-the art as there is no comparison to other methods. On the other hand, I think the paper might generate interesting discussions in the NIPS community.\n\n DETAILS\n\n*Completeness*\n\nIt would have been nice to see a more detailed discussion of topological data analysis, and persistence diagrams + Wasserstein distances in particular, as these are not mainstream topics at NIPS. I urge the authors to include this in their final version. Space could e.g. be taken from the current discussion of related work which is very much focused on the computation of means of persistence diagrams (no need to leave out references, just shorten the description, which is not crucial in this paper).\n\nSimilarly, it would be very helpful if you include definitions of terms like \"birth-death bounded\" (although I appreciate the reference). The average NIPS attendee might like to read your paper, but likely would not look up terms like this, so including definitions will largely increase your audience.\n\n *Proposition 2*\n\nI have a question regarding the proof of Proposition 2. It is not clear to me why f(\\mathcal{R}) = \\mathcal{S}, but this probably has to do with the lack of including the definition of \"birth-death bounded\"?\n\n *Experiments*\n\nIt would have been nice to see a comparison with other methods, e.g. permutation tests comparing means or variances of the data sets with respect to the Wasserstein distance, or comparing to shape analysis of the surfaces in section 4.2. It is left unclear whether the method improves on the state-of-the-art.\n\n TYPOS\n\nline 094: form -> from on page 3 your reference to [13] should probably come the minute you start talking about MMD, as this is not a contribution of your paper line 222: an function -> a function Interesting and well written paper which proves universality of a variant of a previously published kernel for topological data analysis.

I thought you meant the maximum multiplicity of any point is at\n\n most N, but it seems (after the discussion of the bounded subset of (R^2)^N\n\n that you are working with) that you mean the sum of multiplicities of\n\n off-diagonal points is at most N. It would be good to clarify this upfront.\n\n * In the paper, you down-play the requirements on bounded persistence and, more\n\n importantly, on bounded multiplicities. But, of course, it's a serious\n\n limitation. Especially odd is the argument that because we are interested in\n\n finite processes, we don't have to care. The type of theorem you present\n\n would probably be most useful in relating the persistence diagram of some\n\n smooth function (possibly perturbed by noise) to what you get from a finite\n\n approximation (to get inference-type results).

How is this possible? You seem to be taking\n\n sublevel sets of the distance functions, and you don't seem to be working\n\n with \"extended persistence.\" Do 0-dimensional features mean something other\n\n than \"we are looking at 0-dimensional homology\"? There are more issues like\n\n this in Section 4. This really needs to be clarified: it's very confusing.  The paper is an important contribution to bringing statistical foundations to the study of persistent homology (an algebraic topological descriptor of scalar functions). Roughly, it applies kernel methods and maps a persistence diagram to a scalar function over a plane. It shows that the resulting kernel is universal and that this fact is useful in practice. The results are strong and important, so I recommend the paper for publication.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
