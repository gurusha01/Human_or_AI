{"title": "Analysis of Robust PCA via Local Incoherence", "abstract": "We investigate the robust PCA problem of decomposing an observed matrix into the sum of a low-rank and a sparse error matrices via convex programming Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). In contrast to previous studies that assume the support of the error matrix is generated by uniform Bernoulli sampling, we allow non-uniform sampling, i.e., entries of the low-rank matrix are corrupted by errors with unequal probabilities. We characterize conditions on error corruption of each individual entry based on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix, under which correct matrix decomposition by PCP is guaranteed. Such a refined analysis of robust PCA captures how robust each entry of the low rank matrix combats error corruption. In order to deal with non-uniform error corruption, our technical proof introduces a new weighted norm and develops/exploits the concentration properties that such a norm satisfies.", "id": "43baa6762fa81bb43b39c62553b2970d", "authors": ["Huishuai Zhang", "Yi Zhou", "Yingbin Liang"], "conference": "NIPS2015", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The paper presents an analysis of the robust PCA problem (decompose M=L+S) but with random locations of the locations of the errors S and a local notion of incoherence.\n\n That is rather than a global incoherence of L, authors study local incoherence of each element of L. Using this notion, they derive tighter bounds for the number of non-zeros allowed in S.\n\n The result of the paper seems novel and somewhat interesting. The analysis follows the standard analysis but includes complications due to the local incoherence. However, it is not clear if the local incoherence indeed adds a lot of complication to the proof. Also, the main message or technique from the analysis is not concrete.\n\n So, despite the result being novel, it is not clear how interesting the analysis is and how important the result is.  See below.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Summary of paper:\n\nUntil recently, the related but different problems of matrix completion and robust PCA - via nuclear norm minimization - had similar assumptions under which recovery was known: incoherence of the low-rank matrix, and uniform randomness in the samples (for completion) or errors (for robust PCA).\n\n Recently however it was shown that for matrix completion recovery is provably possible, via same convex methods, even when the sampling is non-uniform, provided this non-uniformity is adapted to LOCAL coherence.\n\n This paper establishes a similar result for robust PCA, showing that if the errors are non-uniromly random (again in a way that is adapted to the same local coherences) then exact recovery is again possible.\n\nQuality:\n\nOverall the result is likely to be important and of interest. The techniques are new, but along lines somewhat similar to those employed in the (recent) matrix completion analysis using local coherence.\n\nThe experiments are not very convincing because the low-rank matrices are constructed to have very similar local coherences. It would have been better to see matrices with very different local coherences. This can be done by pre and post multiplying the low-rank matrices generated in the paper with diagonal matrices that have large dynamic range on the diagonal elements.\n\n Clarity:\n\nThe paper is clearly written, though by the very nature of what it is trying to do is a bit dense to read.\n\nOriginality:\n\nThe paper takes the new recent understanding of how local coherence can allow for non-uniformity in sampling for matrix completion, and extends it to the case of errors in robust PCA. The results are original.\n\nSignificance:\n\nRobust PCA has a huge number of applications, and by this token an improvement in its understanding is significant. However the paper does not provide any new method; but rather a better analysis of the already popular method. So its empirical significance may be lower.\n\nIt would have been nice to see specific examples where this kind of non-uniformity both naturally arises, and leads to appreciably better recovery. For example, does this imply that for the graph clustering problem with unequal size clusters, larger clusters can be sparser but still recover-able ? The paper proves interesting results on the ability of the standard robust PCA algorithm to recover from non-uniform errors, provided these are adapted to the local coherences of the matrix. The analysis follows along lines of recent work, but has a couple interesting innovations.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper considers the Robust PCA problem (\"low-rank plus sparse\") where the leverage scores (or local incoherence) of the low-rank matrix and the non-zero probabilities of the sparse matrix are allowed to vary across the entries. Sufficient conditions for exact recovery are provided in terms of local relations of the leverage scores and error probabilities.\n\n This paper is in line with previous work on matrix completion under a similar non-uniform setting. The analysis uses the techniques of golfing schemes and weighted norms, which are developed in previous work.\n\n My main concern is that applications of such a result are not immediately clear. In particular, what is a scenario where the error probabilities and leverage scores will happen to align with each other and satisfy the conditions in the paper? Unlike matrix completion where the observation probabilities might be controllable in certain cases, here the error probabilities are not. More discussion would help.\n\nThe clustering problem mentioned in the paper could be a potential application. As the local incoherence is related to the cluster sizes, perhaps larger clusters are allowed to have higher error probabilities? It would be useful to write down a corollary for this problem.\n\nOther comments:\n\n1) It would be helpful to formally write down the elimination/derandomization arguments for this non-uniform setting.\n\n2) The results involve both \\mu_0 and \\mu_1. It would help to explicitly point out in which part of the proof is \\mu_1 needed.\n\n  This paper extends previous work on matrix completion with non-uniform local incoherence. The theoretical results appear correct, and the proof is based on previously developed techniques. It would be good if the authors can better motivate the problem setting and discuss applications.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The authors provide an analysis of the Robust PCA problem when the sparse corruption follow a non-uniform Bernoulli distribution. The paper shows that in such a non-uniform situation, high probability recovery relies on local incoherence of the low-rank matrix. In particular, entries which are locally incoherent can tolerate more error.\n\nThe analysis builds on certain existing ideas in the literature, such as the golfing scheme. The results are presented both for the random sign setting as well as the fixed sign setting. The results do provide additional insights into the robust PCA problem.\n\nSome concerns regarding the work - clarifications on these may help the reader better understand the contribution. First, there has been considerable progress in convex demixing [1], which provides general geometric conditions under which recovery of the form S+L is possible - in fact, the scope of these developments are substantially more general. It will be important to contrast the proposed specific results to this body of work. Further, the local incoherence condition, while interesting, does not appear testable for a given problem. So, it is somewhat unclear how to use the condition in practice.\n\nThe analysis in the paper is based on weighted norm, which in itself is an interesting idea. But several conclusions concerning this norm can be found in your reference [9]. It will be important to clearly separate what is known, and what the current paper adds, and otherwise highlight the advantage of this norm for the current problem. Otherwise, the contributions come across as somewhat incremental.\n\nThe implications for cluster matrices is interesting. The experimental part is fine. It may be interesting to have some results on robust PCA after centering to see if one gets qualitatively different results.\n\nAdditional comments -\n\nPros:\n\nClear writing\n\nMany experiments\n\nCons:\n\nResults not put in proper context of existing related literature.\n\nDraws considerably from existing results, and comes across as incremental.\n\n[1] M.
