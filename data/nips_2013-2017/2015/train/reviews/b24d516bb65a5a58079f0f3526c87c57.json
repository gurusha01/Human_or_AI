{"title": "Anytime Influence Bounds and the Explosive Behavior of Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks", "abstract": "The paper studies transition phenomena in information cascades observed along a diffusion process over some graph. We introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion both in terms of influence and of explosion time. Using this concept, we prove tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, and we also provide an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical. Our contributions include formal definitions and tight lower bounds of critical explosion time. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results through several examples of information cascades used in epidemiology and viral marketing models. Finally, we provide a series of numerical experiments for various types of networks which confirm the tightness of the theoretical bounds.", "id": "b24d516bb65a5a58079f0f3526c87c57", "authors": ["Kevin Scaman", "R\u00e9mi Lemonnier", "Nicolas Vayatis"], "conference": "NIPS2015", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "This paper extends NIPS'14 paper [17] to upper bound the maximum influence and lower bound the time on the critical time of diffusion over networks. The particular insight is to use the Laplacian Hazard matrix (containing the laplace transform of the transmission rate function) as an extension of the harzard matrix in [17], and relate the size of influence (# of infected nodes) to the spectral radius of this matrix.\n\nThe authors have also shown a few specific cases of particular transmission probabilities over time, e.g. contant, exponential and SI/SIR.\n\n The insight and the derived bounds are novel. The paper is clearly laid out.\n\nI have not checked the accompanying proofs, they seem reasonable. It is also likely that I did not understood parts of the argument, hence the low confidence rating.  This paper extends NIPS'14 paper [17] to upper bound the maximum influence and lower bound the time on the critical time of diffusion over networks. This is a theoretical contribution that is novel, the influence bounds are shown to be tight visa simulation, and potentially applicable to algorithm and experimentation (not shown in this paper).", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "- It would to point out that p_ij(t) are actually subprobabilities, since \\int_{0}^{\\infty} p_{ij}(t) < 1.\n\n- Daneshmand et al. [ICML '14] also use the naming \"hazard matrix\" to denote a different quantity on a set of observed cascades. It would be useful to point out this, highlighting the differences.\n\n- In section 4.1., the authors do not explicitly state that \\alpha_{ij} in [0, 1). I think this is necessary for p_{ij}(t) to be a (sub)probability.\n\n- The writing of the first paragraph of the introduction could be heavily improved.\n\n- The authors refer to [3] as early work on influence maximization. [3] does not tackle the influence maximization problem, but a different one.\n\n- The proof of Lemma 3 could be described more explicitly. In particular, explicitly relate f(x), g(x) and \\mu(x) to the actual functions in the problem setting. This would help a reader to understand the definition of \"right positive correlation\", which is never formally written.\n\n- In Eq. (11) in the proof of Lemma 4, the authors should explicitly write what is a and x in ln(1 - ax) >= ln (1-a)x to help the reader.\n\n- In Eq. 12, should f_i(s) on the right side not be f_j(s)?\n\n- There is some very recent work that aims to establish the theoretical foundations of influence models. In particular, there are sample complexity results on the recovery of influence models:\n\nDaneshmand et al., ICML 2014 Pouget-Abadie et al., ICML 2015\n\nAlthough different to this work, it would help the reader understanding that there is already an on-going interest on the theoretical analysis of such models. The authors perform a theoretical analysis of diffusion of contagions in networks. In particular, they develop a novel non-asymptotic upper bound on the influence (average number of infected nodes) of any source set in a network and a lower bound on the critical time after which a contagion becomes super critical. The analysis uses the concept of Laplace Hazard matrix, an intuitive quantity, which depends on the network structure and edge probability distributions and is based on previous work. Their bounds are fairly general and the authors instantiate them on several well-known diffusion models. The authors also validate their theoretical results with a fairly brief (and perhaps too shallow) experimental evaluation on synthetic data.The problem is scientifically interesting and is timely. To the best of my knowledge, there is no previous work on influence bounds for continuous time diffusion networks. The paper is mathematically sound. The experimental results could be a bit more insightful/illustrative.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The authors studied the transition phenomena in information cascades by showing that the spectral radius of Laplace Hazard matrix can characterize the dynamics of the contagion. They focused on the non-asymptotic influence bounds, the super-critical time, and the tight lower bounds of critical explosion time.\n\nStrong points: 1. This work has in-deep theoretical bounds. 2. It focuses on network information cascades, which is a question of great concern to research community. 3. This paper is well organized and easy to read.\n\n Suggestions: Experiments can be improved to verify their theory. The authors evaluated the case of 'exponential transition probabilities'. They can also verify the cases of 'fixed transition pattern' and 'SI and SIR epidemic models'. The tightness in Fig.1 is only for fully connected networks?\n\n This paper extends the approach published by Lemonnier et al.[17] to deal with anytime influence bounds. The approach has strict theoretical bounds.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Understanding the process influence maximization is critical in several domains like epidemiology,\n\ncomputer networks, marketing, etc and the most widely used model to capture the temporal behavior in the cascade process is the CTIC model. Assessing the result quality is a challenge and prior work shows that the spectral radius of the Hazard matrix plays\n\na key role and derives a tight bound for the influence in a general graph. The authors extend the prior work to handle anytime influence bounds. They define when a contagion is sub-critical and super-critical and provide a lower bound when the contagion becomes super-critical and show the application to several contagion models. The proofs look comprehensive. The experimental results show the goodness of the model on the synthetic dataset but it would be useful to also see how the model scales up for large real graphs.\n\n The paper looks like a good paper and is well written.
