{"title": "Segregated Graphs and Marginals of Chain Graph Models", "abstract": "Bayesian networks are a popular representation of asymmetric (for example causal) relationships between random variables. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a complementary model of symmetric relationships used in computer vision, spatial modeling, and social and gene expression networks.  A chain graph model under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation (hereafter a chain graph model) generalizes both Bayesian networks and MRFs, and can represent asymmetric and symmetric relationships together.As in other graphical models, the set of marginals from distributions in a chain graph model induced by the presence of hidden variables forms a complex model.  One recent approach to the study of marginal graphical models is to consider a well-behaved supermodel.  Such a supermodel of marginals of Bayesian networks, defined only by conditional independences, and termed the ordinary Markov model, was studied at length in (Evans and Richardson, 2014).In this paper, we show that special mixed graphs which we call segregated graphs can be associated, via a Markov property, with supermodels of a marginal of chain graphs defined only by conditional independences.  Special features of segregated graphs imply the existence of a very natural factorization for these supermodels, and imply many existing results on the chain graph model, and ordinary Markov model carry over.  Our results suggest that segregated graphs define an analogue of the ordinary Markov model for marginals of chain graph models.", "id": "9ac403da7947a183884c18a67d3aa8de", "authors": ["Ilya Shpitser"], "conference": "NIPS2015", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The authors try to tackle the problem when bidirected edge (<->) and undirected edge (-) meet in a loopless mixed graph. They propose to construct a new mixed graph called segregated graph (SG) (where bidirected edge (<->) and undirected edge (-) never meet) which preserves all conditional independencies on the observed variables.\n\n I like the originality of the idea. I am somewhat disappointed by the clarity of the paper, which affects the quality too. Also the significance of the problem considered is not well addressed. Here I give more details on each criterion: *Clarity: I like the authors' explanation of the big picture before going to details, which helps to clarify to some degree. However, once we check the details, it becomes less clear caused by typos and undefined/undeclared symbols. It would be much easier to read if the authors follow notations in any of the well known (and recent) publications on this topic such as [4], [1*], and [2*].\n\n*Quality: it is dragged down by the level of clarity. Also I notice that if we move most of the proofs to the supplementary file, the paper would have much more spare space (2-3 pages perhaps). This suggests much more content can be added to the paper. *Originality: good. *Significance: the importance of the problem is only lightly touched (line 128-129) with a bit further discussion on the implication in conclusions.\n\n Missing references: [1*] Sadeghi, K. and Lauritzen, S.

Bidirected edges represent a common latent parent, while undirected edges capture a bidirectional causal relationship between variables, where A can cause B or vice versa. The overall model seems to be a combination of ADMGs and MRFs.\n\nSGs contain no partially directed cycles; also -- and <--> edges are not allowed to meet. These properties imply a factorization of the joint distribution that is a combination of ADMGs and MRF factors. If -- and <--> edges do meet in the original model, the authors show how to orient -- edges while preserving the conditional independencies; this is one of the main technical contributions.\n\n Quality: The paper is technically sound, and all claims are supported by rigorous proofs. There are no experiments, but the authors give examples of causal interactions for which SGs would be appropriate.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written; however it is very dense and some of the proofs are hard to follow. I had to draw diagrams on the margins in order to understand claims throughout the paper. The presentation would probably be clearer if the paper included more illustrative figures.\n\nOriginality: SGs were constructed by merging existing models, and as such are not that original (even though the work is highly non-trivial).\n\n Significance: Not very significant on its own, but might have impact on future work. SGs would be more interesting if accompanied by e.g. some new results on causal identifiability (that cannot be expressed using existing models), or an inference algorithm for some parametric family.  This is a high quality paper that describes segregated graphs (SGs), a novel graphical model over observed variables, consisting of bidirected, directed, and undirected edges. The model seems to combine ADMGs and MRS, and has a bit more flexibility in specifying causal relationships.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper proposes a reformulation of a large class of mixed graphical models that allows a series of factorization. The paper is quite technical and my main concern is that I did not really to what extant the proposed representation can simplifying some problems or reduce the complexity of some inference algorithm.\n\n I fear that the 8-page NIPS format does not fit for this kind of work, which would need a series of illustration to examplify the progress it allows.\n\n  See below", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Hidden variables in Bayesian networks and in chain graphs add extra complexity to parameter learning and to inference. Mixed graphical models introduce bi-directed edges that can eliminate the hidden variables while preserving the conditional independencies induced by the DAG or chain graph representations. However, after applying latent projection operation to eliminate the hidden variable in the resulting mixed graphs, bi-directional and undirected edges can meet, which leads to issues when trying to factorize the model.\n\nAs a solution segregated graphs are proposed, which preserve the conditional independencies between the non-latent random variables in the original DAG or chain graph, and at the same time they avoid having nodes where undirected and bi-directed edges meet.\n\nClarity: The introduction uses notations that are only introduced in the background section, which makes the reading of the paper more difficult.\n\n Significance: It is hard to judge the paper's significance without having a real world practical example and its evaluation at hand.\n\nTypo: line 099 \"...B_1,Y_1...\" -> \"B_1,Y_2\"  Segregated graphs are proposed, which can preserve conditional independencies between non-latent random variables in a Bayesian network or chain graph, while eliminating latent variables without introducing nodes where undirected and bi-directed edges meet.
