{"title": "Deep Knowledge Tracing", "abstract": "Knowledge tracing, where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework, is an established and significantly unsolved problem in computer supported education.In this paper we explore the benefit of using recurrent neural networks to model student learning.This family of models have important advantages over current state of the art methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge,and have a far more flexible functional form which can capture substantially more complex student interactions.We show that these neural networks outperform the current state of the art in prediction on real student data,while allowing straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in the curriculum.These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing.", "id": "bac9162b47c56fc8a4d2a519803d51b3", "authors": ["Chris Piech", "Jonathan Bassen", "Jonathan Huang", "Surya Ganguli", "Mehran Sahami", "Leonidas J.

The system is evaluated according to its ability to predict the exercices on which a given student will succeed or not. The authors present a LSTM RNN architecture to tackle this problem and demonstrate the performance improvement over BKT standard method.\n\nThis article is an well documented application paper on knowledge tracing, where LSTM RNN seems to be a great advance. Dataset & baselines are relevant and the authors give their code in supplementary material: this effort should be remarked. However, it would have been necessary to add a small README to make the code usable easily.\n\nThe organization of the paper should be cleaned: the definition of knowledge tracing in subsection 1.1 is alone and it should not be part of the introduction. On top of that, section 4 is strange: it should be split and integrated in the introduction and the related work.\n\n I do not understand the motivation is using AUC as evaluation metrics: why not relying on accuracy? This choice is not motivated and does not seem to be the reference in knowledge tracing (even if I am not an expert of the field and I saw that Fig 3 presents also accuracy).\n\nSec 6.2 (and supplementary material) is interesting. Could you imagine a way to build a quantitative evaluation of this task?\n\nIn conclusion, I found this article interesting and well written.

Personally, I think that \"not complicated\" is a good thing, but for some, this might be considered a negative. The paper is a novel application of an existing technique to an existing problem. As mentioned already, the improvement is very large and should be significant for the computer-assisted education field.
