{"title": "Recursive Training of 2D-3D Convolutional Networks for Neuronal Boundary Prediction", "abstract": "Efforts to automate the reconstruction of neural circuits from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images are critical for the field of connectomics. An important computation for reconstruction is the detection of neuronal boundaries. Images acquired by serial section EM, a leading 3D EM technique, are highly anisotropic, with inferior quality along the third dimension. For such images, the 2D max-pooling convolutional network has set the standard for performance at boundary detection. Here we achieve a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations. Following the trend towards deeper networks for object recognition, we use a much deeper network than previously employed for boundary detection. Second, we incorporate 3D as well as 2D filters, to enable computations that use 3D context. Finally, we adopt a recursively trained architecture in which a first network generates a preliminary boundary map that is provided as input along with the original image to a second network that generates a final boundary map. Backpropagation training is accelerated by ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed. Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture could be more generally applicable to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video, and our recursive framework for any image labeling problem.", "id": "39dcaf7a053dc372fbc391d4e6b5d693", "authors": ["Kisuk Lee", "Aleksandar Zlateski", "Vishwanathan Ashwin", "H.

Following advances in convnets for image recognition, the base architecture is made deeper, with smaller convolutions. The output from the 2D network is then used to initialize a 3D network, with further improvements in segmentation accuracy.\n\nIn terms of quality, the paper presents a clear advance in the state of the art on a challenging and important problem. The experiments use a number of metrics, both subjective and quantitative, to demonstrate their improvements. I would have liked to see experiments on a larger variety of datasets, and possibly larger datasets, since scaling is a major concern in connectomics applications. I would also hope future work more thoroughly compares against methods beyond the ISBI 2012 winner, including many of the papers they cite, and more recent advances such as this: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04304.pdf\n\nThe paper is very clearly presented. There is not much in the way of dense derivations, since the architecture is a straightforward combination of existing parts. The figures are well-organized and thorough.\n\nIn terms of originality, some ideas are imported from other application areas (which is valuable in its own right, to see if those ideas can generalize beyond their original domain) while others derive inspiration from understanding of the biological visual system. None of the parts of this architecture are wildly original or complicated, which I see as a virtue, as it will be easy for practitioners in the field to adopt.\n\nThis paper is significant in that automating EM segmentation has the potential to revolutionize neuroscience. While this is an incremental advance in that direction, any improvements in efficiency are useful to the community and should be shared. The authors present a novel convolutional neural network architecture for segmenting connectomics data. They present convincing evidence that their method leads to superior segmentation on this challenging and important problem.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper proposed to use a composition of a ConvNet with 2D filters and a ConvNet with 3D filters to improve the quality of neural boundary prediction. The authors motivate their architectural choice by the anisotropy (x-y vs z) of the sequential EM scans often used in Neuroscience. Their methods clearly outperforms the previous method (only using 2D filters) on this task which is important for their application.\n\nThe quality of the presentation could be easily improved and presentation could be streamlined. The method employs previously suggested techniques such as the recursive (composition) of nets and the application of 3D filters for 3D data sets.\n\nThe paper has unfortunately some problems. The paper refers often to the implementation ZNN (apparently theirs) that is mentioned to be crucial to get it efficient on the size of the network and the amount of data. However, there is no reference provided nor sufficient details are provided to reproduce it. I suggest to actually provide concise details on the essential parts of the implementation and also on whether the software will be released in some way. Otherwise the paper is full of general design choices used to develop ZNN that are not precise enough. The captions to the figures should be more descriptive, as important information is missing to understand them.\n\nDetails: l80: no reference for ZNN is provided. The reader has no idea what ZNN is. Is it an algorithm or a particular implementation? l177: the description of the Rand index is not sufficiently clear. There is a reference, but the paper should be self-consistent. Please provide the necessary formula. Section 3: This section does not really help to understand the paper. ZNN is not described in enough detail to reproduce the results. I suggest to give more precise details, or provide a reference to the resource where details can be found. Figure 3: color code? l393: In Fig 1 and the rest of the paper you have not used net1 and net2, please be consistent l396: As a comment: recursive seems not to be the right term for because it is not the same network that is recursively applied. It is the composition if vd2d an vd2d3d, although they share the same first layers. Is the vd2d part actually the same or just copied after the initial training and then refined independently?\n\n  The paper is relevant, but rather applied. The presentation needs improvements.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "In this paper the authors discuss a new deep convolutional network employed for for segmentation of neurons in EM image stacks. The novelty fo teh paper is the arrangement of filters in quite deep networks and the inclusion of 3D filters. Overall the paper is of good quality and is well-written/clear. The authors appear to have improved on previous methods and the application area is quite important for neuroscience. Overall I think it is worth presenting even if there are not necessarily any new fundamental insights about the method (other than the detailed architecture).  A good paper even if the novelty appears to be a bit in the details.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper proposes a 2D-3D convolutional network to detect neuronal boundary from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain image. Different from the traditional convolutional network, the proposed method uses both 3D and 2D filters to encode the information in EM image sequence. In the training stage, a recursive schema is applied to effectively learn 3D features from 2D initialization. Further, ZNN is applied for more efficient computation. The proposed method is tested on cortex images. Compared with base2D and VD2D models, the proposed 2D-3D model achieves lower error rate.\n\nThe paper is in general well written and easy to understand. The proposed method shows novelty in neuronal boundary detection and has potential to be applied to other sequential data such as video frames.\n\nHowever, the experiment part is not strong enough. Although 2D-3D model demonstrates more accurate boundary detection compared with 2D models, further experiments should be carried out, such as the comparison experiments against the state-of-the-art in boundary detection.\n\n The paper is interesting and generally well written. More comparison to the state-of-the-art in neuronal boundary detection is needed to demonstrated the power of the proposed method in such an application.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The subject matter of the paper is very far out of my area of expertise. I found the paper clear and the motivations for the architecture convincing and intuitive, and the results support the hypothesis, so it seems like a good contribution. I am incapable of giving a more in-depth analysis than this, I'm afraid, and encourage the committee and authors to rely more on the other reviews. This paper provides a novel architecture for the detection of neuronal boundaries in 3d scans. The main contribution is the interpolation of boundary classifications from 3d convnets and 2d convenets, which, combined, produce improved results.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
