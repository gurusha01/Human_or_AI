      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "One of the most challenging problems in large-scale machine learning is how to parallelize the training of large models that use a form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [1]. There have been attempts to parallelize SGD-based training for large-scale deep learning models on large number of CPUs, including the Google’s Distbelief system [2]. But practical image recognition systems consist of large-scale convolutional neural networks trained on few GPU cards sitting in a single computer [3, 4]. The main challenge is to devise parallel SGD algorithms to train large-scale deep learning models that yield a significant speedup when run on multiple GPU cards.\nIn this paper we introduce the Elastic Averaging SGD method (EASGD) and its variants. EASGD is motivated by quadratic penalty method [5], but is re-interpreted as a parallelized extension of the averaging SGD algorithm [6]. The basic idea is to let each worker maintain its own local parameter, and the communication and coordination of work among the local workers is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the master. The center variable is updated as a moving average where the average is taken in time and also in space over the parameters computed by local workers. The main contribution of this paper is a new algorithm that provides fast convergent minimization while outperforming DOWNPOUR method [2] and other\nbaseline approaches in practice. Simultaneously it reduces the communication overhead between the master and the local workers while at the same time it maintains high-quality performance measured by the test error. The new algorithm applies to deep learning settings such as parallelized training of convolutional neural networks.\nThe article is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the problem setting, Section 3 presents the synchronous EASGD algorithm and its asynchronous and momentum-based variants, Section 4 provides stability analysis of EASGD and ADMM in the round-robin scheme, Section 5 shows experimental results and Section 6 concludes. The Supplement contains additional material including additional theoretical analysis."

      "heading" : "2 Problem setting",
      "text" : "Consider minimizing a function F (x) in a parallel computing environment [7] with p ∈ N workers and a master. In this paper we focus on the stochastic optimization problem of the following form\nmin x F (x) := E[f(x, ξ)], (1)\nwhere x is the model parameter to be estimated and ξ is a random variable that follows the probability distribution P over Ω such that F (x) = ∫ Ω f(x, ξ)P(dξ). The optimization problem in Equation 1 can be reformulated as follows\nmin x1,...,xp,x̃ p∑ i=1 E[f(xi, ξi)] + ρ 2 ‖xi − x̃‖2, (2)\nwhere each ξi follows the same distribution P (thus we assume each worker can sample the entire dataset). In the paper we refer to xi’s as local variables and we refer to x̃ as a center variable. The problem of the equivalence of these two objectives is studied in the literature and is known as the augmentability or the global variable consensus problem [8, 9]. The quadratic penalty term ρ in Equation 2 is expected to ensure that local workers will not fall into different attractors that are far away from the center variable. This paper focuses on the problem of reducing the parameter communication overhead between the master and local workers [10, 2, 11, 12, 13]. The problem of data communication when the data is distributed among the workers [7, 14] is a more general problem and is not addressed in this work. We however emphasize that our problem setting is still highly non-trivial under the communication constraints due to the existence of many local optima [15]."

      "text" : "The EASGD updates captured in resp. Equation 3 and 4 are obtained by taking the gradient descent step on the objective in Equation 2 with respect to resp. variable xi and x̃,\nxit+1 = x i t − η(git(xit) + ρ(xit − x̃t)) (3)\nx̃t+1 = x̃t + η p∑ i=1 ρ(xit − x̃t), (4)\nwhere git(x i t) denotes the stochastic gradient of F with respect to x i evaluated at iteration t, xit and x̃t denote respectively the value of variables xi and x̃ at iteration t, and η is the learning rate.\nThe update rule for the center variable x̃ takes the form of moving average where the average is taken over both space and time. Denote α = ηρ and β = pα, then Equation 3 and 4 become\nxit+1 = x i t − ηgit(xit)− α(xit − x̃t) (5)\nx̃t+1 = (1− β)x̃t + β\n( 1\np p∑ i=1 xit\n) . (6)\nNote that choosing β = pα leads to an elastic symmetry in the update rule, i.e. there exists an symmetric force equal to α(xit − x̃t) between the update of each xi and x̃. It has a crucial influence on the algorithm’s stability as will be explained in Section 4. Also in order to minimize the staleness [16] of the difference xit − x̃t between the center and the local variable, the update for the master in Equation 4 involves xit instead of x i t+1.\nNote also that α = ηρ, where the magnitude of ρ represents the amount of exploration we allow in the model. In particular, small ρ allows for more exploration as it allows xi’s to fluctuate further from the center x̃. The distinctive idea of EASGD is to allow the local workers to perform more exploration (small ρ) and the master to perform exploitation. This approach differs from other settings explored in the literature [2, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], and focus on how fast the center variable converges. In this paper we show the merits of our approach in the deep learning setting."

      "heading" : "3.1 Asynchronous EASGD",
      "text" : "We discussed the synchronous update of EASGD algorithm in the previous section. In this section we propose its asynchronous variant. The local workers are still responsible for updating the local variables xi’s, whereas the master is updating the center variable x̃. Each worker maintains its own clock ti, which starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 after each stochastic gradient update of xi as shown in Algorithm 1. The master performs an update whenever the local workers finished τ steps of their gradient updates, where we refer to τ as the communication period. As can be seen in Algorithm 1, whenever τ divides the local clock of the ith worker, the ith worker communicates with the master and requests the current value of the center variable x̃. The worker then waits until the master sends back the requested parameter value, and computes the elastic difference α(x− x̃) (this entire procedure is captured in step a) in Algorithm 1). The elastic difference is then sent back to the master (step b) in Algorithm 1) who then updates x̃.\nThe communication period τ controls the frequency of the communication between every local worker and the master, and thus the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\nAlgorithm 1: Asynchronous EASGD: Processing by worker i and the master\nInput: learning rate η, moving rate α, communication period τ ∈ N Initialize: x̃ is initialized randomly, xi = x̃, ti = 0 Repeat x← xi if (τ divides ti) then\na) xi ← xi − α(x− x̃) b) x̃ ← x̃ + α(x− x̃)\nend xi ← xi − ηgiti(x) ti ← ti + 1\nUntil forever\nAlgorithm 2: Asynchronous EAMSGD: Processing by worker i and the master\nInput: learning rate η, moving rate α, communication period τ ∈ N, momentum term δ Initialize: x̃ is initialized randomly, xi = x̃, vi = 0, ti = 0 Repeat x← xi if (τ divides ti) then\na) xi ← xi − α(x− x̃) b) x̃ ← x̃ + α(x− x̃)\nend vi ← δvi − ηgiti(x+ δv\ni) xi ← xi + vi ti ← ti + 1\nUntil forever"

      "heading" : "4 Stability analysis of EASGD and ADMM in the round-robin scheme",
      "text" : "In this section we study the stability of the asynchronous EASGD and ADMM methods in the roundrobin scheme [20]. We first state the updates of both algorithms in this setting, and then we study\ntheir stability. We will show that in the one-dimensional quadratic case, ADMM algorithm can exhibit chaotic behavior, leading to exponential divergence. The analytic condition for the ADMM algorithm to be stable is still unknown, while for the EASGD algorithm it is very simple1.\nThe analysis of the synchronous EASGD algorithm, including its convergence rate, and its averaging property, in the quadratic and strongly convex case, is deferred to the Supplement.\nIn our setting, the ADMM method [9, 27, 28] involves solving the following minimax problem2,\nmax λ1,...,λp min x1,...,xp,x̃ p∑ i=1 F (xi)− λi(xi − x̃) + ρ 2 ‖xi − x̃‖2, (8)\nwhere λi’s are the Lagrangian multipliers. The resulting updates of the ADMM algorithm in the round-robin scheme are given next. Let t ≥ 0 be a global clock. At each t, we linearize the function F (xi) with F (xit) + 〈 ∇F (xit), xi − xit 〉 + 12η ∥∥xi − xit∥∥2 as in [28]. The updates become λit+1 = { λit − (xit − x̃t) if mod (t, p) = i− 1; λit if mod (t, p) 6= i− 1. (9)\nxit+1 =\n{ xit−η∇F (x i t)+ηρ(λ i t+1+x̃t)\n1+ηρ if mod (t, p) = i− 1; xit if mod (t, p) 6= i− 1.\n(10)\nx̃t+1 = 1\np p∑ i=1 (xit+1 − λit+1). (11)\nEach local variable xi is periodically updated (with period p). First, the Lagrangian multiplier λi is updated with the dual ascent update as in Equation 9. It is followed by the gradient descent update of the local variable as given in Equation 10. Then the center variable x̃ is updated with the most recent values of all the local variables and Lagrangian multipliers as in Equation 11. Note that since the step size for the dual ascent update is chosen to be ρ by convention [9, 27, 28], we have re-parametrized the Lagrangian multiplier to be λit ← λit/ρ in the above updates. The EASGD algorithm in the round-robin scheme is defined similarly and is given below\nxit+1 = { xit − η∇F (xit)− α(xit − x̃t) if mod (t, p) = i− 1; xit if mod (t, p) 6= i− 1.\n(12)\nx̃t+1 = x̃t + ∑\ni: mod (t,p)=i−1\nα(xit − x̃t). (13)\nAt time t, only the i-th local worker (whose index i−1 equals tmodulo p) is activated, and performs the update in Equations 12 which is followed by the master update given in Equation 13.\nWe will now focus on the one-dimensional quadratic case without noise, i.e. F (x) = x 2\n2 , x ∈ R.\nFor the ADMM algorithm, let the state of the (dynamical) system at time t be st = (λ1t , x 1 t , . . . , λ p t , x p t , x̃t) ∈ R2p+1. The local worker i’s updates in Equations 9, 10, and 11 are composed of three linear maps which can be written as st+1 = (F i3 ◦ F i2 ◦ F i1)(st). For simplicity, we will only write them out below for the case when i = 1 and p = 2:\nF 11=  1 −1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 , F 12=  1 0 0 0 0 ηρ 1+ηρ 1−η 1+ηρ 0 0 ηρ 1+ηρ 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 , F 13=  1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 − 1 p 1 p − 1 p 1 p 0 .\nFor each of the p linear maps, it’s possible to find a simple condition such that each map, where the ith map has the form F i3 ◦ F i2 ◦ F i1, is stable (the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the map are\n1This condition resembles the stability condition for the synchronous EASGD algorithm (Condition 17 for p = 1) in the analysis in the Supplement.\n2The convergence analysis in [27] is based on the assumption that “At any master iteration, updates from the workers have the same probability of arriving at the master.”, which is not satisfied in the round-robin scheme.\nsmaller or equal to one). However, when these non-symmetric maps are composed one after another as follows F = F p3 ◦F p 2 ◦F p 1 ◦ . . .◦F 13 ◦F 12 ◦F 11 , the resulting map F can become unstable! (more precisely, some eigenvalues of the map can sit outside the unit circle in the complex plane).\nWe now present the numerical conditions for which the ADMM algorithm becomes unstable in the round-robin scheme for p = 3 and p = 8, by computing the largest absolute eigenvalue of the map F . Figure 1 summarizes the obtained result.\nOn the other hand, the EASGD algorithm involves composing only symmetric linear maps due to the elasticity. Let the state of the (dynamical) system at time t be st = (x1t , . . . , x p t , x̃t) ∈ Rp+1. The activated local worker i’s update in Equation 12 and the master update in Equation 13 can be written as st+1 = F i(st). In case of p = 2, the map F 1 and F 2 are defined as follows\nF 1=\n( 1− η − α 0 α\n0 1 0 α 0 1− α\n) , F 2= ( 1 0 0 0 1− η − α α 0 α 1− α ) For the composite map F p ◦ . . . ◦ F 1 to be stable, the condition that needs to be satisfied is actually the same for each i, and is furthermore independent of p (since each linear map F i is symmetric).\nIt essentially involves the stability of the 2 × 2 matrix (\n1− η − α α α 1− α\n) , whose two (real)\neigenvalues λ satisfy (1− η − α− λ)(1− α− λ) = α2. The resulting stability condition (|λ| ≤ 1) is simple and given as 0 ≤ η ≤ 2, 0 ≤ α ≤ 4−2η4−η ."

We start with the experiment on CIFAR dataset with p = 4 local workers running on a single computing node. For all the methods, we examined the communication periods from the following set τ = {1, 4, 16, 64}. For comparison we also report the performance of MSGD which outperformed SGD, ASGD and MVASGD as shown in Figure 6 in the Supplement. For each method we examined a wide range of learning rates (the learning rates explored in all experiments are summarized in Table 1, 2, 3 in the Supplement). The CIFAR experiment was run 3 times independently from the same initialization and for each method we report its best performance measured by the smallest achievable test error. From the results in Figure 2, we conclude that all DOWNPOURbased methods achieve their best performance (test error) for small τ (τ ∈ {1, 4}), and become highly unstable for τ ∈ {16, 64}. While EAMSGD significantly outperforms comparator methods for all values of τ by having faster convergence. It also finds better-quality solution measured by the test error and this advantage becomes more significant for τ ∈ {16, 64}.

For the ImageNet experiment we report the results of one run with the best setting we have found. EASGD and EAMSGD were run with τ = 10 whereas DOWNPOUR and MDOWNPOUR were run with τ = 1. The results are in Figure 3 and 4. For the CIFAR experiment, it’s noticeable that the lowest achievable test error by either EASGD or EAMSGD decreases with larger p. This can potentially be explained by the fact that larger p allows for more exploration of the parameter space. In the Supplement, we discuss further the trade-off between exploration and exploitation as a function of the learning rate (section 9.5) and the communication period (section 9.6).

A new algorithm is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm accelerates the training of deep architectures compared to DOWNPOUR and other common baseline approaches and furthermore is very communication efficient.",
