      "text" : "Diffusion networks capture the underlying mechanism of how events propagate throughout a complex network. In marketing, social graph dynamics have caused large transformations in business models, forcing companies to re-imagine their customers not as a mass of isolated economic agents, but as customer networks [1]. In epidemiology, a precise understanding of spreading phenomena is heavily needed when trying to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. But whether the subject is a virus spreading across a computer network, an innovative product among early adopters, or a rumor propagating on a network of people, the questions of interest are the same: how many people will it infect? How fast will it spread? And, even more critically for decision makers: how can we modify its course in order to meet specific goals? Several papers tackled these issues by studying the influence maximization problem. Given a known diffusion process on a graph, it consists in finding the top-k subset of initial seeds with the highest expected number of infected nodes at a certain time distance T . This problem being NP-hard [2], various heuristics have been proposed in order to obtain scalable suboptimal approximations. While the first algorithms focused on discrete-time models and the special case T = +∞ [3, 4], subsequent papers [5, 6] brought empirical evidences of the key role played by temporal behavior. Existing models of continuous-time stochastic processes include multivariate Hawkes processes [7] where recent progress in inference methods [8, 9] made available the tools for the study of activity shaping [10], which is closely related to influence maximization. However, in the most studied case in which each node of the network can only be infected once, the most widely used model remains the Continuous-Time Information Cascade (CTIC) model [5]. Under this framework, successful inference [5] as well as influence maximization algorithms have been developed [11, 12].\nHowever, if recent works [13, 14] provided theoretical foundations for the inference problem, assessing the quality of influence maximization remains a challenging task, as few theoretical results exist for general graphs. In the infinite-time setting, studies of the SIR diffusion process in epidemiology [15] or percolation for specific graphs [16] provided a more accurate understanding of these processes. More recently, it was shown in [17] that the spectral radius of a given Hazard matrix\nplayed a key role in influence of information cascades. This allowed the authors to derive closedform tight bounds for the influence in general graphs and characterize epidemic thresholds under which the influence of any set of nodes is at most O( √ n).\nIn this paper, we extend their approach in order to deal with the problem of anytime influence bounds for continuous-time information cascades. More specifically, we define the Laplace Hazard matrices and show that the influence at time T of any set of nodes heavily depends on their spectral radii. Moreover, we reveal the existence and characterize the behavior of critical times at which supercritical processes explode. We show that before these times, super-critical processes will behave sub-critically and infect at most o(n) nodes. These results can be used in various ways. First, they provide a way to evaluate influence maximization algorithms without having to test all possible set of influencers, which is intractable for large graphs. Secondly, critical times allow decision makers to know how long a contagion will remain in its early phase before becoming a large-scale event, in fields where knowing when to act is nearly as important as knowing where to act. Finally, they can be seen as the first closed-form formula for anytime influence estimation for continuous-time information cascades. Indeed, we provide empirical evidence that our bounds are tight for a large family of graphs at the beginning and the end of the infection process.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definition of Information Cascades Model and introduce useful notations. In Section 3, we derive theoretical bounds for the influence. In Section 4, we illustrate our results by applying them on specific cascade models. In Section 5, we perform experiments in order to show that our bounds are sharp for a family of graphs and sets of initial nodes. All proof details are provided in the supplementary material."

We equip each directed edge (i, j) ∈ E with a time-varying probability distribution pij(t) over R+ ∪ {+∞} (pij is thus a sub-probability measure on R+) and define the cascade behavior as follows. At time t = 0, only a subset A ⊂ V of influencers is infected. Each node i infected at time τi may transmit the infection at time τi+ τij along its outgoing edge (i, j) ∈ E with probability density pij(τij), and independently of other transmission events. The process ends for a given T > 0.\nFor each node v ∈ V , we will denote as τv the (possibly infinite) time at which it is reached by the infection. The influence of A at time T , denoted as σA(T ), is defined as the expected number of nodes reached by the contagion at time T originating from A, i.e.\nσA(T ) = E[ ∑ v∈V 1{τv≤T}], (1)\nwhere the expectation is taken over cascades originating from A (i.e. τv = 0⇔ 1{v∈A}). Following the percolation literature, we will differentiate between sub-critical cascades whose size is o(n) and super-critical cascades whose size is proportional to n, where n denotes the size of the network. This work focuses on upper bounding the influence σA(T ) for any given time T and characterizing the critical times at which phase transitions occur between sub-critical and supercritical behaviors."

When ρ(0) ≥ 1, the long-term behavior may be super-critical and the influence may reach linear values in n. However, at a cost growing exponentially with T , it is always possible to choose a s such that ρ(s) < 1 and retrieve a O( √ n) behavior. While the exact optimal parameter s is in general not explicit, two choices of s derive relevant results: either simplifying esT by choosing s = 1/T , or keeping γ(s) sub-critical by choosing s s.t. ρ(s) < 1. In particular, the following corollary shows that the contagion explodes at most as eρ\n−1(1− )T for any ∈ [0, 1]. Corollary 2. Let ∈ [0, 1] and ρ(0) ≥ 1.

Since this section focuses on bounding σA(T ) for a given T ≥ 0, all the aforementioned results also hold for pTij(t) = pij(t)1{t≤T}.

      "text" : "The previous section presents results about how explosive a contagion is. These findings suggest that the speed at which a contagion explodes is bounded by a certain quantity, and thus that the process needs a certain amount of time to become super-critical.

This condition is not very restrictive, and is met for the different case studies considered in Section 4.\nThis result may be valuable for decision makers since it provides a safe time region in which the contagion has not reached a macroscopic scale. It thus provides insights into how long do decision makers have to prepare control measures. After T c, the process can explode and immediate action is required."

      "heading" : "4.3 SI and SIR epidemic models",
      "text" : "Both epidemic models SI and SIR are particular cases of exponential transmission probabilities. SIR model ([18]) is a widely used epidemic model that uses three states to describe the spread of an infection. Each node of the network can be either : susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (R). At\nt = 0, a subset A of n0 nodes is infected. Then, each node i infected at time τi is removed at an exponentially-distributed time θi of parameter δ. Transmission along its outgoing edge (i, j) ∈ E occurs at time τi + τij with conditional probability density β exp(−βτij), given that node i has not been removed at that time. When the removing events are not observed, SIR is equivalent to CTIC, except that transmission along outgoing edges of one node are positively correlated. However, our results still hold in case of such a correlation, as shown in the following result. Proposition 3. Assume the propagation follow a SIR model of transmission parameter β and removal parameter δ. Define pij(t) = β exp(−(δ + β)t) for (i, j) ∈ E . Let A = ( 1{(i,j)∈E} ) ij be the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected network. Then, results of Proposition 2 and subsequent corollaries still hold with ρ(s) given by:\nρ(s) = ρ\n( LH(s) + LH(s)>\n2\n) = ln ( 1 + β\nδ\n) δ + β\ns+ δ + β ρ(A) (17)\nFrom this proposition, the same analysis than in the independent transmission events case can be derived, and the critical time for the SIR model is\nT c ≥ lim inf n→+∞\nlnn\n2(δ + β)(ln(1 + βδ )ρ(A)− 1) . (18)\nProposition 4. Consider the SIR model with transmission rate β, recovery rate δ and adjacency matrix An. Assume lim infn→+∞ ln(1 + βδ )ρ(An) > 1, and the sequence (Tn)n∈N is such that\nlim sup n→+∞ 2(δ + β)(ln(1 + βδ )ρ(An)− 1)Tn lnn < 1. (19)\nThen, σA(Tn) = o(n). (20)\nThis is a direct corollary of Corollary 3 with ρ−1(1) = (δ + β)(ln(1 + βδ )ρ(An)− 1). The SI model is a simpler model in which individuals of the network remain infected and contagious through time (i.e. δ = 0). Thus, the network is totally infected at the end of the contagion and limn→+∞ σA(T ) = n. For this reason, the previous critical time for the more general SIR model is of no use here, and a more precise analysis is required. Following the remark of Section 3.1, we can integrate pij on [0, T ] instead of R+, which leads to the following result: Proposition 5. Consider the SI model with transmission rate β and adjacency matrix An. Assume lim infn→+∞ ρ(An) > 0 and the sequence (Tn)n∈N is such that\nlim sup n→+∞ βTn√ lnn 2ρ(An) (1− e − √ lnn 2ρ(An) ) < 1.

      "heading" : "5 Experimental results",
      "text" : "This section provides an experimental validation of our bounds, by comparing them to the empirical influence simulated on several network types. In all our experiments, we simulate a contagion with exponential transmission probabilities (see Section 4.2) on networks of size n = 1000 and generated random networks of 5 different types (for more information on the respective random generators, see e.g [20]): Erdös-Rényi networks, preferential attachment networks, small-world networks, geometric random networks ([21]) and totally connected networks with fixed weight b ∈ [0, 1] except for the ingoing and outgoing edges of a single node having, respectively, weight 0 and a > b. The reason for simulating on such totally connected networks is that the influence over these networks tend to match our upper bounds more closely, and plays the role of a best case\nscenario. More precisely, the transmission probabilities are of the form pij(t) = αe−t for each edge (i, j) ∈ E , where α ∈ [0, 1[ (and λ = 1 in the formulas of Section 4.2). We first investigate the tightness of the upper bound on the maximum influence given in Proposition 2. Figure 1 presents the empirical influence w.r.t. ρα = − ln(1 − α)ρ(A) (where A is the adjacency matrix of the network) for a large set of network types, as well as the upper bound in Proposition 2. Each point in the figure corresponds to the maximum influence on one network. The influence was averaged over 100 cascade simulations, and the best influencer (i.e. whose influence was maximal) was found by performing an exhaustive search. Our bounds are tight for all values of T ∈ {0.1, 1, 5, 100} for totally connected networks in the sub-critical regime (ρα < 1). For the super-critical regime (ρα > 1), the behavior in T is very instructive. For T ∈ {0.1, 5, 100}, we are tight for most network types when ρα is high. For T = 1 (the average transmission time for the (τij)(i,j)∈E ), the maximum influence varies a lot across different graphs. This follows the intuition that this is one of the times where, for a given final number of infected node, the local structure of the networks will play the largest role through precise temporal evolution of the infection. Because ρα explains quite well the final size of the infection, this discrepancy appears on our graphs at ρα fixed. While our bound does not seem tight for this particular time, the order of magnitude of the explosion time is retrieved and our bounds are close to optimal values as soon as T = 5.\nIn order to further validate that our bounds give meaningful insights on the critical time of explosion for super-critical graphs, Figure 2 presents the empirical influence with respect to the size of the network n for different network types and values of T , with ρα fixed to ρα = 4. In this setting, the critical time of Corollary 3 is given by T c∗ = lnn2(ρα−1)λ = 1.15. We see that our bounds are tight for totally connected networks for all values of T ∈ {0.2, 2, 5}. Moreover, the accuracy of critical time estimation is proved by the drastic change of behavior around T = T c∗, with phase transitions having occurred for most network types as soon as T = 5T c∗."

We introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion both in terms of influence and of explosion time. Using this concept, we prove tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, and we also provide an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical. Our contributions include formal definitions and tight lower bounds of critical explosion time. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results through several examples of information cascades used in epidemiology and viral marketing models. Finally, we provide a series of numerical experiments for various types of networks which confirm the tightness of the theoretical bounds.",
