      "text" : "Consider the problem of regret minimization in non-stochastic multi-armed bandits, as defined in the classic paper of Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, and Schapire [5]. This sequential decision-making problem can be formalized as a repeated game between a learner and an environment (sometimes called the adversary). In each round t = 1, 2, . . . , T , the two players interact as follows: The learner picks an arm (also called an action) It ∈ [K] = {1, 2, . . . ,K} and the environment selects a loss function `t : [K] → [0, 1], where the loss associated with arm i ∈ [K] is denoted as `t,i. Subsequently, the learner incurs and observes the loss `t,It . Based solely on these observations, the goal of the learner is to choose its actions so as to accumulate as little loss as possible during the course of the game. As traditional in the online learning literature [10], we measure the performance of the learner in terms of the regret defined as\nRT = T∑ t=1 `t,It − min i∈[K] T∑ t=1 `t,i.\nWe say that the environment is oblivious if it selects the sequence of loss vectors irrespective of the past actions taken by the learner, and adaptive (or non-oblivious) if it is allowed to choose `t as a function of the past actions It−1, . . . , I1. An equivalent formulation of the multi-armed bandit game uses the concept of rewards (also called gains or payoffs) instead of losses: in this version,\n∗The author is currently with the Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain.\nthe adversary chooses the sequence of reward functions (rt) with rt,i denoting the reward given to the learner for choosing action i in round t. In this game, the learner aims at maximizing its total rewards. We will refer to the above two formulations as the loss game and the reward game, respectively.\nOur goal in this paper is to construct algorithms for the learner that guarantee that the regret grows sublinearly. Since it is well known that no deterministic learning algorithm can achieve this goal [10], we are interested in randomized algorithms. Accordingly, the regret RT then becomes a random variable that we need to bound in some probabilistic sense. Most of the existing literature on non-stochastic bandits is concerned with bounding the pseudo-regret (or weak regret) defined as\nR̂T = max i∈[K]\nE [ T∑ t=1 `t,It − T∑ t=1 `t,i ] ,\nwhere the expectation integrates over the randomness injected by the learner. Proving bounds on the actual regret that hold with high probability is considered to be a significantly harder task that can be achieved by serious changes made to the learning algorithms and much more complicated analyses. One particular common belief is that in order to guarantee high-confidence performance guarantees, the learner cannot avoid repeatedly sampling arms from a uniform distribution, typically Ω (√ KT ) times [5, 4, 7, 9]. It is easy to see that such explicit exploration can impact the empirical performance of learning algorithms in a very negative way if there are many arms with high losses: even if the base learning algorithm quickly learns to focus on good arms, explicit exploration still forces the regret to grow at a steady rate. As a result, algorithms with high-probability performance guarantees tend to perform poorly even in very simple problems [25, 7].\nIn the current paper, we propose an algorithm that guarantees strong regret bounds that hold with high probability without the explicit exploration component. One component that we preserve from the classical recipe for such algorithms is the biased estimation of losses, although our bias is of a much more delicate nature, and arguably more elegant than previous approaches. In particular, we adopt the implicit exploration (IX) strategy first proposed by Kocák, Neu, Valko, and Munos [19] for the problem of online learning with side-observations. As we show in the current paper, this simple loss-estimation strategy allows proving high-probability bounds for a range of nonstochastic bandit problems including bandits with expert advice, tracking the best arm and bandits with side-observations. Our proofs are arguably cleaner and less involved than previous ones, and very elementary in the sense that they do not rely on advanced results from probability theory like Freedman’s inequality [12]. The resulting bounds are tighter than all previously known bounds and hold simultaneously for all confidence levels, unlike most previously known bounds [5, 7]. For the first time in the literature, we also provide high-probability bounds for anytime algorithms that do not require prior knowledge of the time horizon T . A minor conceptual improvement in our analysis is a direct treatment of the loss game, as opposed to previous analyses that focused on the reward game, making our treatment more coherent with other state-of-the-art results in the online learning literature1.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the known techniques for proving high-probability regret bounds for non-stochastic bandits and describe our implicit exploration strategy in precise terms. Section 3 states our main result concerning the concentration of the IX loss estimates and shows applications of this result to several problem settings. Finally, we conduct a set of simple experiments to illustrate the benefits of implicit exploration over previous techniques in Section 4."

      "text" : "Most principled learning algorithms for the non-stochastic bandit problem are constructed by using a standard online learning algorithm such as the exponentially weighted forecaster ([26, 20, 13]) or follow the perturbed leader ([14, 18]) as a black box, with the true (unobserved) losses replaced by some appropriate estimates. One of the key challenges is constructing reliable estimates of the losses `t,i for all i ∈ [K] based on the single observation `t,It . Following Auer et al. [5], this is\n1In fact, studying the loss game is colloquially known to allow better constant factors in the bounds in many settings (see, e.g., Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi [9]). Our result further reinforces these observations.\ntraditionally achieved by using importance-weighted loss/reward estimates of the form\n̂̀ t,i =\n`t,i pt,i I{It=i} or r̂t,i = rt,i pt,i I{It=i} (1)\nwhere pt,i = P [It = i| Ft−1] is the probability that the learner picks action i in round t, conditioned on the observation history Ft−1 of the learner up to the beginning of round t. It is easy to show that these estimates are unbiased for all i with pt,i > 0 in the sense that Ềt,i = `t,i for all such i. For concreteness, consider the EXP3 algorithm of Auer et al. [5] as described in Bubeck and CesaBianchi [9, Section 3]. In every round t, this algorithm uses the loss estimates defined in Equation (1) to compute the weights wt,i = exp ( −η ∑t−1 s=1 ̂̀ s−1,i ) for all i and some positive parameter η that is often called the learning rate. Having computed these weights, EXP3 draws arm It = i with probability proportional to wt,i. Relying on the unbiasedness of the estimates (1) and an optimized setting of η, one can prove that EXP3 enjoys a pseudo-regret bound of √ 2TK logK. However, the fluctuations of the loss estimates around the true losses are too large to permit bounding the true regret with high probability. To keep these fluctuations under control, Auer et al. [5] propose to use the biased reward-estimates\nr̃t,i = r̂t,i + β\npt,i (2)\nwith an appropriately chosen β > 0. Given these estimates, the EXP3.P algorithm of Auer et al. [5] computes the weights wt,i = exp ( η ∑t−1 s=1 r̃s,i ) for all arms i and then samples It according to the distribution pt,i = (1− γ)\nwt,i∑K j=1 wt,j + γ K ,\nwhere γ ∈ [0, 1] is the exploration parameter. The argument for this explicit exploration is that it helps to keep the range (and thus the variance) of the above reward estimates bounded, thus enabling the use of (more or less) standard concentration results2. In particular, the key element in the analysis of EXP3.P [5, 9, 7, 6] is showing that the inequality\nT∑ t=1 (rt,i − r̃t,i) ≤ log(K/δ) β\nholds simultaneously for all i with probability at least 1 − δ. In other words, this shows that the cumulative estimates ∑T t=1 r̃t,i are upper confidence bounds for the true rewards ∑T t=1 rt,i.\nIn the current paper, we propose to use the loss estimates defined as\n˜̀ t,i =\n`t,i pt,i + γt I{It=i}, (3)\nfor all i and an appropriately chosen γt > 0, and then use the resulting estimates in an exponentialweights algorithm scheme without any explicit exploration. Loss estimates of this form were first used by Kocák et al. [19]—following them, we refer to this technique as Implicit eXploration, or, in short, IX. In what follows, we argue that that IX as defined above achieves a similar variancereducing effect as the one achieved by the combination of explicit exploration and the biased reward estimates of Equation (2). In particular, we show that the IX estimates (3) constitute a lower confidence bound for the true losses which allows proving high-probability bounds for a number of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem."

      "text" : "In this section, we present a concentration result concerning the IX loss estimates of Equation (3), and apply this result to prove high-probability performance guarantees for a number of nonstochastic bandit problems. The following lemma states our concentration result in its most general form:\n2Explicit exploration is believed to be inevitable for proving bounds in the reward game for various other reasons, too—see Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi [9] for a discussion.\nLemma 1. Let (γt) be a fixed non-increasing sequence with γt ≥ 0 and let αt,i be nonnegative Ft−1-measurable random variables satisfying αt,i ≤ 2γt for all t and i. Then, with probability at least 1− δ,\nT∑ t=1 K∑ i=1 αt,i (˜̀ t,i − `t,i ) ≤ log (1/δ) .\nA particularly important special case of the above lemma is the following: Corollary 1. Let γt = γ ≥ 0 for all t. With probability at least 1− δ,\nT∑ t=1 (˜̀ t,i − `t,i ) ≤ log (K/δ) 2γ .\nsimultaneously holds for all i ∈ [K].\nThis corollary follows from applying Lemma 1 to the functions αt,i = 2γI{i=j} for all j and applying the union bound. The full proof of Lemma 1 is presented in the Appendix. For didactic purposes, we now present a direct proof for Corollary 1, which is essentially a simpler version of Lemma 1.\nProof of Corollary 1. For convenience, we will use the notation β = 2γ. First, observe that\n˜̀ t,i =\n`t,i pt,i + γ I{It=i} ≤ `t,i pt,i + γ`t,i I{It=i} = 1 2γ · 2γ`t,i/pt,i 1 + γ`t,i/pt,i I{It=i} ≤ 1 β · log\n( 1 + β ̂̀t,i) ,\nwhere the first step follows from `t,i ∈ [0, 1] and last one from the elementary inequality z1+z/2 ≤ log(1 + z) that holds for all z ≥ 0. Using the above inequality, we get that\nE [ exp ( β ˜̀t,i)∣∣∣Ft−1] ≤E [1 + β ̂̀t,i∣∣∣Ft−1] ≤ 1 + β`t,i ≤ exp (β`t,i) ,\nwhere the second and third steps are obtained by using E [ ̂̀ t,i ∣∣∣Ft−1] ≤ `t,i that holds by definition of ̂̀t,i, and the inequality 1 + z ≤ ez that holds for all z ∈ R. As a result, the process Zt = exp ( β ∑t s=1 (˜̀ s,i− `s,i )) is a supermartingale with respect to (Ft): E [Zt| Ft−1] ≤ Zt−1. Observe that, since Z0 = 1, this implies E [ZT ] ≤ E [ZT−1] ≤ . . . ≤ 1, and thus by Markov’s inequality,\nP [ T∑ t=1 (˜̀ t,i − `t,i ) > ε ] ≤ E [ exp ( β T∑ t=1 (˜̀ t,i − `t,i ))] · exp(−βε) ≤ exp(−βε)\nholds for any ε > 0. The statement of the lemma follows from solving exp(−βε) = δ/K for ε and using the union bound over all arms i.\nIn what follows, we put Lemma 1 to use and prove improved high-probability performance guarantees for several well-studied variants of the non-stochastic bandit problem, namely, the multi-armed bandit problem with expert advice, tracking the best arm for multi-armed bandits, and bandits with side-observations. The general form of Lemma 1 will allow us to prove high-probability bounds for anytime algorithms that can operate without prior knowledge of T . For clarity, we will only provide such bounds for the standard multi-armed bandit setting; extending the derivations to other settings is left as an easy exercise. For all algorithms, we prove bounds that scale linearly with log(1/δ) and hold simultaneously for all levels δ. Note that this dependence can be improved to √ log(1/δ) for a fixed confidence level δ, if the algorithm can use this δ to tune its parameters. This is the way that Table 1 presents our new bounds side-by-side with the best previously known ones.\n3.1 Multi-armed bandits\nAlgorithm 1 EXP3-IX Parameters: η > 0, γ > 0.

[5] that uses the IX loss estimates (3): EXP3-IX. The algorithm in its most general form uses two nonincreasing sequences of nonnegative parameters: (ηt) and (γt). In every round, EXP3-IX chooses action It = i with probability proportional to\npt,i ∝ wt,i = exp ( −ηt\nt−1∑ s=1 ˜̀ s,i\n) , (4)\nwithout mixing any explicit exploration term into the distribution. A fixed-parameter version of EXP3-IX is presented as Algorithm 1.\nOur theorem below states a high-probability bound on the regret of EXP3-IX. Notably, our bound exhibits the best known constant factor of 2 √ 2 in the leading term, improving on the factor of 5.15 due to Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi [9]. The best known leading constant for the pseudo-regret bound of EXP3 is √ 2, also proved in Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi [9].\nTheorem 1. Fix an arbitrary δ > 0. With ηt = 2γt = √ 2 logK KT for all t, EXP3-IX guarantees\nRT ≤ 2 √ 2KT logK +\n(√ 2KT\nlogK + 1\n) log (2/δ)\nwith probability at least 1−δ. Furthermore, setting ηt = 2γt = √ logK Kt for all t, the bound becomes\nRT ≤ 4 √ KT logK + ( 2 √ KT\nlogK + 1\n) log (2/δ) .\nProof. Let us fix an arbitrary δ′ ∈ (0, 1). Following the standard analysis of EXP3 in the loss game and nonincreasing learning rates [9], we can obtain the bound\nT∑ t=1 ( K∑ i=1 pt,i ˜̀t,i − ˜̀t,j) ≤ logK ηT + T∑ t=1 ηt 2 K∑ i=1 pt,i (˜̀ t,i )2 for any j. Now observe that\nK∑ i=1 pt,i ˜̀t,i = K∑ i=1 I{It=i} `t,i (pt,i + γt) pt,i + γt − γt K∑ i=1 I{It=i} `t,i pt,i + γt`t,i = `t,It − γt K∑ i=1 ˜̀ t,i. (5)\nSimilarly, ∑K i=1 pt,i ˜̀2 t,i ≤ ∑K i=1 ˜̀ t,i holds by the boundedness of the losses. Thus, we get that\nT∑ t=1 (`t,It − `t,j) ≤ T∑ t=1 ( `t,j − ˜̀t,j)+ logK ηT + T∑ t=1 (ηt 2 + γt ) K∑ i=1 ˜̀ t,i\n≤ log (K/δ ′)\n2γ +\nlogK\nη + T∑ t=1 (ηt 2 + γt ) K∑ i=1 `t,i + log (1/δ ′)\nholds with probability at least 1 − 2δ′, where the last line follows from an application of Lemma 1 with αt,i = ηt/2 + γt for all t, i and taking the union bound. By taking j = arg mini LT,i and δ′ = δ/2, and using the boundedness of the losses, we obtain\nRT ≤ log (2K/δ)\n2γT +\nlogK\nηT +K T∑ t=1 (ηt 2 + γt ) + log (2/δ) .\nThe statements of the theorem then follow immediately, noting that ∑T t=1 1/ √ t ≤ 2 √ T ."

In this setting, we assume that in every round t = 1, 2, . . . , T , the learner observes a set of N probability distributions ξt(1), ξt(2), . . . , ξt(N) ∈ [0, 1]K over the K arms, such that ∑K i=1 ξt,i(n) = 1 for all n ∈ [N ].

[1]. In this setting, the learner and the environment interact exactly as in the multi-armed bandit problem, the main difference being that in every round, the learner observes the losses of some arms other than its actually chosen arm It. The structure of the side observations is described by the directed graph G: nodes of G correspond to individual arms, and the presence of arc i→ j implies that the learner will observe `t,j upon selecting It = i.\nImplicit exploration and EXP3-IX was first proposed by Kocák et al.

In contrast, the only high-probability regret bound for this setting due to Alon et al.

      "text" : "We conduct a simple experiment to demonstrate the robustness of EXP3-IX as compared to EXP3 and its superior performance as compared to EXP3.P. Our setting is a 10-arm bandit problem where all losses are independent draws of Bernoulli random variables. The mean losses of arms 1 through 8 are 1/2 and the mean loss of arm 9 is 1/2−∆ for all rounds t = 1, 2, . . . , T . The mean losses of arm 10 are changing over time: for rounds t ≤ T/2, the mean is 1/2+ ∆, and 1/2−4∆ afterwards. This choice ensures that up to at least round T/2, arm 9 is clearly better than other arms. In the second half of the game, arm 10 starts to outperform arm 9 and eventually becomes the leader.\nWe have evaluated the performance of EXP3, EXP3.P and EXP3-IX in the above setting with T = 106 and ∆ = 0.1. For fairness of comparison, we evaluate all three algorithms for a wide range of parameters. In particular, for all three algorithms, we set a base learning rate η according to the best known theoretical results [9, Theorems 3.1 and 3.3] and varied the multiplier of the respective base parameters between 0.01 and 100. Other parameters are set as γ = η/2 for EXP3-IX and β = γ/K = η for EXP3.P. We studied the regret up to two interesting rounds in the game: up to T/2, where the losses are i.i.d., and up to T where the algorithms have to notice the shift in the\nloss distributions. Figure 1 shows the empirical means and standard deviations over 50 runs of the regrets of the three algorithms as a function of the multipliers. The results clearly show that EXP3IX largely improves on the empirical performance of EXP3.P and is also much more robust in the non-stochastic regime than vanilla EXP3."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we have shown that, contrary to popular belief, explicit exploration is not necessary to achieve high-probability regret bounds for non-stochastic bandit problems. Interestingly, however, we have observed in several of our experiments that our IX-based algorithms still draw every arm roughly √ T times, even though this is not explicitly enforced by the algorithm. This suggests a need for a more complete study of the role of exploration, to find out whether pulling every single arm Ω( √ T ) times is necessary for achieving near-optimal guarantees.\nOne can argue that tuning the IX parameter that we introduce may actually be just as difficult in practice as tuning the parameters of EXP3.P. However, every aspect of our analysis suggests that γt = ηt/2 is the most natural choice for these parameters, and thus this is the choice that we recommend. One limitation of our current analysis is that it only permits deterministic learning-rate and IX parameters (see the conditions of Lemma 1). That is, proving adaptive regret bounds in the vein of [15, 24, 23] that hold with high probability is still an open challenge.\nAnother interesting direction for future work is whether the implicit exploration approach can help in advancing the state of the art in the more general setting of linear bandits. All known algorithms for this setting rely on explicit exploration techniques, and the strength of the obtained results depend crucially on the choice of the exploration distribution (see [8, 16] for recent advances). Interestingly, IX has a natural extension to the linear bandit problem. To see this, consider the vector Vt = eIt and the matrix Pt = E [VtV Tt ]. Then, the IX loss estimates can be written as ˜̀t = (Pt + γI)−1VtV Tt `t. Whether or not this estimate is the right choice for linear bandits remains to be seen.\nFinally, we note that our estimates (3) are certainly not the only ones that allow avoiding explicit exploration. In fact, the careful reader might deduce from the proof of Lemma 1 that the same concentration can be shown to hold for the alternative loss estimates `t,iI{It=i}/ (pt,i + γ`t,i) and log ( 1 + 2γ`t,iI{It=i}/pt,i ) /(2γ). Actually, a variant of the latter estimate was used previously for proving high-probability regret bounds in the reward game by Audibert and Bubeck [4]—however, their proof still relied on explicit exploration. It is not hard to verify that all the results we presented in this paper (except Theorem 4) can be shown to hold for the above two estimates, too.\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by INRIA, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and by FUI project Hermès.

Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least Ω( √ T ) times over T rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit eXploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework. Finally, we conduct a simple experiment that illustrates the robustness of our implicit exploration technique.",
