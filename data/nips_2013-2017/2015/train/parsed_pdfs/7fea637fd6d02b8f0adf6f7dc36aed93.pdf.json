      "text" : "What happens when players in a game interact with one another, all of them acting independently and selfishly to maximize their own utilities? If they are smart, we intuitively expect their utilities — both individually and as a group — to grow, perhaps even to approach the best possible. We also expect the dynamics of their behavior to eventually reach some kind of equilibrium. Understanding these dynamics is central to game theory as well as its various application areas, including economics, network routing, auction design, and evolutionary biology.\nIt is natural in this setting for the players to each make use of a no-regret learning algorithm for making their decisions, an approach known as decentralized no-regret dynamics. No-regret algorithms are a strong match for playing games because their regret bounds hold even in adversarial environments. As a benefit, these bounds ensure that each player’s utility approaches optimality. When played against one another, it can also be shown that the sum of utilities approaches an approximate optimum [2, 18], and the player strategies converge to an equilibrium under appropriate conditions [6, 1, 8], at rates governed by the regret bounds. Well-known families of no-regret algorithms include multiplicative-weights [13, 7], Mirror Descent [14], and Follow the Regularized/Perturbed Leader [12]. (See [3, 19] for excellent overviews.) For all of these, the average regret vanishes at the worst-case rate of O(1/ p T ), which is unimprovable in fully adversarial scenarios.\nHowever, the players in our setting are facing other similar, predictable no-regret learning algorithms, a chink that hints at the possibility of improved convergence rates for such dynamics. This was first observed and exploited by Daskalakis et al. [4]. For two-player zero-sum games, they developed a decentralized variant of Nesterov’s accelerated saddle point algorithm [15] and showed that each player’s average regret converges at the remarkable rate of O(1/T ). Although the resulting\ndynamics are somewhat unnatural, in later work, Rakhlin and Sridharan [17] showed surprisingly that the same convergence rate holds for a simple variant of Mirror Descent with the seemingly minor modification that the last utility observation is counted twice.\nAlthough major steps forward, both these works are limited to two-player zero-sum games, the very simplest case. As such, they do not cover many practically important settings, such as auctions or routing games, which are decidedly not zero-sum, and which involve many independent actors.\nIn this paper, we vastly generalize these techniques to the practically important but far more challenging case of arbitrary multi-player normal-form games, giving natural no-regret dynamics whose convergence rates are much faster than previously possible for this general setting.\nContributions. We show that the average welfare of the game, that is, the sum of player utilities, converges to approximately optimal welfare at the rate O(1/T ), rather than the previously known rate of O(1/ p T ). Concretely, we show a natural class of regularized no-regret algorithms with recency bias that achieve welfare at least ( /(1 + µ))OPT O(1/T ), where and µ are parameters in a smoothness condition on the game introduced by Roughgarden [18]. For the same class of algorithms, we show that each individual player’s average regret converges to zero at the rate O T 3/4\n. Thus, our results entail an algorithm for computing coarse correlated equilibria in a decentralized manner with significantly faster convergence than existing methods.\nWe additionally give a black-box reduction that preserves the fast rates in favorable environments, while robustly maintaining ˜O(1/ p T ) regret against any opponent in the worst case.\nEven for two-person zero-sum games, our results for general games expose a hidden generality and modularity underlying the previous results [4, 17]. First, our analysis identifies stability and recency bias as key structural ingredients of an algorithm with fast rates. This covers the Optimistic Mirror Descent of Rakhlin and Sridharan [17] as an example, but also applies to optimistic variants of Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL), including dependence on arbitrary weighted windows in the history as opposed to just the utility from the last round. Recency bias is a behavioral pattern commonly observed in game-theoretic environments [9]; as such, our results can be viewed as a partial theoretical justification. Second, previous approaches in [4, 17] on achieving both faster convergence against similar algorithms while at the same time ˜O(1/ p T ) regret rates against adversaries were shown via ad-hoc modifications of specific algorithms. We give a black-box modification which is not algorithm specific and works for all these optimistic algorithms.\nFinally, we simulate a 4-bidder simultaneous auction game, and compare our optimistic algorithms against Hedge [7] in terms of utilities, regrets and convergence to equilibria."

      "text" : "Consider a static game G among a set N of n players. Each player i has a strategy space Si and a utility function ui : S1 ⇥ . . .⇥ Sn ! [0, 1] that maps a strategy profile s = (s1, . . . , sn) to a utility ui(s). We assume that the strategy space of each player is finite and has cardinality d, i.e. |Si| = d. We denote with w = (w\n1 , . . . ,wn) a profile of mixed strategies, where wi 2 (Si) and wi,x is the probability of strategy x 2 Si. Finally let Ui(w) = Es⇠w[ui(s)], the expected utility of player i. We consider the setting where the game G is played repeatedly for T time steps. At each time step t each player i picks a mixed strategy wti 2 (Si). At the end of the iteration each player i observes the expected utility he would have received had he played any possible strategy x 2 Si. More formally, let uti,x = Es i⇠wt i [ui(x, s i)], where s i is the set of strategies of all but the i th player, and let uti = (uti,x)x2Si . At the end of each iteration each player i observes uti. Observe that the expected utility of a player at iteration t is simply the inner product hwti ,utii.\nNo-regret dynamics. We assume that the players each decide their strategy wti based on a vanishing regret algorithm. Formally, for each player i, the regret after T time steps is equal to the maximum gain he could have achieved by switching to any other fixed strategy:\nri(T ) = sup w⇤i 2 (Si)\nT X\nt=1\n⌦ w⇤i wti ,uti ↵ .\nThe algorithm has vanishing regret if ri(T ) = o(T ).\nApproximate Efficiency of No-Regret Dynamics. We are interested in analyzing the average welfare of such vanishing regret sequences. For a given strategy profile s the social welfare is defined as the sum of the player utilities: W (s) = P\ni2N ui(s). We overload notation to denote W (w) = Es⇠w[W (s)]. We want to lower bound how far the average welfare of the sequence is, with respect to the optimal welfare of the static game:\nOPT = max s2S1⇥...⇥Sn W (s).\nThis is the optimal welfare achievable in the absence of player incentives and if a central coordinator could dictate each player’s strategy. We next define a class of games first identified by Roughgarden [18] on which we can approximate the optimal welfare using decoupled no-regret dynamics.\nDefinition 1 (Smooth game [18]). A game is ( , µ)-smooth if there exists a strategy profile s⇤ such that for any strategy profile s: P\ni2N ui(s ⇤ i , s i) OPT µW (s).\nIn words, any player using his optimal strategy continues to do well irrespective of other players’ strategies. This condition directly implies near-optimality of no-regret dynamics as we show below.\nProposition 2. In a ( , µ)-smooth game, if each player i suffers regret at most ri(T ), then:\n1\nT\nT X\nt=1\nW (wt) 1 + µ OPT 1 1 + µ 1 T\nX i2N ri(T ) = 1 ⇢ OPT 1 1 + µ 1 T X i2N ri(T ),\nwhere the factor ⇢ = (1 + µ)/ is called the price of anarchy (POA).\nThis proposition is essentially a more explicit version of Roughgarden’s result [18]; we provide a proof in the appendix for completeness. The result shows that the convergence to POA is driven by the quantity 1\n1+µ 1 T\nP\ni2N ri(T ). There are many algorithms which achieve a regret rate of ri(T ) = O( p\nlog(d)T ), in which case the latter theorem would imply that the average welfare converges to POA at a rate of O(n p\nlog(d)/T ). As we will show, for some natural classes of no-regret algorithms the average welfare converges at the much faster rate of O(n2 log(d)/T )."

      "text" : "So far we have shown simple dynamics with rapid convergence properties in favorable environments when each player in the game uses an algorithm with the RVU property. It is natural to wonder if this comes at the cost of worst-case guarantees when some players do not use algorithms with this property. Rakhlin and Sridharan [17] address this concern by modifying the OMD algorithm with additional smoothing and adaptive step-sizes so as to preserve the fast rates in the favorable case while still guaranteeing O(1/ p T ) regret for each player, no matter how the opponents play. It is not so obvious how this modification might extend to other procedures, and it seems undesirable to abandon the black-box regret transformations we used to obtain Theorem 4. In this section, we present a generic way of transforming an algorithm which satisfies the RVU property so that it retains the fast convergence in favorable settings, but always guarantees a worst-case regret of ˜O(1/ p T ).\nIn order to present our modification, we need a parametric form of the RVU property which will also involve a tunable parameter of the algorithm. For most online learning algorithms, this will correspond to the step-size parameter used by the algorithm. Definition 13 (RVU(⇢) property).

Algorithm A0, with ⌘⇤ = (2+ )(n 1)2 log(T ) , achieves regret ˜O( p T ) against any adversarial sequence, while at the same time satisfying the conditions of Theorem 4.

Setting ⌘⇤ = (2+ )(n 1)2 =\n1 12(n 1)2 , the resulting algorithm A0 will have regret at most: ˜O(n2 p T ) against an arbitrary adversary, while if all players use algorithm A0 then P\ni2N ri(T ) = O(n 3 log(T )).\nAn analogue of Theorem 11 can also be established for this algorithm: Corollary 16.

The game is defined as follows: simultaneously each player picks one of the m items and submits a bid on that item (we assume bids to be discretized). For each item, the highest bidder wins and pays his bid. We let players play this game repeatedly with each player invoking either Hedge or optimistic Hedge. This game, and generalizations of it, are known to be (1 1/e, 0)-smooth [20], if we also view the auctioneer as a player whose utility is the revenue. The welfare of the game is the value of the resulting allocation, hence not a constant-sum game. The welfare maximization problem corresponds to the unweighted bipartite matching problem. The POA captures how far from the optimal matching is the average allocation of the dynamics. By smoothness we know it converges to at least 1 1/e of the optimal.\nFast convergence of individual and average regret. We run the game for n = 4 bidders and m = 4 items and valuation v = 20. The bids are discretized to be any integer in [1, 20]. We find that the sum of the regrets and the maximum individual regret of each player are remarkably lower under Optimistic Hedge as opposed to Hedge. In Figure 1 we plot the maximum individual regret as well as the sum of the regrets under the two algorithms, using ⌘ = 0.1 for both methods.

We also observe similar behavior when each player only has value on a randomly picked player-specific subset of items, or uses other step sizes.\nMore stable dynamics. We observe that the behavior under Optimistic Hedge is more stable than under Hedge. In Figure 2, we plot the expected bid of a player on one of the items and his expected utility under the two dynamics. Hedge exhibits the sawtooth behavior that was observed in generalized first price auction run by Overture (see [5, p. 21]). In stunning contrast, Optimistic Hedge leads to more stable expected bids over time. This stability property of optimistic Hedge is one of the main intuitive reasons for the fast convergence of its regret.\nWelfare. In this class of games, we did not observe any significant difference between the average welfare of the methods. The key reason is the following: the proof that no-regret dynamics are approximately efficient (Proposition 2) only relies on the fact that each player does not have regret against the strategy s⇤i used in the definition of a smooth game. In this game, regret against these strategies is experimentally comparable under both algorithms, even though regret against the best fixed strategy is remarkably different. This indicates a possibility for faster rates for Hedge in terms of welfare. In Appendix H, we show fast convergence of the efficiency of Hedge for costminimization games, though with a worse POA ."
