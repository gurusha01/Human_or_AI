      "text" : "The goal of disease progression modeling is to learn a model for the temporal evolution of a disease from sequences of clinical measurements obtained from a longitudinal sample of patients. By distilling population data into a compact representation, disease progression models can yield insights into the disease process through the visualization and analysis of disease trajectories. In addition, the models can be used to predict the future course of disease in an individual, supporting the development of individualized treatment schedules and improved treatment efficiencies. Furthermore, progression models can support phenotyping by providing a natural similarity measure between trajectories which can be used to group patients based on their progression.\nHidden variable models are particularly attractive for modeling disease progression for three reasons: 1) they support the abstraction of a disease state via the latent variables; 2) they can deal with noisy measurements effectively; and 3) they can easily incorporate dynamical priors and constraints. While conventional hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used to model disease progression, they are not suitable in general because they assume that measurement data is sampled regularly at discrete intervals. However, in reality patient visits are irregular in time, as a consequence of scheduling issues, missed visits, and changes in symptomatology.\nA Continuous-Time HMM (CT-HMM) is an HMM in which both the transitions between hidden states and the arrival of observations can occur at arbitrary (continuous) times [1, 2]. It is therefore suitable for irregularly-sampled temporal data such as clinical measurements [3, 4, 5]. Unfortunately, the additional modeling flexibility provided by CT-HMM comes at the cost of a more complex inference procedure. In CT-HMM, not only are the hidden states unobserved, but the transition times at which the hidden states are changing are also unobserved. Moreover, multiple unobserved hidden state transitions can occur between two successive observations. A previous method addressed these challenges by directly maximizing the data likelihood [2], but this approach is limited\nto very small model sizes. A general EM framework for continuous-time dynamic Bayesian networks, of which CT-HMM is a special case, was introduced in [6], but that work did not address the question of efficient learning. Consequently, there is a need for efficient CT-HMM learning methods that can scale to large state spaces (e.g. hundreds of states or more) [7].\nA key aspect of our approach is to leverage the existing literature for continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) models [8, 9, 10]. These models assume that states are directly observable, but retain the irregular distribution of state transition times. EM approaches to CTMC learning compute the expected state durations and transition counts conditioned on each pair of successive observations. The key computation is the evaluation of integrals of the matrix exponential (Eqs. 12 and 13). Prior work by Wang et. al. [5] used a closed form estimator due to [8] which assumes that the transition rate matrix can be diagonalized through an eigendecomposition. Unfortunately, this is frequently not achievable in practice, limiting the usefulness of the approach. We explore two additional CTMC approaches [9] which use (1) an alternative matrix exponential on an auxillary matrix (Expm method); and (2) a direct truncation of the infinite sum expansion of the exponential (Unif method). Neither of these approaches have been previously exploited for CT-HMM learning.\nWe present the first comprehensive framework for efficient EM-based parameter learning in CTHMM, which both extends and unifies prior work on CTMC models. We show that a CT-HMM can be conceptualized as a time-inhomogenous HMM which yields posterior state distributions at the observation times, coupled with CTMCs that govern the distribution of hidden state transitions between observations (Eqs. 9 and 10). We explore both soft (forward-backward) and hard (Viterbi decoding) approaches to estimating the posterior state distributions, in combination with three methods for calculating the conditional expectations. We validate these methods in simulation and evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets for glaucoma and Alzheimer’s disease, including visualizations of the progression model and predictions of future progression. Our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art method [11] for glaucoma prediction, which demonstrates the practical utility of CT-HMM for clinical data modeling."

      "heading" : "2 Continuous-Time Markov Chain",
      "text" : "A continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is defined by a finite and discrete state space S, a state transition rate matrixQ, and an initial state probability distribution π. The elements qij inQ describe the rate the process transitions from state i to j for i 6= j, and qii are specified such that each row of Q sums to zero (qi = ∑ j 6=i qij , qii = −qi) [1]. In a time-homogeneous process, in which the qij are independent of t, the sojourn time in each state i is exponentially-distributed with parameter qi, which is f(t) = qie−qit with mean 1/qi. The probability that the process’s next move from state i is to state j is qij/qi. When a realization of the CTMC is fully observed, meaning that one can observe every transition time (t′0, t ′ 1, . . . , t ′ V ′), and the corresponding state Y\n′ = {y0 = s(t′0), ..., yV ′ = s(t′V ′)}, where s(t) denotes the state at time t, the complete likelihood (CL) of the data is\nCL = V ′−1∏ v′=0 (qyv′ ,yv′+1/qyv′ )(qyv′ e −qy v′ τv′ ) = V ′−1∏ v′=0 qyv′ ,yv′+1e −qy v′ τv′ = |S|∏ i=1 |S|∏ j=1,j 6=i q nij ij e −qiτi (1)\nwhere τv′ = t′v′+1− t′v′ is the time interval between two transitions, nij is the number of transitions from state i to j, and τi is the total amount of time the chain remains in state i.\nIn general, a realization of the CTMC is observed only at discrete and irregular time points (t0, t1, ..., tV ), corresponding to a state sequence Y , which are distinct from the switching times. As a result, the Markov process between two consecutive observations is hidden, with potentially many unobserved state transitions. Thus both nij and τi are unobserved. In order to express the likelihood of the incomplete observations, we can utilize a discrete time hidden Markov model by defining a state transition probability matrix for each distinct time interval t, P (t) = eQt, where Pij(t), the entry (i, j) in P (t), is the probability that the process is in state j after time t given that it is in state i at time 0. This quantity takes into account all possible intermediate state transitions and timing between i and j which are not observed. Then the likelihood of the data is\nL = V−1∏ v=0 Pyv,yv+1(τv) = V−1∏ v=0 |S|∏ i,j=1 Pij(τv) I(yv=i,yv+1=j) = r∏ ∆=1 |S|∏ i,j=1 Pij(τ∆) C(τ=τ∆,yv=i,yv+1=j) (2)\nwhere τv = tv+1 − tv is the time interval between two observations, I(yv = i, yv+1 = j) is an indicator function that is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise it is 0, τ∆, ∆ = 1, ..., r, represents r unique values among all time intervals τv , and C(τ = τ∆, yv = i, yv+1 = j) is the total counts\nfrom all successive visits when the condition is true. Note that there is no analytic maximizer of L, due to the structure of the matrix exponential, and direct numerical maximization with respect to Q is computationally challenging. This motivates the use of an EM-based approach.\nAn EM algorithm for CTMC is described in [8]. Based on Eq. 1, the expected complete log likelihood takes the form ∑|S| i=1 ∑|S| j=1,j 6=i{log(qij)E[nij |Y, Q̂0]−qiE[τi|Y, Q̂0]}, where Q̂0 is the current estimate for Q, and E[nij |Y, Q̂0] and E[τi|Y, Q̂0] are the expected state transition count and total duration given the incomplete observation Y and the current transition rate matrix Q̂0, respectively. Once these two expectations are computed in the E-step, the updated Q̂ parameters can be obtained via the M-step as\nq̂ij = E[nij |Y, Q̂0] E[τi|Y, Q̂0] , i 6= j and q̂ii = − ∑ j 6=i q̂ij . (3)\nNow the main computational challenge is to evaluate E[nij |Y, Q̂0] and E[τi|Y, Q̂0]. By exploiting the properties of the Markov process, the two expectations can be decomposed as [12]:\nE[nij |Y, Q̂0] = V−1∑ v=0 E[nij |yv, yv+1, Q̂0] = V−1∑ v=0 |S|∑ k,l=1 I(yv = k, yv+1 = l)E[nij |yv = k, yv+1 = l, Q̂0] E[τi|Y, Q̂0] = V−1∑ v=0 E[τi|yv, yv+1, Q̂0] = V−1∑ v=0 |S|∑ k,l=1 I(yv = k, yv+1 = l)E[τi|yv = k, yv+1 = l, Q̂0]\nwhere I(yv = k, yv+1 = l) = 1 if the condition is true, otherwise it is 0. Thus, the computation reduces to computing the end-state conditioned expectations E[nij |yv = k, yv+1 = l, Q̂0] and E[τi|yv = k, yv+1 = l, Q̂0], for all k, l, i, j ∈ S. These expectations are also a key step in CT-HMM learning, and Section 4 presents our approach to computing them."

      "text" : "In contrast to CTMC, where the states are directly observed, none of the states are directly observed in CT-HMM. Instead, the available observational data o depends on the hidden states s via the measurement model p(o|s). In contrast to a conventional HMM, the observations (o0, o1, . . . , oV ) are only available at irregularly-distributed continuous points in time (t0, t1, . . . , tV ). As a consequence, there are two levels of hidden information in a CT-HMM. First, at observation time, the state of the Markov chain is hidden and can only be inferred from measurements. Second, the state transitions in the Markov chain between two consecutive observations are also hidden. As a result, a Markov chain may visit multiple hidden states before reaching a state that emits a noisy observation. This additional complexity makes CT-HMM a more effective model for event data, in comparison to HMM and CTMC. But as a consequence the parameter learning problem is more challenging. We believe we are the first to present a comprehensive and systematic treatment of efficient EM algorithms to address these challenges.\nA fully observed CT-HMM contains four sequences of information: the underlying state transition time (t′0, t ′ 1, . . . , t ′ V ′), the corresponding state Y\n′ = {y0 = s(t′0), ..., yV ′ = s(t′V ′)} of the hidden Markov chain, and the observed data O = (o0, o1, . . . , oV ) at time T = (t0, t1, . . . , tV ). Their joint complete likelihood can be written as\nCL = V ′−1∏ v′=0 qyv′ ,yv′+1e −qy v′ τv′ V∏ v=0 p(ov|s(tv)) = |S|∏ i=1 |S|∏ j=1,j 6=i q nij ij e −qiτi V∏ v=0 p(ov|s(tv)). (4)\nWe will focus our development on the estimation of the transition rate matrix Q. Estimates for the parameters of the emission model p(o|s) and the initial state distribution π can be obtained from the standard discrete time HMM formulation [13], but with time-inhomogeneous transition probabilities (described below)."

The key is to note that the posterior state probabilities are only needed at the times where we have observation data. We can exploit this insight to reformulate the estimation problem in terms of an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model.\nSpecifically, given the current estimate Q̂0, O and T , we will divide the time into V intervals, each with duration τv = tv − tv−1. We then make use of the transition property of CTMC, and associate each interval v with a state transition matrix P v(τv) := eQ̂0τv . Together with the emission model p(o|s), we then have a discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model with joint likelihood:\nV∏ v=1 [P v(τv)](s(tv−1),s(tv)) V∏ v=0 p(ov|s(tv)). (11)\nThe formulation in Eq. 11 allows us to reduce the computation of p(s(tv) = k, s(tv+1) = l|O, T, Q̂0) to familiar operations. The forward-backward algorithm [13] can be used to compute the posterior distribution of the hidden states, which we refer to as the Soft method. Alternatively, the MAP assignment of hidden states obtained from the Viterbi algorithm can provide an approximate distribution, which we refer to as the Hard method."

      "text" : "The remaining step in finalizing the EM algorithm is to discuss the computation of the end-state conditioned expectations for nij and τi from Eqs. 9 and 10, respectively. The first step is to express the expectations in integral form, following [14]:\nE[nij |s(0) = k, s(t) = l, Q] = qi,j\nPk,l(t) ∫ t 0 Pk,i(x)Pj,l(t− x) dx (12)\nE[τi|s(0) = k, s(t) = l, Q] = 1\nPk,l(t) ∫ t 0 Pk,i(x)Pi,l(t− x) dx.

Several methods for computing τ i,jk,l (t) and τ i,i k,l(t) have been proposed in the CTMC literature. Metzner et. al. observe that closed-form expressions can be obtained when Q is diagonalizable [8]. Unfortunately, this property is not guaranteed to exist, and in practice we find that the intermediate Q matrices are frequently not diagonalizable during EM iterations. We refer to this approach as Eigen.\nAn alternative is to leverage a classic method of Van Loan [15] for computing integrals of matrix exponentials. In this approach, an auxiliary matrix A is constructed as A = [ Q B 0 Q ] , where\nB is a matrix with identical dimensions to Q. It is shown in [15] that ∫ t\n0 eQxBeQ(t−x)dt =\n(eAt)(1:n),(n+1):(2n), where n is the dimension of Q. Following [9], we set B = I(i, j), where I(i, j) is the matrix with a 1 in the (i, j)th entry and 0 elsewhere. Thus the left hand side reduces to τ i,jk,l (t) for all k, l in the corresponding matrix entries. Thus we can leverage the substantial literature on numerical computation of the matrix exponential. We refer to this approach as Expm, after the popular Matlab function. A third approach for computing the expectations, introduced by Hobolth and Jensen [9] for CTMCs, is called uniformization (Unif ) and is described in the supplementary material, along with additional details for Expm.\nExpm Based Algorithm Algorithm 2 presents pseudocode for the Expm method for computing end-state conditioned statistics. The algorithm exploits the fact that the A matrix does not change with time t∆. Therefore, when using the scaling and squaring method [16] for computing matrix exponentials, one can easily cache and reuse the intermediate powers of A to efficiently compute etA for different values of t."

The soft version of Eigen has the same time complexity, but since the eigendecomposition of non-symmetric matrices can be ill-conditioned in any EM iteration [17], this method is not attractive. Unif is based on truncating an infinite sum and the truncation point M varies with maxi,t∆ qit∆, with the result that the cost of Unif varies significantly with both the data and the parameters. In comparison, Expm is much less sensitive to these values (log versus quadratic dependency). See the supplemental material for the details. We conclude that Expm is the most robust method available for the soft EM case. When the state space is large, hard EM can be used to tradeoff accuracy with time. In the hard EM case, Unif can be more efficient than Expm, because Unif can evaluate only the expectations specified by the required end-states from the best decoded paths, whereas Expm must always produce results from all end-states.\nThese asymptotic results are consistent with our experimental findings. On the glaucoma dataset from Section 5.2, using a model with 105 states, Soft Expm requires 18 minutes per iteration on a 2.67 GHz machine with unoptimized MATLAB code, while Soft Unif spends more than 105 minutes per iteration, Hard Unif spends 2 minutes per iteration, and Eigen fails."

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and visual morbidity worldwide [18]. This disease is characterized by a slowly progressing optic neuropathy with associated irreversible structural and functional damage. There are conflicting findings in the temporal ordering of detectable structural and functional changes, which confound glaucoma clinical assessment and treatment plans [19]. Here, we use a 2D-grid state space model with 105 states, defined by successive value bands of the two main glaucoma markers, Visual Field Index (VFI) (functional marker) and average RNFL (Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer) thickness (structural marker) with forwarding edges (see Fig. 1(a)). More details of the dataset and model can be found in the supplementary material. We utilize Soft Expm for the following experiments, since it converges quickly (see Fig. 1(c)), has an acceptable computational cost, and exhibits the best performance.\nTo predict future continuous measurements, we follow a simple procedure illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Given a testing patient, Viterbi decoding is used to decode the best hidden state path for the past visits. Then, given a future time t, the most probable future state is predicted by j = maxj Pij(t) (blue node), where i is the current state (black node). To predict the continuous measurements, we search for the future time t1 and t2 in a desired resolution when the patient enters and leaves a state having same value range as state j for each disease marker separately. The measurement at time t can then be computed by linear interpolation between t1 and t2 and the two data bounds of state j for the specified marker ([b1, b2] in Fig. 1(b)). The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted values and the actual measurements was used for performance assessment. The performance of CTHMM was compared to both conventional linear regression and Bayesian joint linear regression [11]. For the Bayesian method, the joint prior distribution of the four parameters (two intercepts and two slopes) computed from the training set [11] is used alongside the data likelihood. The results in Table 2 demonstrate the significantly improved performance of CT-HMM.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we visualize the model trained using the entire dataset. Several dominant paths can be identified: there is an early stage containing RNFL thinning with intact vision (blue vertical path in the first column), and at around RNFL range [80, 85] the transition trend reverses and VFI changes become more evident (blue horizontal paths). This L shape in the disease progression supports the finding in [20] that RNFL thickness of around 77 microns is a tipping point at which functional deterioration becomes clinically observable with structural deterioration. Our 2D CT-HMM model can be used to visualize the non-linear relationship between structural and functional degeneration, yielding insights into the progression process."

The 3D visualization result is shown in Fig. 2(b). The state transition trends show that the abnormality of Aβ level emerges first (blue lines) when cognition scores are still normal. Hippocampus atrophy happens more often (green lines) when Aβ levels are already low and cognition has started to show abnormality. Most cognition degeneration happens (red lines) when both Aβ levels and Hippocampus volume are already in abnormal stages. Our quantitative visualization results supports recent findings that the decreasing of Aβ level in CSF is an early marker before detectable hippocampus atrophy in cognition-normal elderly [22].

However, the lack of an efficient parameter learning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or requires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we present the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning methods for CT-HMM models. We demonstrate that the learning problem consists of two challenges: the estimation of posterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned statistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation problem in terms of an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The second challenge is addressed by adapting three approaches from the continuous time Markov chain literature to the CT-HMM domain. We demonstrate the use of CT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression using a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer’s disease dataset.",
