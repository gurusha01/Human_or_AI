{"title": "Rounding-based Moves for Metric Labeling", "abstract": "Metric labeling is a special case of energy minimization for pairwise Markov random fields. The energy function consists of arbitrary unary potentials, and pairwise potentials that are proportional to a given metric distance function over the label set. Popular methods for solving metric labeling include (i) move-making algorithms, which iteratively solve a minimum st-cut problem; and (ii) the linear programming (LP) relaxation based approach. In order to convert the fractional solution of the LP relaxation to an integer solution, several randomized rounding procedures have been developed in the literature. We consider a large class of parallel rounding procedures, and design move-making algorithms that closely mimic them. We prove that the multiplicative bound of a move-making algorithm exactly matches the approximation factor of the corresponding rounding procedure for any arbitrary distance function. Our analysis includes all known results for move-making algorithms as special cases.", "id": "6974ce5ac660610b44d9b9fed0ff9548", "authors": ["M.

It is a theoretical paper that highlights some interesting connections between move-making algorithms (based on a reduction to min-cut) and certain types of rounding schemes used in combination with linear programming relaxations. Specifically, the paper shows that certain move-making algorithms can match the rounding schemes in terms of approximation guarantees, while allowing for the use of fast min cut solvers. \n\nThe writeup is excellent. It's a theoretical paper but the authors did a great job making the ideas accessible, highlighting the important concepts without overwhelming the reader with technical details. I like that the paper is mostly self-contained, and overall I found it enjoyable to read.\nAlthough the paper is mainly theoretical, I like that the authors also included an experimental section in the supplementary materials to empirically confirm the theory.\n\nOne concern I have is about the novelty of the results. It seems that a number of closely related results were previously known (e.g., reported as corollaries in the supplementary materials). It would be good to specify clearly to what extent Theorems 1, 2 and 3 generalize/extend prior work. Related to this, how do the move-making Algorithms (2, 4 and 6) designed in this paper relate to previous move-making algorithms (e.g., [14,15])? Is there a key difference that allows for a better approximation guarantee? \n\nHow expensive is it to solve the linear program (4) needed for move-making? Is it included in the runtime in the experimental results?\n\nIs Algorithm 6 the one used and called HIER in the experimental section in the supplementary materials?\n\n*** EDIT ***\nThanks for the thorough responses - that clears up my concerns.\n It's a well written paper that makes a nice theoretical contribution by providing theoretical guarantees on the approximation obtained with move-making algorithms, a class of algorithms used to solve the metric labeling problem. It studies an important problem in computer vision and the analysis might lead to the development of new inference algorithms for other combinatorial problems.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The authors analyze the relationship between randomized rounding\nalgorithms and move-making algorithms for metric\nlabeling, which is the problem of MAP inference in a MRF where the\nbinary potentials are proportional to a distance metric on the label\nspace. They demonstrate connections between the two classes of\nalgorithms. For each of three rounding schemes---complete, interval,\nand hierarchical---they present companion move-making algorithms that\nachieve the same worst-case approximation ratio (over all possible\nunary potentials and edge weights) for any particular distance metric\non the label space.\n\nThe primary contribution of the paper is the analysis, which shows\nthat the move-making algorithms have the same approximation guarantees\nas the rounding-based ones. This is significant because the\nrounding-based algorithms have historically come with the strongest\napproximation guarantees, but move-making algorithms are faster. Thus,\nthe guarantees are exported to the faster algorithms.\n\nThe paper can be situated slightly better in terms of prior work. From\nwhat I can tell:\n\n* Previous papers [14,15] have presented move-making algorithms\n similar to those given here and proved approximation factors for\n those algorithms for certain classes of distance functions. \n\n* This work, on the other hand, applies to *any* distance function,\n and shows that the approximation ratio of the rounding scheme\n (for that distance function) is matched by the companion move-making\n algorithm. The difference between this and previous results is\n subtle and could be emphasized more.\n\n* I believe the move-making algorithms themselves are not\n contributions of this paper. It would help a great deal if the\n authors could clearly attribute each algorithm to a particular\n source and describe which parts are their original contributions. \n\nThe paper is well-written and generally well executed. I felt that too\nmuch of the paper was used describing the algorithms in detail\ngiven that the main intellectual contribution seems to be in the\nanalysis.\n\nA significant question that is left unanswered in the main paper is:\nwhat is the general analysis technique for converting a rounding\nscheme to a move-making algorithm? Is there a clear recipe? If not,\nwhat are the significant elements of the analysis? The paper would be\nstrengthened considerably by providing some discussion of this.\n This is a quality paper that establishes theoretical connectionsbetween LP rounding algorithms for metric labeling and move-makingalgorithms.
