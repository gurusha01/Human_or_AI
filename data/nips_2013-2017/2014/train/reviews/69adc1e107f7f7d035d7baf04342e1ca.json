A necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when causal effects in the target domain are estimable from the available information.\n2. A proof that a previously proposed algorithm (TR^mz) for computing the transport formula is complete.\n3. A proof that the do-calculus is complete for establishing mz-transportability of causal effects.\n\n*Quality & Clarity:\nThis is mainly a theoretical paper and the claims are well-supported by the authors. \nIt is well-organized and well-presented. However, the claims and proofs are often quite involved (as also pointed out by the authors) and I found it quite difficult to follow some parts (for example page 6) and fully understand the details. Nevertheless, I would probably attribute this more to the advanced theoretical analysis rather than to the lack of good presentation of the paper. \n\n\nI would propose for improvement:\n- Define what is \"a maximal root set\" in Definition 4 (like in [21]). \n- In Def.5: \"(called an hedge)\" -> \"(called an hedge for P_x(y))\".\n- The definition of an hedge after Definition 4 is confusing. You could include a more rigorous definition of what is an hedge there, instead of including it in Definition 5.\n- What do you mean by \"separable\"?\n- It would be beneficial for the reader to present some parts in a simpler way, if possible.\n\n*Originality & Significance:\nThe paper builds on the NIPS 2013 paper (\"[1] Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments\") which is adequately referenced. [1] included necessary OR sufficient conditions for transportability and proved only soundness of TR^mz. The current paper advances over [1] by providing conditions for complete characterization of transportability, proving that TR^mz is complete and proving that do-calculus is complete for the mz-transportability class. So, I consider the paper having a significant contribution. \n\nTo be more explicit, you could add in the beginning of section 3 that the first part of this section (page 4) repeats from [1] or other publications (not only referring to them in page 4). Also, for eq. (2), add a reference to [1], where it is explain how eq. (2) is acquired.\n\n\nSome more comments:\n- Abstract, 3rd line: it seems that \"limited experimental data\" only refers to the target domain and not to the sources. Consider changing appropriately.\n- Motivation, 1st line: maybe missing a \"that\" after \"experiments\"? Consider rewriting sentence.\n- p.2, par.4: \"the goal of....conditions the causal effect\" -> \"...conditions causal effects in the target domain\"\n- First bullet before section 2: last line: \"in the domains\" -> \"in the source domains\"?\n- Section 2, line 2: you refer to the node S of Fig.1(a) which is missing: Consider adding the letter S in this square node of the figure.\n- Footnote 1: \"..exclusively, on..\" -> \"..exclusively, of..\"\n- Footnote 1: along with refs [13,14] you could also consider some of the following references:\nBen-David et al.

I consider the contribution of this paper significant for NIPS, even though the definitions, theorems and proofs are often quite involved, making it difficult to understand all details.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper is concerned with the problem of transportability, which is a generalization of the problem of identifiability of causal effects given causal assumptions or knowledge encoded in a causal diagram. A paper published in NIPS last year by Bareinboim et al. tackled a quite general version of the problem. Suppose we observe a set of variables in a number of domains, a target domain and one or more source domains, all of which are assumed to share a (known) qualitative causal structure over the observed variables and some latent variables. The structural equations possibly differ between a source domain and the target domain, as indicated by selection variables in the so-called selection diagrams, which are also assumed to be known. Moreover, suppose in each domain, a subset of the observed variables can be actively controlled to collect interventional data (limited experiments). The question is whether or not a certain interventional probability in the target domain is (non-parametrically) identifiable from the available observational and interventional distributions in all the domains. The paper under review presents further results on the problem, showing that the sound algorithm presented in Bareinboim et al.\u2019s paper in last year\u2019s NIPS is actually complete and that Pearl\u2019s do-calculus is also complete with regard to this problem. \n \nThe new results are useful contributions to a well-defined and interesting line of research, which has to do with such important topics as \u201cexternal validity\u201d and \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d. Part of the paper is quite dense and probably not very readable for readers who are not familiar with previous work, but the main ideas are sufficiently clear. I have a few comments/questions:\n\n1. In Definition 1, Pearl\u2019s definition of structural equation models is implicitly taken in which each structural equation is associated with one and only one U-variable, i.e., that the structural equation f_i (for variable V_i) is associated with U_i. It is thus a little confusing when several U-variables appear in the subsequent examples on p. 5 and elsewhere. \n\n2. An assumption made in Definition 2 is that if a set Z can be subject to an intervention in a domain, then any subset of Z can be subject to an intervention (without affecting other variables in Z) in that domain. Can this assumption be relaxed?\n\n3. I understand that Theorem 1 is from Bareinboim et al. (2013), but I found the statement a little odd. What does it mean to say that \"a do-operator has no S_i-variables\"? Does it mean that the do-operator does not apply to any S_i-variable? But if a do-operator applies to a subset of I_z^i, doesn\u2019t it automatically follow that it does not apply to any S_i-variable? Also, it seems an expression in which every do-operator applies to some set other than subsets of I_z^i would satisfy (1). \n \n4. In footnote 5, it is suggested that causal discovery methods might be used to learn the causal diagrams. It may be worth stressing that the causal discovery algorithms can rarely, if ever, learn the full causal diagram with latent variables. Also, I am curious how selection diagrams are to be learned from data. \n \n5. Definition 5 is the key in the paper, but its statement and the subsequent remarks are quite dense. Perhaps it will be easier to read if the definition of \u201chedge\u201d is first given separately, and a \u201cmz-shedge\u201d is then defined as a collection of hedges that satisfy certain conditions. \n\nIn the subsequent paragraph, it will probably help if the conditions 1, 2, and 3 in the definition can be explicitly linked to conditions (i) and (ii). \n\nThe remark at the bottom of the page \u201cAlso, it might happen that the root set R must be augmented \u2026\u201d is elusive. I would appreciate a clarification of what it means. \n The paper establishes new, useful results on an interesting problem.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper address the necessary and sufficient condition for deciding the feasibility of mz-transportability. mz-transportability is a property of a causal effect which relation in a target domain can be uniquely computed from its relations in different domains. This idea is considered to provide a basis of scientific discovery in unexplored domain based on the knowledge on our well-explored domains. The key consequence of this paper is the completeness of the do-calculus, i.e., there exists a set of the control operations of variables to judge any mz-transportability, and they showed that an algorithm presented in a past study to recognize mz-transportability is complete.\n\nQuality\n The theoretical analysis and its consequences presented in this paper seems valid. Though this is theoretical work, the proofs of many theorems are not provided in the main body of this paper. But, the lack of the proofs is acceptable, since these proofs are too lengthy to fit in the paper. Except this point, theoretical key points are well articulated. \n A drawback is that the feasibility and the tractability of the actual implementation of the algorithm are not clear. Yet, the outcome on the completeness of the do-calculus across multiple domains is very important result, and will provide a basis of the future causal inference study.\n\nClarity\n The paper is well written. Main claims of the authors are well described. As I pointed out above,the theoretical key pints are well articulated. The given set of the theorems and the corollaries seem appropriate.\n But, the notations and the explanations in this paper seem too involved in the field of causal inference. The readers unfamiliar with the field will have many difficulties to understand them. In this regard, some descriptions in the paper should be even more well designed. I see some rooms to improve the explanations in the paper including the following points.\n* 4th line of Section 3\nMx = (U,V,Fx,P(U)) suddenly appears without any explanation of the notation. I see some explanation on V on page 5; \"Let V be the set of observable ....\". But, including V, this formulation should be comprehensively described at the top of the section 3.\n* In definition 1\n\"D contains an extra edge from Si to Vi\". This is a description of an edge without explaining about Si. What is \"S-variables\"? It is unclear. To me, it seems unobserved exogenous variable or noise in the latter explanation. But, it should be more comprehensively explained around this definition.\n\nOriginality\nThe idea presented in this paper seems an extension of the work of J. Pearl et al.'s papers recently presented in AAAI, NIPS and AISTATS. In this regard, this work is rather incremental. However, the completeness of the do-calculus in terms of the mz-transportability across multiple domains provides a theoretical basis of causal inference. Its content to originally clarify this feature of the calculus is attractive. In addition, the proposal of mz*-shedge, which plays a central role to derive the completeness and the associated algorithms, is original.\n\nSignificance\nThe idea of mz*-shedge and the completeness of the do-calculus in terms of the mz-transportability have a potentially large contribution to the future study of causal inference.\n The description of this paper is rather involved in the field of causal inference. But, the idea proposed and presented in this paper will provide a fundamental basis of the many future studies of causal inference.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
