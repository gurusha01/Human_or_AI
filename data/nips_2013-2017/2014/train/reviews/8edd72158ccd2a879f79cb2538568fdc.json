{"title": "Diverse Randomized Agents Vote to Win", "abstract": "We investigate the power of voting among diverse, randomized software agents. With teams of computer Go agents in mind, we develop a novel theoretical model of two-stage noisy voting that builds on recent work in machine learning. This model allows us to reason about a collection of agents with different biases (determined by the first-stage noise models), which, furthermore, apply randomized algorithms to evaluate alternatives and produce votes (captured by the second-stage noise models). We analytically demonstrate that a uniform team, consisting of multiple instances of any single agent, must make a significant number of mistakes, whereas a diverse team converges to perfection as the number of agents grows. Our experiments, which pit teams of computer Go agents against strong agents, provide evidence for the effectiveness of voting when agents are diverse.", "id": "8edd72158ccd2a879f79cb2538568fdc", "authors": ["Albert Jiang", "Leandro Soriano Marcolino", "Ariel D.

One can consider the agents as sampling from a noisy distribution centered around the true ranking of the alternatives at each state. They show that if the agents are copies of each other, in the sense that the agents produce samples (preferences for alternatives) from the same distribution then it is likely that system votes for a sub-optimal alternative. On the other hand, if we have many agents that have sufficient diversity then the system is likely to vote for the optimal alternatives in almost every state. The paper then concludes with an experimental study of agents playing Go games. \n\nThe paper is clear and well written, however, it was not clear to the reviewer what the new contributions are over existing results which qualitatively resemble this paper's results (such as Marcolino's work that they refer to). It seems that the main difference in the setting is that agents can give a preference ordering for alternatives at each stage rather than vote for a single alternative. \n\nMinor: In the experimental section of the paper diverse agents are generated by varying parameters in an existing Go playing agent. From the perspective of a reader unfamiliar with the details of the system, it is not obvious that such parametrization will indeed result in a diverse set of agents. The paper does discuss this issue in Appendix H and towards the end of section 4, it would be better if this justification (or reference to Appendix H) is added earlier when the agents are introduced. The results of the paper are interesting but a more detailed comparison to related work is needed.[Revised, following author feedback].", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper provides a framework for analyzing the quality of a vote among a team of agents (compared to some underlying true ranking) where the teams are generated differently: by multiple instantiations of the same agent (\"Uniform\"), and by a single instantiation of several different types of agents (\"Diverse\"). Under some conditions, the authors show that as the number of agents grow the Diverse team converges in probability almost surely to choosing the correct choice, where the Uniform team always has a non-zero probability of making a mistake. \n\nThe paper is quite clear and the technical quality is high. The results are significant and relevant. The main idea here is that voting among a diverse team leads to robust choices, whereas a population of fixed players does not have enough variance and will play \"too predictably\", but the authors provide a nice theoretical foundation to quantify these notions and show that even diversity obtained from a single (widely-used) Go program with different parameters can lead to significant performance boosts in 9x9 Go (against the same copies of the optimally-tuned parameter version of the Go program) when using an appropriate voting scheme. The authors also show how their assumptions and voting rules relate to other rules used in the literature. \n\nI have a some problems with the paper. The first is that there seems to be a disconnect between the experiments and the foundations that came before it. The experimental section is specific, focusing on the single application to Go, while the theoretical framework is quite general. I was expecting to see experiments comparing different noise models, something that validates the assumptions listed in section 3, or some stronger link between the first half of the paper and second. As far as I can tell there is no mention of whether the Go application even satisfies the assumptions 1-4, so does Theorem 2 even hold in this experiment? This is also true for the discussion section, which seems to again focus on the application to games while the first part is more general.Also, as this is follow-up work based heavily on past work ([18,19]) the authors should do a better job of highlighting what is new in this paper. The noise model approach certainly seems appropriate for the computer Go setting where there indeed is some underlying true ranking of alternatives, but this might not be true in other more general social choice settings such as elections.. can anything be said on whether this approach could be applied when the existence of a true ranking is unknown?\n This paper provides a significant theoretical result that established the asymptotic optimality of a team of diverse agents (under certain appropriate assumptions) while showing suboptimality of a team of uniform agents. The experimental results, while significant, feel somewhat disconnected from the main results and the originality compared to previous work could be more clear.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "In this paper, the author propose a novel two-stage noisy voting model and theoretically demonstrated that a uniform team must make some mistakes, whereas a diverse team converges to perfection as the number of agents grows. The result of the experiment, which was conducted in the Computer Go domain, is consistent with the theoretical analysis.\n\nThis paper is well-written, and the results are solid and interesting. This work has both theoretical and methodological contributions:\n1.Prove diverse vote can beat uniform vote under their proposed restrictions on noise models, i.e., PD-alpha, PM-alpha, PPM-alpha. Furthermore, they show these assumptions in the theorem is mild by demonstrating that the three classical noise model satisfy all assumptions. As a result, the theorem can be widely used.\n2.In the experiment, authors automatically generating arbitrarily many diverse agents and extracting rankings of moves from algorithms, are practical. \n\nFollowing are concerns about this paper:\n1. The novelty of this paper: Please make a clear statement on the technical contribution of this paper comparing to Marcolino et. al. 2013.\n\n2. The experiment: although authors explains that there may be gap between figure (a) and the main theorem, the obvious winning rate drop for diverse+Copeland is somehow indicating the performance of diverse voting is not robust under some voting rule. A more comprehensive experiment results will offer more insights to this problem. Authors said that it is time-consuming to present diverse + all voting rules. Please give more explanations to the computation cost, and it would be better if the authors try to conquer it by some tricks.\n\n3. For Go, the state are dependent but not i.i.d.. The setting of the main results of this paper is not suitable for Go. \n\nMinor comments: 1. Please indicate the domain of phi in Mallows model. 2. Add one bullet for Plackett-Luce model. 3. \u201ck\u201d is used to indicate positions. Please use another notation for copy number in uniform vote.\n This paper is well-written, and results is interesting. Authors need to state their technical contribution with a very related reference.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
