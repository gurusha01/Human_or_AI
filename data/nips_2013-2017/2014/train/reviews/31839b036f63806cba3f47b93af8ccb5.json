{"title": "Graphical Models for Recovering Probabilistic and Causal Queries from Missing Data", "abstract": "We address the problem of deciding whether a causal or probabilistic query is estimable from data corrupted by missing entries, given a model of missingness process. We extend the results of Mohan et al, 2013 by presenting more general conditions for recovering probabilistic queries of the form P(y|x) and P(y,x) as well as causal queries of the form P(y|do(x)). We show that causal queries may be recoverable even when the factors in their identifying estimands are not recoverable. Specifically, we derive graphical conditions for recovering causal effects of the form P(y|do(x)) when Y and its missingness mechanism are not d-separable. Finally, we apply our results to problems of attrition and characterize the recovery of causal effects from data corrupted by attrition.", "id": "31839b036f63806cba3f47b93af8ccb5", "authors": ["Karthika Mohan", "Judea Pearl"], "conference": "NIPS2014", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The paper deals with the problem of identifiability in the presence of various generated mechanisms for missing data, using a framework introduced by Mohan and others. Some existing results are improved upon, and some nice examples are given (such as identifiability of causal distributions even when conditional distributions are unavailable).\n\nQuality\n\nTechnical quality seems high, the results are very involved but appear to be correct. Results like Theorem 3 are clear and interpretable. Some of the results are incremental improvements upon existing ones, and don't contribute (so far as I can see) to a bigger picture of what is really going on here.\n\nSection 3 seems orthogonal to the rest of the paper, and its main result (Theorem 1) is quite hard to comprehend. It seems to be closely related to the Markov blanket results in Richardson (2009). The quality improves later on, with section 5 giving some nice clear answers, and Section 6 some interesting results about causal queries.\n\n---\n\nClarity\n\nThis is the paper's main weakness. Firstly, there is probably too much material for a conference paper here (though the importance of some of it is unclear), as evidenced by the density of the text and the 13 page technical appendix. The article does not flow clearly, and is hard to follow as a result - probably this would work better as a longer, more considered, journal paper.\n\nWhilst finding good notation for so many quantities is not easy, the notation could certainly be improved. The use of the same capital 'V' to denote so many different objects makes it hard work for the reader, and in places the subscripts become illegible. In addition, the fact that V_i is a vertex but V_o a set of vertices is particularly confusing. The set equation in Corollary 1 is perhaps the most extreme example of poor presentation.\n\n---\n\nOriginality and Significance\n\nSections 5 and 6 are clear and interesting, and potentially quite significant. This paper deals with an important problem, and contains results which seem genuinely interesting and useful. \n\nIt would perhaps be better to step back and work out what is going on in the general case, and (try to) come up with a complete criterion for identifiability in this framework (as was achieved in the case of finding causal effects without missingness). It is difficult to imagine a statistician trawling through a series of papers like this to find the precise result which shows (non)-identifiability of the causal effect she is interested in, especially if that result is as complicated as Theorem 1.\n\nTheorem 2 and Corollary 1 seem to be a form of inverse probability weighting. The reason that these results work is presumably something to do with the conditioning sets being Markov blankets for R(i) in the mixed graphs the author is using. Richardson (2003) and (2009) might be relevant. \n\n---\n\nOther Comments\n\np4, l214: R^part _is_ a partition of R, not \"a set containing partitions\".

It extends previous works that explicitly model the missing data generating mechanism into the causal diagram. The paper is clearly written and while it builds up on previous contributions using this approach, the additional insights provided constitute, in the opinion of this reviewer, a valuable contribution to the state of the art in the analysis of causal mechanisms in the presence of missing data.

It addresses the problem of when a distribution may be recovered from knowledge of the generating process and the process leading to missing data.\n\nThe paper considers a more general class of missingness process than considered in earlier work by Mohan et al.\nThis leads to a novel identification formula.\n\nIn addition the authors consider the identification of causal queries and show that these can be identified even when the (observational) joint distribution is not identified.\n\nThe paper is generally well-written, though there are some glitches and areas for improvement I describe below.\n\nMAIN COMMENTS:\n\n(1) The results here require knowledge of the process by which observations are censored. \nIs this knowledge available in typical machine learning applications?\nIt would be helpful to include more of the detail regarding Figure 1 in the main paper. (This could be done by making the Figure smaller.)\n\n(2) Section 2. It should be mentioned that the missing data processes here always assume that the full population is known:\nEven if V_o = emptyset, and R_v =1 for all V in V_m (so no variables are observed for this individual) it is still supposed that we know this individual exists. \n(This excludes missing data problems such as estimating the number of animals in a population.) \n\n(3) The term mgraph seems to be used ambiguously. In particular, sometimes the graph includes the V* variables (Figure 1)\nat other times it does not (Figure 2). If the V* variables are simply being omitted in these graphs then this should be explained.\n\n(4) In this paper mgraphs are not allowed to have R variables as parents of variables in V or U.\nGiven that the authors describe treat the R variables as real quantities not simply indicators, they should explain why this restriction is justified (or whether it is mainly for convenience).\n\n(5) The term 'neighbor', which appears at the bottom of p.4 is not defined.\n\n(6) p. 8 first paragraph. \"rectification\" of the observation by Garcia.\nrecoverability as defined by the authors assumes positivity. Do Garcia et al also assume positivity?\nIf not, they might require a stronger condition.\n\n(7) p.8 second paragraph. \"Maximum Likelihood method is known to yield consistent estimates under MAR assumption\".\nThis is much too vague. Why could maximum likelihood not be applied to any of the missingness processes described here.\n\n\nMINOR COMMENTS\n\nP.1 line 33. can bias outcomes\n\np.2 figure 1.
