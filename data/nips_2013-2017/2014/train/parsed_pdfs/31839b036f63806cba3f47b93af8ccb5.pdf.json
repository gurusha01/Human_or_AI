      "text" : "All branches of experimental science are plagued by missing data. Improper handling of missing data can bias outcomes and potentially distort the conclusions drawn from a study. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of the causes of missingness is crucial for the success of any research. We employ a formal representation called ‘Missingness Graphs’ (m-graphs, for short) to explicitly portray the missingness process as well as the dependencies among variables in the available dataset (Mohan et al. [2013]). Apart from determining whether recoverability is feasible namely, whether there exists any theoretical impediment to estimability of queries of interest, m-graphs can also provide a means for communication and refinement of assumptions about the missingness process. Furthermore, m-graphs permit us to detect violations in modeling assumptions even when the dataset is contaminated with missing entries (Mohan and Pearl [2014]).\nIn this paper, we extend the results of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting general conditions under which probabilistic queries such as joint and conditional distributions can be recovered. We show that causal queries of the type P (y|do(x)) can be recovered even when the associated probabilistic relations such as P (y, x) and P (y|x) are not recoverable. In particular, causal effects may be recoverable even when Y is not separable from its missingness mechanism. Finally, we apply our results to recover causal effects when the available dataset is tainted by attrition.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of missingness graphs and reviews the notion of recoverability i.e. obtaining consistent estimates of a query, given a dataset and an m-graph. Section 3 refines the sequential factorization theorem presented in Mohan et al. [2013] and extends its applicability to a wider range of problems in which missingness mechanisms may influence each other. In section 4, we present general\nalgorithms to recover joint distributions from the class of problems for which sequential factorization theorem fails. In section 5, we introduce new graphical criteria that preclude recoverability of joint and conditional distributions. In section 6, we discuss recoverability of causal queries and show that unlike probabilistic queries, P (y|do(x)) may be recovered even when Y and its missingness mechanism (Ry) are not d-separable. In section 7, we demonstrate how we can apply our results to problems of attrition in which missingness is a severe obstacle to sound inferences. Related works are discussed in section 8 and conclusions are drawn in section 9. Proofs of all theoretical results in this paper are provided in the appendix."

      "text" : "Missingness graphs as discussed below was first defined in Mohan et al. [2013] and we adopt the same notations. Let G(V, E) be the causal DAG where V = V ∪ U ∪ V ∗ ∪ R. V is the set of observable nodes. Nodes in the graph correspond to variables in the data set. U is the set of unobserved nodes (also called latent variables). E is the set of edges in the DAG. We use bi-directed edges as a shorthand notation to denote the existence of a U variable as common parent of two variables in V ∪ R. V is partitioned into Vo and Vm such that Vo ⊆ V is the set of variables that are observed in all records in the population and Vm ⊆ V is the set of variables that are missing in at least one record. Variable X is termed as fully observed if X ∈ Vo, partially observed if X ∈ Vm and substantive if X ∈ Vo∪Vm. Associated with every partially observed variable Vi ∈ Vm are two other variables Rvi and V ∗ i , where V ∗i is a proxy variable that is actually observed, and Rvi represents the status of the causal mechanism responsible for the missingness of V ∗i ; formally,\nv∗i = f(rvi , vi) =\n{\nvi if rvi = 0 m if rvi = 1\n(1)\nV ∗ is the set of all proxy variables and R is the set of all causal mechanisms that are responsible for missingness. R variables may not be parents of variables in V ∪ U . We call this graphical representation Missingness Graph (or m-graph). An example of an m-graph is given in Figure 1 (a).We use the following shorthand. For any variable X, let X ′ be a shorthand for X = 0. For any set W ⊆ Vm ∪ Vo ∪ R, let Wr, Wo and Wm be the shorthand for W ∩R, W ∩ Vo and W ∩ Vm respectively. Let Rw be a shorthand for RVm∩W i.e. Rw is the set containing missingness mechanisms of all partially observed variables in W . Note that Rw and Wr are not the same. GX and GX represent graphs formed by removing from G all edges leaving and entering X, respectively.\nA manifest distribution P (Vo, V ∗, R) is the distribution that governs the available dataset. An underlying distribution P (Vo, Vm, R) is said to be compatible with a given manifest distribution P (Vo, V\n∗, R) if the latter can be obtained from the former using equation 1. Manifest distribution Pm is compatible with a given underlying distribution Pu if ∀X, X ⊆\nVm and Y = Vm \\X, the following equality holds true.\nPm(R ′ x, Ry, X ∗, Y ∗, Vo) = Pu(R ′ x, Ry, X, Vo)\nwhere R′x denotes Rx = 0 and Ry denotes Ry = 1.

      "text" : "Mohan et al. [2013] (theorem-4) presented a sufficient condition for recovering probabilistic queries such as joint and conditional distributions by using ordered factorizations. However, the theorem is not applicable to certain classes of problems such as those in longitudinal studies in which edges exist between R variables. General ordered factorization defined below broadens the concept of ordered factorization (Mohan et al. [2013]) to include the set of R variables. Subsequently, the modified theorem (stated below as theorem 1) will permit us to handle cases in which R variables are contained in separating sets that d-separate partially observed variables from their respective missingness mechanisms (example: X⊥⊥Rx|Ry in figure 2 (a)).\nDefinition 2 (General Ordered factorization). Given a graph G and a set O of ordered V ∪R variables Y1 < Y2 < . . . < Yk, a general ordered factorization relative to G, denoted by f(O), is a product of conditional probabilities f(O) = ∏\ni P (Yi|Xi) where Xi ⊆ {Yi+1, . . . , Yn} is a minimal set such that Yi⊥⊥({Yi+1, . . . , Yn} \\Xi)|Xi holds in G.\nTheorem 1 (Sequential Factorization ). A sufficient condition for recoverability of a relation Q defined over substantive variables is that Q be decomposable into a general ordered factorization, or a sum of such factorizations, such that every factor Qi = P (Yi|Xi) satisfies, (1) Yi⊥⊥(Ryi , Rxi)|Xi \\{Ryi , Rxi}, if Yi ∈ (Vo∪Vm) and (2) Z /∈ Xi and Xr∩RXm = ∅ and Rz⊥⊥RXi |Xi if Yi = Rz for any Z ∈ Vm.\nAn ordered factorization that satisfies the condition in Theorem 1 is called an admissible sequence.\nThe following example illustrates the use of theorem 1 for recovering the joint distribution. Additionally, it sheds light on the need for the notion of minimality in definition 2.\n1An extension to datasets that are not strictly positive over complete cases is sometimes feasible(Mohan et al. [2013]).\nExample 1. We are interested in recovering P (X,Y, Z) given the m-graph in Figure 2 (a). We discern from the graph that definition 2 is satisfied because: (1) P (Y |X,Z,Ry) = P (Y |X,Z) and (X,Z) is a minimal set such that Y⊥⊥({X,Z,Ry} \\ (X,Z))|(X,Z), (2) P (X|Ry, Z) = P (X|Ry) and Ry is the minimal set such that X⊥⊥({Ry, Z} \\ Ry)|Ry and (3) P (Z|Ry) = P (Z) and ∅ is the minimal set such that Z⊥⊥Ry|∅. Therefore, the order Y < X < Z < Ry induces a general ordered factorization P (X,Y, Z,Ry) = P (Y |X,Z)P (X|Ry)P (Z)P (Ry). We now rewrite P (X,Y, Z) as follows:\nP (X,Y, Z) = ∑\nRy P (Y,X,Z,Ry) = P (Y |X,Z)P (Z)\n∑\nRy P (X|Ry)P (Ry)\nSince Y⊥⊥Ry|X,Z, Z⊥⊥Rz, X⊥⊥Rx|Ry, by theorem 1 we have,\nP (X,Y, Z) = P (Y |X,Z,R′x, R ′ y, R ′ z)P (Z|R ′ z)\n∑\nRy P (X|R′x, Ry)P (Ry)\nIndeed, equation 1 permits us to rewrite it as:\nP (X,Y, Z) = P (Y ∗|X∗, Z∗, R′x, R ′ y, R ′ z)P (Z ∗|R′z) ∑ Ry P (X∗|R′x, Ry)P (Ry)\nP (X,Y, Z) is recoverable because every term in the right hand side is consistently estimable from the available dataset.\nHad we ignored the minimality requirement in definition 2 and chosen to factorize Y < X < Z < Ry using the chain rule, we would have obtained: P (X,Y, Z,Ry) = P (Y |X,Z,Ry)P (X|Z,Ry)P (Z|Ry)P (Ry) which is not admissible since X⊥⊥(Rz, Rx)|Z does not hold in the graph. In other words, existence of one admissible sequence based on an order O of variables does not guarantee that every factorization based on O is admissible; it is for this reason that we need to impose the condition of minimality in definition 2.\nThe recovery procedure presented in example 1 requires that we introduce Ry into the order. Indeed, there is no ordered factorization over the substantive variables {X,Y, Z} that will permit recoverability of P (X,Y, Z) in figure 2 (a). This extension of Mohan et al. [2013] thus permits the recovery of probabilistic queries from problems in which the missingness mechanisms interact with one another."

[2013] presented a theorem (refer appendix 10.4) that stated the necessary and sufficient condition for recovering the joint distribution for the class of problems in which the parent set of every R variable is a subset of Vo∪Vm. In contrast to Theorem 1, their theorem can handle problems for which no admissible sequence exists. The following theorem gives a generalization and is applicable to any given semi-markovian model (for example, m-graphs in figure 2 (b) & (c)). It relies on the notion of collider path and two new subsets, R(part): the partitions of R variables and Mb(R(i)): substantive variables related to R(i), which we will define after stating the theorem.\nTheorem 2. Given an m-graph G in which no element in Vm is either a neighbor of its missingness mechanism or connected to its missingness mechanism by a collider path, P (V ) is recoverable if no Mb(R(i)) contains a partially observed variable X such that Rx ∈ R (i) i.e. ∀i, R(i) ∩RMb(R(i)) = ∅. Moreover, if recoverable, P (V ) is given by,\nP (V ) = P (V,R = 0) ∏\ni P (R (i) = 0|Mb(R(i)), RMb(R(i)) = 0)\nIn theorem 2: (i) collider path p between any two nodes X and Y is a path in which every intermediate node is a collider.

In figure 2 (b): Rpart = {R(1), R(2)} where R(1) = {Rw, Rz}, R (2) = {Rx, Ry}\n(iii) Mb(R(i)) is the markov blanket of R(i) comprising of all substantive variables that are either neighbors or connected to variables in R(i) by a collider path (Richardson [2003]). In figure 2 (b): Mb(R(1)) = {X,Y } and Mb(R(2)) = {Z,W}.\nAppendix 10.6 demonstrates how theorem 2 leads to the recoverability of P (V ) in figure 2, to which theorems in Mohan et al. [2013] do not apply.\nThe following corollary yields a sufficient condition for recovering the joint distribution from the class of problems in which no bi-directed edge exists between variables in sets R and Vo∪Vm (for example, the m-graph described in Figure 2 (c)). These problems form a subset of the class of problems covered in theorem 2. Subset Pasub(R(i)) used in the corollary is the set of all substantive variables that are parents of variables in R(i). In figure 2 (b): Pasub(R(1)) = ∅ and Pasub(R(2)) = {Z,W}.\nCorollary 1. Let G be an m-graph such that (i) ∀X ∈ Vm ∪ Vo, no latent variable is a common parent of X and any member of R, and (ii) ∀Y ∈ Vm, Y is not a parent of Ry. If ∀i, Pasub(R(i)) does not contain a partially observed variables whose missing mechanism is in R(i) i.e. R(i) ∩RPasub(R(i)) = ∅, then P (V ) is recoverable and is given by,\nP (v) = P (R=0,V )∏ i P (R(i)=0|Pasub(R(i)),R Pasub(R(i)) =0)"

      "text" : "Given a causal query and a causal bayesian network a complete algorithm exists for deciding whether the query is identifiable or not (Shpitser and Pearl [2006]). Obviously, a query that is not identifiable in the substantive model is not recoverable from missing data. Therefore, a necessary condition for recoverability of a causal query is its identifiability which we will assume in the rest of our discussion.\nDefinition 3 (Trivially Recoverable Query). A causal query Q is said to be trivially recoverable given an m-graph G if it has an estimand (in terms of substantive variables) in which every factor is recoverable.\nClasses of problems that fall into the MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) and MAR (Missing At Random) category are much discussed in the literature ((Rubin [1976])) because in such categories probabilistic queries are recoverable by graph-blind algorithms. An immediate but important implication of trivial recoverability is that if data are MAR or MCAR and the query is identifiable, then it is also recoverable by model-blind algorithms.\nExample 2. In the gender wage-gap study example in Figure 1 (a), the effect of sex on income, P (I|do(S)), is identifiable and is given by P (I|S). By theorem 2, P (S,X,Q, I) is recoverable. Hence P (I|do(S)) is recoverable.\n6.1 Recovering P (y|do(z)) when Y and Ry are inseparable\nThe recoverability of P (V ) hinges on the separability of a partially observed variable from its missingness mechanism (a condition established in theorem 3). Remarkably, causal queries may circumvent this requirement. The following example demonstrates that P (y|do(z)) is recoverable even when Y and Ry are not separable. Example 3. Examine Figure 3. By backdoor criterion, P (y|do(z)) = ∑\nw P (y|z, w)P (w). One might be tempted to conclude that the causal relation is non-recoverable because P (w, z, y) is non-recoverable (by theorem 2) and P (y|z, w) is not recoverable (by corollary 2). However, P (y|do(z)) is recoverable as demonstrated below:\nP (y|do(z)) = P (y|do(z), R′y) = ∑\nw\nP (y|do(z), w,R′y)P (w|do(z), R ′ y) (2)\nP (y|do(z), w,R′y) = P (y|z, w,R ′ y) (by Rule-2 of do-calculus (Pearl [2009])) (3)\nP (w|do(z), R′y) = P (w|R ′ y) (by Rule-3 of do-calculus) ) (4)\nSubstituting (3) and (4) in (2) we get:\nP (y|do(z)) = ∑\nw\nP (y|z, w,R′y)P (w|R ′ y) =\n∑\nw\nP (y∗|z, w,R′y)P (w|R ′ y)\nThe recoverability of P (y|do(z)) in the previous example follows from the notion of d*separability and dormant independence [Shpitser and Pearl, 2008].\nDefinition 4 (d∗-separation (Shpitser and Pearl [2008])). Let G be a causal diagram. Variable sets X, Y are d∗-separated in G given Z, W (written X ⊥w Y |Z), if we can find sets Z,W , such that X ⊥ Y |Z in Gw, and P (y, x|z, do(w)) is identifiable.\nDefinition 5 (Inducing path (Verma and Pearl [1991])). An path p between X and Y is called inducing path if every node on the path is a collider and an ancestor of either X or Y .\nTheorem 4. Given an m-graph in which |Vm| = 1 and Y and Ry are connected by an inducing path, P (y|do(x)) is recoverable if there exists Z,W such that Y ⊥w Ry|Z and for W = W \\X, the following conditions hold: (1) Y⊥⊥W1|X,Z in GX,W1 and (2) P (W1, Z|do(X)) and P (Y |do(W1), do(X), Z,R ′y) are identifiable. Moreover, if recoverable then, P (y|do(x)) = ∑\nW1,Z P (Y |do(W ), do(X), Z,R′y)P (Z,W1|do(X))\nWe can quickly conclude that P (y|do(z)) is recoverable in the m-graph in figure 3 by verifying that the conditions in theorem 4 hold in the m-graph."

Clearly, due to randomization, the effect of treatment (X) on outcome (Y), P (y|do(x)), is identifiable and is given by P (Y |X).

      "text" : "Deletion based methods such as listwise deletion that are easy to understand as well as implement, guarantee consistent estimates only for certain categories of missingness such as MCAR (Rubin [1976]). Maximum Likelihood method is known to yield consistent estimates under MAR assumption; expectation maximization algorithm and gradient based algorithms are widely used for searching for ML estimates under incomplete data (Lauritzen [1995], Dempster et al. [1977], Darwiche [2009], Koller and Friedman [2009]). Most work in machine learning assumes MAR and proceeds with ML or Bayesian inference. However, there are exceptions such as recent work on collaborative filtering and recommender systems which\ndevelop probabilistic models that explicitly incorporate missing data mechanism (Marlin et al. [2011], Marlin and Zemel [2009], Marlin et al. [2007]).\nOther methods for handling missing data can be classified into two: (a) Inverse Probability Weighted Methods and (b) Imputation based methods (Rothman et al. [2008]). Inverse Probability Weighing methods analyze and assign weights to complete records based on estimated probabilities of completeness (Van der Laan and Robins [2003], Robins et al. [1994]). Imputation based methods substitute a reasonable guess in the place of a missing value (Allison [2002]) and Multiple Imputation (Little and Rubin [2002]) is a widely used imputation method.\nMissing data is a special case of coarsened data and data are said to be coarsened at random (CAR) if the coarsening mechanism is only a function of the observed data (Heitjan and Rubin [1991]). Robins and Rotnitzky [1992] introduced a methodology for parameter estimation from data structures for which full data has a non-zero probability of being fully observed and their methodology was later extended to deal with censored data in which complete data on subjects are never observed (Van Der Laan and Robins [1998]).\nThe use of graphical models for handling missing data is a relatively new development. Daniel et al. [2012] used graphical models for analyzing missing information in the form of missing cases (due to sample selection bias). Attrition is a common occurrence in longitudinal studies and arises when subjects drop out of the study (Twisk and de Vente [2002], Shadish [2002]) and Garcia [2013] analysed the problem of attrition using causal graphs. Thoemmes and Rose [2013] cautioned the practitioner that contrary to popular belief, not all auxiliary variables reduce bias. Both Garcia [2013] and Thoemmes and Rose [2013] associate missingness with a single variable and interactions among several missingness mechanisms are unexplored.\nMohan et al. [2013] employed a formal representation called Missingness Graphs to depict the missingness process, defined the notion of recoverability and derived conditions under which queries would be recoverable when datasets are categorized as Missing Not At Random (MNAR). Tests to detect misspecifications in the m-graph are discussed in Mohan and Pearl [2014]."

We show that causal queries of the type P (y|do(x)) can be recovered even when the associated probabilistic relations such as P (y, x) and P (y|x) are not recoverable. In particular, causal effects may be recoverable even when Y is not separable from its missingness mechanism. Finally, we apply our results to recover causal effects when the available dataset is tainted by attrition. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of missingness graphs and reviews the notion of recoverability i.e. obtaining consistent estimates of a query, given a dataset and an m-graph. Section 3 refines the sequential factorization theorem presented in Mohan et al.

We extend the results of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting more general conditions for recovering probabilistic queries of the form P (y|x) and P (y, x) as well as causal queries of the form P (y|do(x)). We show that causal queries may be recoverable even when the factors in their identifying estimands are not recoverable. Specifically, we derive graphical conditions for recovering causal effects of the form P (y|do(x)) when Y and its missingness mechanism are not d-separable. Finally, we apply our results to problems of attrition and characterize the recovery of causal effects from data corrupted by attrition.",
