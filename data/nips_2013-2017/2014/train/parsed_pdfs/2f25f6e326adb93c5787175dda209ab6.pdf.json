      "text" : "Matrix factorization methods currently enjoy a large popularity in machine learning and signal processing. In the latter field, the input data is usually a time-frequency transform of some original time series x(t). For example, in the audio setting, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is commonly used to decompose magnitude or power spectrograms into elementary components [1]; the spectrogram, say S, is approximately factorized into WH, where W is the dictionary matrix collecting spectral patterns in its columns and H is the activation matrix. The approximate WH is generally of lower rank than S, unless additional constraints are imposed on the factors.\nNMF was originally designed in a deterministic setting [2]: a measure of fit between S and WH is minimized with respect to (w.r.t) W and H. Choosing the “right” measure for a specific type of data and task is not straightforward. Furthermore, NMF-based spectral decompositions often arbitrarily discard phase information: only the magnitude of the complex-valued short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is considered. To remedy these limitations, a generative probabilistic latent factor model of the STFT was proposed in [3]. Denoting by {yfn} the complex-valued coefficients of the STFT of x(t), where f and n index frequencies and time frames, respectively, the so-called Gaussian Composite Model (GCM) introduced in [3] writes simply\nyfn ∼ Nc(0, [WH]fn), (1)\nwhere Nc refers to the circular complex-valued normal distribution.1 As shown by Eq. (1), in the GCM the STFT is assumed centered (reflecting an equivalent assumption in the time domain which\n∗Authorship based on alphabetical order to reflect an equal contribution. 1A random variable x has distribution Nc(x|µ, λ) = (πλ)−1 exp−(|x− µ|2/λ) if and only if its real and\nimaginary parts are independent and with distribution N(Re(µ), λ/2) and N(Im(µ), λ/2), respectively.\nis valid for many signals such as audio signals) and its variance has a low-rank structure. Under these assumptions, the negative log-likelihood − log p(Y|W,H) of the STFT matrix Y and parameters W and H is equal, up to a constant, to the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence DIS(S|WH) between the power spectrogram S = |Y|2 and WH [3]. The GCM is a step forward from traditional NMF approaches that fail to provide a valid generative model of the STFT itself – other approaches have only considered probabilistic models of the magnitude spectrogram under Poisson or multinomial assumptions, see [1] for a review. Still, the GCM is not yet a generative model of the raw signal x(t) itself, but of its STFT. The work reported in this paper fills in this ultimate gap. It describes a novel signal synthesis model with low-rank time-frequency structure. Besides improved accuracy of representation thanks to modeling at lowest level, our new approach opens doors to multi-resolution representations, that were not possible in the traditional NMF setting. Because of the synthesis approach, we may represent the signal as a sum of layers with their own time resolution, and their own latent low-rank structure.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the new low-rank time-frequency synthesis (LRTFS) model. Section 3 addresses estimation in LRTFS. We present two maximum likelihood estimation approaches with companion EM algorithms. Section 4 describes how LRTFS can be adapted to multiple-resolution representations. Section 5 reports experiments with audio applications, namely music decomposition and speech enhancement. Section 6 concludes."

(2) are assumed complexvalued. In the real case, the hermitian symmetry of the time-frequency (t-f) frame can be exploited: one only needs to consider the atoms relative to positive frequencies, generate the corresponding complex signal and then generate the real signal satisfying the hermitian symmetry on the coefficients. W and H are nonnegative matrices of dimensions F ×K and K ×N , respectively.2 For a fixed t-f point (f, n), the signal φfn = {φfn(t)}t, referred to as atom, is the element of an arbitrary t-f basis, for example a Gabor frame (a collection of tapered oscillating functions with short temporal support). e(t) is an identically and independently distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian residual term. The variables {αfn} are synthesis coefficients, assumed conditionally independent. Loosely speaking, they are dual of the analysis coefficients, defined by yfn = ∑ t x(t)φ ∗ fn(t). The coefficients of the STFT can be interpreted as analysis coefficients obtained with a Gabor frame. The synthesis coefficients are assumed centered, ensuring that x(t) has zero expectation as well. A low-rank latent structure is imposed on their variance. This is in contrast with the GCM introduced at Eq. (1), that instead imposes a low-rank structure on the variance of the analysis coefficients."

(6)\nIgnoring the low-rank constraint, Eqs. (5)-(6) resemble sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), as introduced in [4, 5], where it is shown that marginal likelihood estimation of the variance induces sparse solutions of v and thus α. The essential difference between our model and SBL is that the coefficients are no longer unstructured in LRTFS. Indeed, in SBL, each coefficient αm has a free variance parameter vm. This property is fundamental to the sparsity-inducing effect of SBL [4]. In contrast, in LRTFS, the variances are now tied together and such that vm = vfn = [WH]fn ."

We may introduce independent complex-valued latent components ykfn ∼ Nc(0, wfkhkn) and write yfn = ∑K k=1 ykfn. Marginalizing the components from this simple Gaussian additive model leads to Eq. (1). In this perspective, the GCM implicitly assumes the data STFT Y to be a sum of elementary STFT components Yk = {ykfn}fn . In the GCM, the components can be reconstructed after estimation of W and H , using any statistical estimator. In particular, the minimum mean square estimator (MMSE), given by the posterior mean, reduces to so-called Wiener filtering:\nŷkfn = wfkhkn [WH]fn yfn. (7)\nThe components may then be STFT-inversed to obtain temporal reconstructions that form the output of the overall signal decomposition approach.\nOf course, the same principle applies to LRTFS. The synthesis coefficients αfn may equally be written as a sum of latent components, such that αfn = ∑ k αkfn, with αkfn ∼ Nc(0, wfkhkn). Denoting by αk the column vector of dimension M with coefficients {αkfn}fn, Eq. (5) may be written as\nx = ∑ k Φαk + e = ∑ k ck + e , (8)\nwhere ck = Φαk. The component ck is the “temporal expression” of spectral pattern wk, the kth column of W. Given estimates of W and H, the components may be reconstructed in various way. The equivalent of the Wiener filtering approach used traditionally with the GCM would consist in computing ĉMMSEk = Φα̂ MMSE k , with α̂ MMSE k = E{αk|x,W,H}. Though the expression of α̂ MMSE k is available in closed form it requires the inversion of a too large matrix, of dimensions T × T (see also Section 3.2). We will instead use ĉk = Φα̂k with α̂k = E{αk|α̂,W,H}, where α̂ is the available estimate of α. In this case, the coefficients of α̂k are given by\nα̂kfn = wfkhkn [WH]fn α̂fn. (9)"

The first approach, described in the next section is maximum joint likelihood estimation (MJLE). It relies on the minimization of − log p(x,α|W,H, λ). The second approach is maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE), described in Section 3.2. It relies on the minimization of − log p(x|W,H, λ), i.e., involves the marginalization of α from the joint likelihood, following the principle of SBL. Though we present MMLE for the sake of completeness, our current implementation does not scale with the dimensions involved in the audio signal processing applications presented in Section 5, and large-scale algorithms for MMLE are left as future work."

The first term in Eq. (11) measures the discrepancy between the raw signal and its approximation. The second term ensures that the synthesis coefficients are approximately low-rank. Unexpectedly, a third term that favors sparse solutions of α, thanks to the log function, naturally appears from the derivation of the joint likelihood. The objective function (11) is not convex and the EM algorithm described next may only ensure convergence to a local solution.\nEM algorithm. In order to minimize CJL, we employ an EM algorithm based on the architecture proposed by Figueiredo & Nowak [6]. It consists of rewriting Eq. (5) as\nz = α+ √ β e1 , (12)\nx = Φz + e2 , (13)\nwhere z acts as a hidden variable, e1 ∼ Nc(0, I), e2 ∼ Nc(0, λI − βΦΦ∗), with the operator ·∗ denoting Hermitian transpose. Provided that β ≤ λ/δΦ, where δΦ is the largest eigenvalue of ΦΦ∗, the likelihood function p(x|α, λ) under Eqs. (12)-(13) is the same as under Eq. (5). Denoting the set of parameters by θJL = {α,W,H, λ}, the EM algorithm relies on the iterative minimization of\nQ(θJL|θ̃JL) = − ∫\nz\nlog p(x,α, z|W,H, λ)p(z|x, θ̃JL)dz , (14)\nwhere θ̃JL acts as the current parameter value. Loosely speaking, the EM algorithm relies on the idea that if z was known, then the estimation of α and of the other parameters would boil down to the mere white noise denoising problem described by Eq. (12). As z is not known, the posterior mean value w.r.t z of the joint likelihood is considered instead.\nThe complete likelihood in Eq. (14) may be decomposed as\nlog p(x,α, z|W,H, λ) = log p(x|z, λ) + log p(z|α) + log p(α|WH). (15)\nThe hidden variable posterior simplifies to p(z|x,θJL) = p(z|x, λ). From there, using standard manipulations with Gaussian distributions, the (i + 1)th iteration of the resulting algorithm writes as follows.\nE-step: z(i) = E{z|x, λ(i)} = α(i) + β λ(i) Φ∗(x−Φα(i)) (16)\nM-step: ∀(f, n), α(i+1)fn = v (i) fn\nv (i) fn + β\nz (i) fn (17)\n(W(i+1),H(i+1)) = argmin W,H≥0 ∑ fn DIS ( |α(i+1)fn | 2|[WH]fn )\n(18)\nλ(i+1) = 1\nT ‖x−Φα(i+1)‖2F (19)\nIn Eq. (17), v(i)fn is a shorthand for [W (i)H(i)]fn . Eq. (17) is simply the application of Wiener filtering to Eq. (12) with z = z(i). Eq. (18) amounts to solving a NMF with the IS divergence; it may be solved using majorization-minimization, resulting in the standard multiplicative update rules given in [3]. A local solution might only be obtained with this approach, but this is still decreasing the negative log-likelihood at every iteration. The update rule for λ is not the one that exactly derives from the EM procedure (this one has a more complicated expression), but it still decreases the negative log-likelihood at every iteration as explained in [6].\nNote that the overall algorithm is rather computationally friendly as no matrix inversion is required. The Φα and Φ∗x operations in Eq. (16) correspond to analysis and synthesis operations that can be realized efficiently using optimized packages, such as the Large Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) [7]."

M is typically at least twice larger than T , the signal length. Using the Woodbury matrix identity, the expression of Σ(i) can be reduced to the inversion of a matrix of size T , but this is still too large for most signal processing applications (e.g., 3 min of music sampled at CD quality makes T in the order of 106). As such, we will discard MMLE in the experiments of Section 5 but the methodology presented in this section can be relevant to other problems with smaller dimensions."

      "text" : "Besides the advantage of modeling the raw signal itself, and not its STFT, another major strength of LRTFS is that it offers the possibility of multi-resolution modeling. The latter consists of representing a signal as a sum of t-f atoms with different temporal (and thus frequency) resolutions. This is for example relevant in audio where transients, such as the attacks of musical notes, are much shorter than sustained parts such as the tonal components (the steady, harmonic part of musical notes). Another example is speech where different classes of phonemes can have different resolutions. At even higher level, stationarity of female speech holds at shorter resolution than male speech. Because traditional spectral factorizations approaches work on the transformed data, the time resolution is set once for all at feature computation and cannot be adapted during decomposition.\nIn contrast, LRTFS can accommodate multiple t-f bases in the following way. Assume for simplicity that x is to be expanded on the union of two frames Φa and Φb, with common column size T\nand with t-f grids of sizes Fa × Na and Fb × Nb, respectively. Φa may be for example a Gabor frame with short time resolution and Φb a Gabor frame with larger resolution – such a setting has been considered in many audio applications, e.g., [8, 9], together with sparse synthesis coefficients models.

The proposed algorithm for maximum joint likelihood estimation of the synthesis coefficients and their low-rank variance can be viewed as an iterative shrinkage algorithm with an additional Itakura-Saito NMF penalty term. In [15], Elad explains in the context of sparse representations that soft thresholding of analysis coefficients corresponds to the first iteration of the forwardbackward algorithm for LASSO/basis pursuit denoising. Similarly, Itakura-Saito NMF followed by Wiener filtering correspond to the first iteration of the proposed EM algorithm for MJLE.\nAs opposed to traditional NMF, LRTFS accommodates multi-resolution representations very naturally, with no extra difficulty at the estimation level. The model can be extended in a straightforward manner to various additional penalties on the matrices W or H (such as smoothness or sparsity). Future work will include the design of a scalable algorithm for MMLE, using for example message passing [16], and a comparison of MJLE and MMLE for LRTFS. Moreover, our generative model can be considered for more general inverse problems such as multichannel audio source separation [17].

In particular, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) of the spectrogram – the (power) magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) – has been considered in many audio applications. In this setting, NMF with the Itakura-Saito divergence was shown to underly a generative Gaussian composite model (GCM) of the STFT, a step forward from more empirical approaches based on ad-hoc transform and divergence specifications. Still, the GCM is not yet a generative model of the raw signal itself, but only of its STFT. The work presented in this paper fills in this ultimate gap by proposing a novel signal synthesis model with low-rank time-frequency structure. In particular, our new approach opens doors to multi-resolution representations, that were not possible in the traditional NMF setting. We describe two expectation-maximization algorithms for estimation in the new model and report audio signal processing results with music decomposition and speech enhancement.",
