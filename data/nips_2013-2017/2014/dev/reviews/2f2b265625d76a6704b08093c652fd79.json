{"title": "Spike Frequency Adaptation Implements Anticipative Tracking in Continuous Attractor Neural Networks", "abstract": "To extract motion information, the brain needs to compensate for time delays that are ubiquitous in neural signal transmission and processing. Here we propose a simple yet effective mechanism to implement anticipative tracking in neural systems. The proposed mechanism utilizes the property of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA), a feature widely observed in neuronal responses. We employ continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) as the model to describe the tracking behaviors in neural systems. Incorporating SFA, a CANN exhibits intrinsic mobility, manifested by the ability of the CANN to hold self-sustained travelling waves. In tracking a moving stimulus, the interplay between the external drive and the intrinsic mobility of the network determines the tracking performance. Interestingly, we find that the regime of anticipation effectively coincides with the regime where the intrinsic speed of the travelling wave exceeds that of the external drive. Depending on the SFA amplitudes, the network can achieve either perfect tracking, with zero-lag to the input, or perfect anticipative tracking, with a constant leading time to the input. Our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed anticipative tracking behaviors, and sheds light on our understanding of how the brain processes motion information in a timely manner.", "id": "2f2b265625d76a6704b08093c652fd79", "authors": ["Yuanyuan Mi", "C.

The authors show that spike frequency adaptation (SFA) can induce traveling waves under certain conditions. Interestingly, they show that the effects induced by SFA are similar to those that can be obtained by introducing asymmetric coupling between neurons as in [14], with the advantage that this method does not depend on hard-wired connections. The bulk of the paper is a theoretical analysis of a simplified model and simulations with the complete model for verification.

In brief, the authors show that spike frequency adaptation is a sufficient condition to induce travelling waves (moving bump attractors). These provide a plausible explanation for anticipatory dynamics when entrained by exogenous input. The notion is that these dynamics may provide a solution to sensorimotor delay problems in the real brain. \n\nCOMMENTS TO AUTHORS\n\nI enjoyed reading this clearly described and well-motivated treatment of continuous attractor networks (and wave equations) in the context of anticipatory dynamics in neuronal networks. I have a few minor points that might improve the presentation of your ideas. \n \n1)\tIt might be nice to refer to predictive coding as a popular framework for understanding active vision and inference that necessarily rests upon some form of prediction and, implicitly, anticipation in the context of oculomotor delays. In this context, your contribution provides a nice and biologically plausible way of finessing the oculomotor delay problem that could \u2013 in principle \u2013 be absorbed into an inference scheme using Bayesian filtering? \n\n2)\tOn line 53, replace \u201cthese supporting evidence\u201d with \u201cthis supporting evidence\u201d. \n\n3)\tOn line 101, I would say \u201cwhich is generally assumed to have the following form\u201d:\n\n4)\tIt would be nice to supplement Figure 1 with the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric interaction kernels (Equations 4 and 5) to give the reader a fuller intuition about the asymmetry. \n\n5)\tIn section 2.3, there may be an important difference between the asymmetric neural networks and the \u201csymmetry breaking\u201d afforded by spike frequency adaptation. I am not sure but the direction of the travelling wave in the asymmetric formulation is pre-determined by the asymmetry in the spatial interaction kernel. If this is the case, then you could say something like:\n\n\u201cNote that both SFA and asymmetric coupling destroy the stability of stationary bump attractors; however, SFA admits moving solutions in either direction. This should be contrasted with the asymmetric coupling implementation; in which the direction of motion is determined by the form of the asymmetry. This could be potentially important in terms of tracking behaviour - in which targets can move in either direction.\u201d\n\n6)\tI would move Figure 2 to after you have introduced Equation 13 and have defined intrinsic velocity.\n\n7)\tIn Equation 12, I would either replace u with phi or phi with u in the line below to make it clear that these are both the principal eigenmodes.\n\n8)\tOn line 305, replace \u201cgives to\u201d with \u201cgives\u201d.\n\nI hope that these comments help should any revision be required.\n This was a compelling demonstration of the utility of spike frequency adaptation in neural field models of travelling waves \u2013 that may play a useful role in anticipating or tracking.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper uses spike frequency adaptation (SFA) to implement anticipative tracking in a Continuous Attractor Neural Network (CANN). \n Anticipative tracking is interesting because the neural delays in actually perceiving a moving object mean that all our perceptions lag reality.\n Here the authors show that SFA allows for anticipative tracking over a wide range of velocities\n \n The paper is clearly written, to my knowledge the results are novel, interesting, and the performance seems good.\n\t I recommend including the paper in the proceedings.\n  The paper is clearly written, to my knowledge the results are novel, interesting, and the performance seems good.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
