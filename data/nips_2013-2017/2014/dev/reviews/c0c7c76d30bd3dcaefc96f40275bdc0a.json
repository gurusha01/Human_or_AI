{"title": "Zeta Hull Pursuits: Learning Nonconvex Data Hulls", "abstract": "Selecting a small informative subset from a given dataset, also called column sampling, has drawn much attention in machine learning. For incorporating structured data information into column sampling, research efforts were devoted to the cases where data points are fitted with clusters, simplices, or general convex hulls. This paper aims to study nonconvex hull learning which has rarely been investigated in the literature. In order to learn data-adaptive nonconvex hulls, a novel approach is proposed based on a graph-theoretic measure that leverages graph cycles to characterize the structural complexities of input data points. Employing this measure, we present a greedy algorithmic framework, dubbed Zeta Hulls, to perform structured column sampling. The process of pursuing a Zeta hull involves the computation of matrix inverse. To accelerate the matrix inversion computation and reduce its space complexity as well, we exploit a low-rank approximation to the graph adjacency matrix by using an efficient anchor graph technique. Extensive experimental results show that data representation learned by Zeta Hulls can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in text and image classification tasks.", "id": "c0c7c76d30bd3dcaefc96f40275bdc0a", "authors": ["Yuanjun Xiong", "Wei Liu", "Deli Zhao", "Xiaoou Tang"], "conference": "NIPS2014", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The paper presents a novel approach for column sampling when the data point clusters comprise of non-convex hulls. Column sampling is important in selecting a small subset of data that represents the properties of the original dataset. The presented approach is based upon the computation of Zeta hulls. The authors model the graph cycles by means of the sum-product rule and integrate them using the Zeta function. The authors set up the optimization problem as finding the subset of points with the strongest point extremenesses. The authors also present a scalable algorithm to solve the problem using the anchor graph method which allows the original weighted graph to be reconstructed from a small set of anchors. The authors then perform a low rank approximation of the anchor graph for scalability purpose. The paper also analyzes the time and space complexity. \nThe authors evaluate their methodology on synthetic as well as real data from text and image classification. They use several state of the art baseline methods to compare the performance of their model. Their results show that their method outperforms the baseline methods.  The paper provides a novel approach to perform column sampling using Zeta hull pursuits. The authors show promising performance improvements using several baseline methods on real data.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "This paper presents a method for non-convex hull learning, with the goal of selecting a small set of representative instances from a dataset (column sampling). The core idea is to select points on the hull based on structural complexity scores of the graph computing using zeta functions. Since naive application of this process involves a matrix inversion, the authors also propose extension based on anchor graphs. The paper is fairly well written, and the proposed idea seems novel. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the technique.\n\nI wonder whether the authors have though have robustness of the algorithm to noise/outliers. It seems the algorithm will pick those up even though they are not ideal for column sampling. Secondly, I wonder how the proposed technique relates to DPPs (http://www.nowpublishers.com/articles/foundations-and-trends-in-machine-learning/MAL-044) which also focus on subset selection, although with diversity in mind. It will be very informative to learn about any relationship.\n\n This paper presents a method for column sampling based on non-convex hull learning using zeta functions. The paper should be of interest to the NIPS community, although inclusion of relationship to other subset selection techniques such as DPP will strengthen the paper.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "\"Zeta Hull Pursuits: Learning Non-convex Data Hulls\" addresses the problem of column sampling in datasets by finding points that do not alter significantly the Ihara zeta function of a graph (presumably constructed via a kernel). They provide establish some basic facts about the zeta function and the effect that removing a vertex has on it. These they use to provide a fast greedy algorithm for selecting 'outlying' vertices, and a faster version using anchors. They demonstrate on some standard datasets that using these points can improve classification accuracy. \n\nThe paper is fairly well written, with good organization and only minor typos. I have checked the proofs and did not find any mistakes. I am not sure that the method is motivated enough to merit acceptance, while it is in fact a novel idea.\n\nThe authors elude to the fact that this works for summarization of the data points without assuming that they are preserving the convex hull or enscribing ellipsoids. I believe that this is the primary merit of this paper, that they are able to find representative points in a combinatorial fashion. With that said, it is not exactly clear what is the motivation behind the use of the zeta function. If they had clearly argued for the use of points that minimize their epsilon objective, perhaps via the learning of non-convex hulls (which was never clearly defined) then my review might be better.\n\nAlso, I don't think that the Theorems are significant enough technical contributions to merit much attention. Theorem 1 reiterates an established fact regarding the a determinant form of the Zeta function (generalized to weighted graphs). Theorems 2 and 3 are straightforward results from matrix algebra and the SVD.\n\n The paper is well written and organized and the method is novel. However, I do not believe that the use of the method is well defended and motivated by this paper.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
