The work is motivated by the observation that odorant molecules are sparsely represented\nby the population of Kenyon cells. The authors first mathematically formulate the olfactory system as a MAP\ndecoder, and give the standard solution to the problem without considering biological constraints. Next, to\nmake the solution more biologically plausible, the authors reformulate the olfactory system model as a decoder\nof a compressive sensing problem, and provide two standard solutions to the dual problem. Then, the authors\nargue that each of the components in the solution can be mapped/interpreted to/as a unit of the biological\nstructure in the olfactory system. However, these maps are described without a strong justification\nand there are conceptual problems in linking the math with the biology.\n\nFurther clarification on the following points would help readers to gain better insights:\n\n- While LNs and KCs are modeled using a Heaviside function, modeling that is widely accepted in the literature,\nthe PNs output is modeled as the Lagrange multiplier. Such modeling is not intuitive, and needs to be justified.\nIn particular, under such modeling, the output of PNs is computed by the gradient decent method in Eq. (10) for\nthe full dual algorithm, and in Eq. (16) for the reduced dual, which would require iteration to reach an optimal\nsolution. However, it is not clear how PNs perform the gradient decent method and the iteration mechanism.\nThe major problem, however, is that the solution to eq. (10) might be negative and the PN output rate (lambda)\nhas to be positive!\n\n- The B matrix is proposed to replace the A matrix so that the role of LNs can be accommodated into the solution.\nHowever, it is not clear why the solution to Eq. (12) (with the B matrix) is the same as the solution to (10) (with the\nA matrix). It needs to be shown that the lambda computed by Eq. (12) converges to the one computed by Eq. (10).\nAlso, the B matrix is square, implicitly indicating that the numbers of the PNs and LNs is the same. However, this is\nnot true since there are more PNs than LNs. What would be the performance of the reduced dual circuit if the B matrix\nis not square but rectangular, and the ratio of its two dimensions follows the ratio of the numbers of LNs and PNs?\n\n- More on the B matrix. The B matrix is not fixed, and needs to be learned every time a new input is given. As shown\nin Fig 3, the proposed method can not always learn the B matrix faithfully. What is the performance of the reduced dual\ncircuit when the B matrix is poorly learned? Furthermore, B needs to be learned before being used for readout by KCs.\nAlthough, the authors depicted a procedure to deal with this issue of combing learning and readout, there is neither a\njustification nor simulations of such a procedure, and it is hard to evaluate its correctness.\n\nFinally, the authors suggest that the connectivity between the PNs and the KCs is, at least structurally, related to the A\nmatrix. Now, in the recently published article: Caron, S.J.C, Ruta, V., Abbott, L.F. and Axel, R. (2013) Random Convergence\nof Afferent Olfactory Inputs in the Drosophila Mushroom Body. Nature 497:113-117, it is argued that the same connectivity\nis random. Is there a reason to believe that this does not also apply to the locust?\n\nOriginality:\nAttempting to bridge an optimization method to the neural circuit of insect's olfactory system.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper seems at times to be prepared in a rush. The main message is not clear at the first glance.\n\nQuality:\nThe authors need to demonstrate that the mapping between the sparse optimization solution and neural circuit makes sense,\nand the proposed methods indeed solve the decoding problem. \n\nNotes:\nline 43: continuosly -> continuously\nline 155: multpliers -> multipliers\nline 233: inhibtory -> inhibitory\nline 234: odor-evoekd -> odor-evoked\nline 259: hte -> the\nline 314: intepreted -> interpreted\nline 348: perfomance -> performance, in correct -> incorrect\nline 351: (B) -> (C)\nline 352: matrics -> matrices\nline 398: out performs -> outperforms\nline 418: alotted -> allotted\n The paper falls short both from a mathematical point of view and from the questionable linking of the math with the biology.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "NOTE: Due to the range in reviews, we were asked to discuss this paper. As a result of that discussion, we'd like the authors to address the three following points:\n\n1) How are the firing rates (or some other physiological measure of activity) mapped to the variables y and in particular lambda. Lambda - in the current formulation - has no bounds. How does this affect the interpretation. \n\n2) There is a need for \"negative reciprocal\" connectivity between the PNs and LNs (this comes out of the use of B and B_transpose) in Equation 12. Similarly there is a need for the same symmetry between the measurements of the sparse vector x and the projections up to the KCs. Is there evidence of this symmetry in the locus anatomy or physiology? Can the model work without it? \n\n3) So far the main evidence that this model describes the olfactory circuit in locust is that the odor input is sparse in terms of molecules per input, somewhere along the way the sparse signal is measured by the A matrix such that it is projected into a lower-dimensional, denser representation. (It should be clarified where this happens... we believe it happens on the level of the ORs such that each OR responds to several molecules and each molecule binds with several ORs). Then there is some processing in this lower-dimension via the B matrix (PNs and LNs) which is then projected back up into a higher-dimension through A to the KCs. We feel that while there is some structure of the biological circuit in the model, this paper needs to provide more evidence. Is there evidence of gradient descent dynamics? Is there evidence in the plasticity/processing between LNs and PNs that can be mapped to the form of ICA presented here? \n\nTHE TEXT BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nFirstly, I love seeing a theoretical paper which attempts to model a very particular circuit. Typically, we see attempts to create general neural networks or to formally characterize systems which are not well characterized from a biological/experimental point of view. Here we have the opposite, which seems like a more fruitful approach, that is if one's goal is to understand nervous systems.\n\nIn this paper, the authors derive a mathematical model of processing in the locust olfactory system. The input is a bit vector representing an odor where each entry encodes the presence or absence of particular molecules. Because many ORNs each with the same OR converge on a single glomeruli, the input can be taken as noise-free. In the low-dimensional glomerular layer, the mixed signals from the ORNs interact with each other via local interneurons and PNs. Finally, the PNs then project up into the higher-dimensional space of KCs where each KC codes for a particular molecule in the input.\n\nThe authors first describe the problem of recovering the sparse, high-dimensional input via the KCs as a MAP optimization, but then reformulate the problem in the compressed sensing context. Next, the dual of the compressed sensing problem is presented as a model since it can more easily be interpreted in terms of the locust nervous system. This model is then changed again to further take knowledge about the biological circuit into account by ensuring that any dynamics happen on the M-dimensional signal. This requires the circuit to learn an M-dimensional subspace of the full N-dimensional space to operate in which is implemented using ICA.\n\nThis paper is highly original in the way it brings together the compressed sensing problem, ICA, and a particular neural circuit. Also, the presentation of the model is clear and easy to follow. However, I would like a clearer explanation of the biological circuit and how it maps back to the model. Is it that each OR can bind with several molecules such that the glomeruli each represent a mixture of molecules? Then the PNs readout the glomeruli and also take part in the dynamics which ultimately allows the readout by the KCs which sample a mixture of PNs? The basic question is where exactly does the mixing happen. After reading this paper and reviewing references, I'm still not completely certain. I think where I get lost is whether each OR binds with several or only one molecule. It would be helpful to really nail down how the model and biology map to each other since this paper's strongest aspect is that it models a particular circuit. Maybe to make room you can condense the sections where you present models that are ultimately not used.\n\nAs it stands, the current model is very interesting and I believe that with some clarifiations it is motivated by the biology. However, the real key to making this a significant paper would be to show that the dynamics of the model (either the gradient descent dynamics or something about the ICA dynamics) match the dynamics of the true circuit. So far you've shown that this model can perform sparse regression/compressed sensing and that it has some structural similarities to the biological circuit. I'd like to see a figure that compares a simulation of this model with the true circuit even if it's only that individual neuron's responses match physiological data. Or maybe there is evidence of an ICA implementation in the locust olfactory system? Do they dynamics of ICA seem comparable to any behavioral measurements from locust? Or maybe the ability to discriminate odors wouldl show that performance was more like the reduced dual than the full dual circuit? I would love to see something like this addressed in a revised version of this paper or in a future paper. This paper presents a novel model for a particular circuit - the locust olfactory circuit - which combines ideas from compressed sensing and ICA. While stronger evidence that this model in fact captures the physiology of the biological circuit would greatly increase the significance of the work, it would still be of interest to the NIPS community as it stands.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "Summary:\n\nThe authors study the olfaction circuit in the locust. They propose that KC neurons reconstruct estimates of odor vectors via dynamics in the antennal lobe. Specifically, they propose that LN-PN connections are updated via ICA, while the PN dynamics are determined by gradient descent of the dual of a compressed-sensing optimization problem.\n\nThey show performance of this \"reduced dual\" circuit offers reasonable performance compared to a simple feedforward circuit.\n\nQuality:\n\nThe reduced dual circuit is an intriguing hypothesis. If true this would be an exceptional paper. The mathematical development flows from 1) basic MAP inference for identifying odors to 2) low-dimensional dynamics of the problem's dual to 3) the reduced dual circuit and finally to 4) learning LN representations by ICA. This step-by-step development is elegant and is thus very appealing.\n\nHowever, the plausibility of this hypothesis does not seem sufficiently explored. The paper contains no compelling comparisons to biological data. PN neurons are known to exhibit transient dynamics in response to odors. Do the dynamics of eqn 12 yield sensible dynamical trajectories? Can anything be said about physiological/behavioral adaptations of locusts to new odor environments -- and whether such experimental observations comply with expectations of eqn 16? If no such data are available, it would be useful to discuss which expectations of the reduced dual circuit can be tested with existing data and which are currently hypothetical. Overall, these concerns are underdeveloped in the paper.\n\nWhat is the motivation to focus specifically on the locust? It seems that the locust is only constraining the choice of M and N. \n\nThe paper has one unfinished figure (line 294)\n\nClarity:\n\nIn section 4 some notation is confusing. x is overloaded to represent both the odor vector and the KC estimate of the odor. I believe this is motivated by developing the general mathematical result first and adding biological mappings later, but it was slightly confusing. Another example: A represents both the ORN->glom map and the PN->KC map.\n\nOtherwise the paper is clear and well-written.\n\nOriginality:\n\nTo my knowledge this is an especially original paper.\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe significance of this study seems to rely on experimental verification. Conditioned on that, I think it has potential to be a high-impact paper.\n Simple biological constraints motivate an alternative formulation for a standard optimization problem (compressed sensing) in locust olfaction. The development of these ideas is elegant, but the paper would be strengthened by verifying expectations of the model with current experimental data.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper proposed an inferential and read-out circuit model for decoding odor in locusts. In this circuit, the PN and LN neurons in the antennal lobe engage in inferential computation and the Kanyon cells in the mushroom body perform read-out of the distinct odors. Biological data were taken into consideration in the development of a mathematical model of the circuit's computation, leading to the formulation of the reduced dual circuit, which uses a recurrent circuit between PN cells (lambda), glomerulus activity (y) and LN neurons, which implement the B matrix, to infer and represent the odor in distributed form. The projection from PN activity to KC allows the odor to be read out in sparse representation, with one KC represents roughly one or a few odors. Although some of these ideas about the olfactory circuit have been suggested earlier by G. Laurent and colleagues. This might be the first time the entire computational circuit is put together and mapped into a plausible functional and mathematical form. The insight of using PN and LN cells in recurrent circuit to perform inference is forced by a serious consideration of the biological facts. This model thus provides significant insight into our understanding of olfactory computation, with a fairly plausible and rigorous mathematical framework. The hypothetical connections from LN to PN and their relationship to the projection from PN to KC also provides concrete testable predictions of the model. While parts of this dense paper might need clarification, the work is original and important.

It provides deep insight into the computations of the olfactory circuits.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
