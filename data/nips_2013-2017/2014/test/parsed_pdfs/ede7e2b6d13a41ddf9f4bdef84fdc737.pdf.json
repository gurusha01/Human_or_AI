      "text" : "Remarkably, recent advances [1, 2] have shown that it is possible to minimise strongly convex finite sums provably faster in expectation than is possible without the finite sum structure. This is significant for machine learning problems as a finite sum structure is common in the empirical risk minimisation setting. The requirement of strong convexity is likewise satisfied in machine learning problems in the typical case where a quadratic regulariser is used.\nIn particular, we are interested in minimising functions of the form\nf(x) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 fi(x),\nwhere x ∈ Rd, each fi is convex and has Lipschitz continuous derivatives with constant L. We will also consider the case where each fi is strongly convex with constant µ, and the “composite” (or proximal) case where an additional regularisation function is added:\nF (x) = f(x) + h(x),\nwhere h : Rd → Rd is convex but potentially non-differentiable, and where the proximal operation of h is easy to compute — few incremental gradient methods are applicable in this setting [3][4].\nOur contributions are as follows. In Section 2 we describe the SAGA algorithm, a novel incremental gradient method. In Section 5 we prove theoretical convergence rates for SAGA in the strongly convex case better than those for SAG [1] and SVRG [5], and a factor of 2 from the SDCA [2] convergence rates. These rates also hold in the composite setting. Additionally, we show that ∗The first author completed this work while under funding from NICTA.

We establish theoretical convergence rates for this case also. In Section 3 we discuss the relation between each of the fast incremental gradient methods, showing that each stems from a very small modification of another."

      "text" : "We start with some known initial vector x0 ∈ Rd and known derivatives f ′i(φ0i ) ∈ Rd with φ0i = x0 for each i. These derivatives are stored in a table data-structure of length n, or alternatively a n× d matrix. For many problems of interest, such as binary classification and least-squares, only a single floating point value instead of a full gradient vector needs to be stored (see Section 4). SAGA is inspired both from SAG [1] and SVRG [5] (as we will discuss in Section 3). SAGA uses a step size of γ and makes the following updates, starting with k = 0:\nSAGA Algorithm: Given the value of xk and of each f ′i(φki ) at the end of iteration k, the updates for iteration k + 1 is as follows:\n1. Pick a j uniformly at random.\n2. Take φk+1j = x k, and store f ′j(φ k+1 j ) in the table. All other entries in the table remain\nunchanged. The quantity φk+1j is not explicitly stored.\n3. Update x using f ′j(φ k+1 j ), f ′ j(φ k j ) and the table average: wk+1 = xk − γ [ f ′j(φ k+1 j )− f ′j(φkj ) + 1\nn n∑ i=1 f ′i(φ k i )\n] , (1)\nxk+1 = proxhγ ( wk+1 ) . (2)\nThe proximal operator we use above is defined as\nproxhγ (y) := argmin x∈Rd\n{ h(x) + 1\n2γ ‖x− y‖2\n} . (3)\nIn the strongly convex case, when a step size of γ = 1/(2(µn+L)) is chosen, we have the following convergence rate in the composite and hence also the non-composite case:\nE ∥∥∥xk − x∗∥∥∥2 ≤ (1− µ\n2(µn+ L) )k [∥∥x0 − x∗∥∥2 + n µn+ L [ f(x0)− 〈 f ′(x∗), x0 − x∗ 〉 − f(x∗) ]] .\nWe prove this result in Section 5. The requirement of strong convexity can be relaxed from needing to hold for each fi to just holding on average, but at the expense of a worse geometric rate (1 −\nµ 6(µn+L) ), requiring a step size of γ = 1/(3(µn+ L)).\nIn the non-strongly convex case, we have established the convergence rate in terms of the average iterate, excluding step 0: x̄k = 1k ∑k t=1 x t. Using a step size of γ = 1/(3L) we have\nE [ F (x̄k) ] − F (x∗) ≤ 4n\nk\n[ 2L\nn ∥∥x0 − x∗∥∥2 + f(x0)− 〈f ′(x∗), x0 − x∗〉− f(x∗)] . This result is proved in the supplementary material. Importantly, when this step size γ = 1/(3L) is used, our algorithm automatically adapts to the level of strong convexity µ > 0 naturally present, giving a convergence rate of (see the comment at the end of the proof of Theorem 1):\nE ∥∥∥xk − x∗∥∥∥2 ≤ (1−min{ 1\n4n , µ 3L })k [∥∥x0 − x∗∥∥2 + 2n 3L [ f(x0)− 〈 f ′(x∗), x0 − x∗ 〉 − f(x∗) ]] .\nAlthough any incremental gradient method can be applied to non-strongly convex problems via the addition of a small quadratic regularisation, the amount of regularisation is an additional tunable parameter which our method avoids."

      "text" : "We explore the relationship between SAGA and the other fast incremental gradient methods in this section. By using SAGA as a midpoint, we are able to provide a more unified view than is available in the existing literature. A brief summary of the properties of each method considered in this section is given in Figure 1. The method from [3], which handles the non-composite setting, is not listed as its rate is of the slow type and can be up to n times smaller than the one for SAGA or SVRG [5].\nSAGA: midpoint between SAG and SVRG/S2GD\nIn [5], the authors make the observation that the variance of the standard stochastic gradient (SGD) update direction can only go to zero if decreasing step sizes are used, thus preventing a linear convergence rate unlike for batch gradient descent. They thus propose to use a variance reduction approach (see [7] and references therein for example) on the SGD update in order to be able to use constant step sizes and get a linear convergence rate. We present the updates of their method called SVRG (Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient) in (6) below, comparing it with the non-composite form of SAGA rewritten in (5). They also mention that SAG (Stochastic Average Gradient) [1] can be interpreted as reducing the variance, though they do not provide the specifics. Here, we make this connection clearer and relate it to SAGA.\nWe first review a slightly more generalized version of the variance reduction approach (we allow the updates to be biased). Suppose that we want to use Monte Carlo samples to estimate EX and that we can compute efficiently EY for another random variable Y that is highly correlated with X . One variance reduction approach is to use the following estimator θα as an approximation to EX: θα := α(X−Y )+EY , for a step size α ∈ [0, 1]. We have that Eθα is a convex combination of EX and EY : Eθα = αEX + (1− α)EY . The standard variance reduction approach uses α = 1 and the estimate is unbiased Eθ1 = EX . The variance of θα is: Var(θα) = α2[Var(X) + Var(Y )− 2 Cov(X,Y )], and so if Cov(X,Y ) is big enough, the variance of θα is reduced compared to X , giving the method its name. By varying α from 0 to 1, we increase the variance of θα towards its maximum value (which usually is still smaller than the one for X) while decreasing its bias towards zero.\nBoth SAGA and SAG can be derived from such a variance reduction viewpoint: here X is the SGD direction sample f ′j(x k), whereas Y is a past stored gradient f ′j(φ k j ). SAG is obtained by using α = 1/n (update rewritten in our notation in (4)), whereas SAGA is the unbiased version with α = 1 (see (5) below). For the same φ’s, the variance of the SAG update is 1/n2 times the one of SAGA, but at the expense of having a non-zero bias. This non-zero bias might explain the complexity of the convergence proof of SAG and why the theory has not yet been extended to proximal operators. By using an unbiased update in SAGA, we are able to obtain a simple and tight theory, with better constants than SAG, as well as theoretical rates for the use of proximal operators.\n(SAG) xk+1 = xk − γ [ f ′j(x\nk)− f ′j(φkj ) n + 1 n n∑ i=1 f ′i(φ k i )\n] , (4)\n(SAGA) xk+1 = xk − γ [ f ′j(x k)− f ′j(φkj ) + 1\nn n∑ i=1 f ′i(φ k i )\n] , (5)\n(SVRG) xk+1 = xk − γ [ f ′j(x k)− f ′j(x̃) + 1\nn n∑ i=1 f ′i(x̃)\n] . (6)\nThe SVRG update (6) is obtained by using Y = f ′j(x̃) with α = 1 (and is thus unbiased – we note that SAG is the only method that we present in the related work that has a biased update direction). The vector x̃ is not updated every step, but rather the loop over k appears inside an outer loop, where x̃ is updated at the start of each outer iteration. Essentially SAGA is at the midpoint between SVRG and SAG; it updates the φj value each time index j is picked, whereas SVRG updates all of φ’s as a batch. The S2GD method [8] has the same update as SVRG, just differing in how the number of inner loop iterations is chosen. We use SVRG henceforth to refer to both methods.\nSVRG makes a trade-off between time and space. For the equivalent practical convergence rate it makes 2x-3x more gradient evaluations, but in doing so it does not need to store a table of gradients, but a single average gradient. The usage of SAG vs. SVRG is problem dependent. For example for linear predictors where gradients can be stored as a reduced vector of dimension p− 1 for p classes, SAGA is preferred over SVRG both theoretically and in practice. For neural networks, where no theory is available for either method, the storage of gradients is generally more expensive than the additional backpropagations, but this is computer architecture dependent.\nSVRG also has an additional parameter besides step size that needs to be set, namely the number of iterations per inner loop (m). This parameter can be set via the theory, or conservatively as m = n, however doing so does not give anywhere near the best practical performance. Having to tune one parameter instead of two is a practical advantage for SAGA.\nFinito/MISOµ\nTo make the relationship with other prior methods more apparent, we can rewrite the SAGA algorithm (in the non-composite case) in term of an additional intermediate quantity uk, with u0 := x0 + γ ∑n i=1 f ′ i(x 0), in addition to the usual xk iterate as described previously:\nSAGA: Equivalent reformulation for non-composite case: Given the value of uk and of each f ′i(φ k i ) at the end of iteration k, the updates for iteration k + 1, is as follows:\n1. Calculate xk: xk = uk − γ n∑ i=1 f ′i(φ k i ). (7)\n2. Update u with uk+1 = uk + 1n (x k − uk).\n3. Pick a j uniformly at random.\n4. Take φk+1j = x k, and store f ′j(φ k+1 j ) in the table replacing f ′ j(φ k j ). All other entries in\nthe table remain unchanged. The quantity φk+1j is not explicitly stored.\nEliminating uk recovers the update (5) for xk. We now describe how the Finito [9] and MISOµ [10] methods are closely related to SAGA. Both Finito and MISOµ use updates of the following form, for a step length γ:\nxk+1 = 1\nn ∑ i φki − γ n∑ i=1 f ′i(φ k i ). (8)\nThe step size used is of the order of 1/µn. To simplify the discussion of this algorithm we will introduce the notation φ̄ = 1n ∑ i φ k i .\nSAGA can be interpreted as Finito, but with the quantity φ̄ replaced with u, which is updated in the same way as φ̄, but in expectation. To see this, consider how φ̄ changes in expectation:\nE [ φ̄k+1 ] = E [ φ̄k + 1\nn\n( xk − φkj )] = φ̄k + 1\nn\n( xk − φ̄k ) .\nThe update is identical in expectation to the update for u, uk+1 = uk + 1n (x k − uk). There are three advantages of SAGA over Finito/MISOµ. SAGA does not require strong convexity to work, it has support for proximal operators, and it does not require storing the φi values. MISO has proven support for proximal operators only in the case where impractically small step sizes are used [10]. The big advantage of Finito/MISOµ is that when using a per-pass re-permuted access ordering, empirical speed-ups of up-to a factor of 2x has been observed. This access order can also be used with the other methods discussed, but with smaller empirical speed-ups. Finito/MISOµ is particularly useful when fi is computationally expensive to compute compared to the extra storage costs required over the other methods.\nSDCA\nThe Stochastic Dual Coordinate Descent (SDCA) [2] method on the surface appears quite different from the other methods considered. It works with the convex conjugates of the fi functions. However, in this section we show a novel transformation of SDCA into an equivalent method that only works with primal quantities, and is closely related to the MISOµ method.\nConsider the following algorithm:\nSDCA algorithm in the primal Step k + 1:\n1. Pick an index j uniformly at random.\n2. Compute φk+1j = prox fj γ (z), where γ = 1µn and z = −γ ∑n i6=j f ′ i(φ k i ).\n3. Store the gradient f ′j(φ k+1 j ) = 1 γ ( z − φk+1j ) in the table at location j. For i 6= j, the\ntable entries are unchanged (f ′i(φ k+1 i ) = f ′ i(φ k i )).\nAt completion, return xk = −γ∑ni f ′i(φki ) . We claim that this algorithm is equivalent to the version of SDCA where exact block-coordinate maximisation is used on the dual.1 Firstly, note that while SDCA was originally described for onedimensional outputs (binary classification or regression), it has been expanded to cover the multiclass predictor case [11] (called Prox-SDCA there). In this case, the primal objective has a separate strongly convex regulariser, and the functions fi are restricted to the form fi(x) := ψi(XTi x), where Xi is a d×p feature matrix, and ψi is the loss function that takes a p dimensional input, for p classes. To stay in the same general setting as the other incremental gradient methods, we work directly with the fi(x) functions rather than the more structured ψi(XTi x). The dual objective to maximise then becomes\nD(α) = −µ 2 ∥∥∥∥∥ 1µn n∑ i=1 αi ∥∥∥∥∥ 2 − 1 n n∑ i=1 f∗i (−αi)  , where αi’s are d-dimensional dual variables. Generalising the exact block-coordinate maximisation update that SDCA performs to this form, we get the dual update for block j (with xk the current primal iterate):\nαk+1j = α k j + argmax\n∆aj∈Rd\n{ −f∗j ( −αkj −∆αj ) − µn\n2 ∥∥∥∥xk + 1µn∆αj ∥∥∥∥2 } . (9)\nIn the special case where fi(x) = ψi(XTi x), we can see that (9) gives exactly the same update as Option I of Prox-SDCA in [11, Figure 1], which operates instead on the equivalent p-dimensional dual variables α̃i with the relationship that αi = Xiα̃i.2 As noted by Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang [11], the update (9) is actually an instance of the proximal operator of the convex conjugate of fj . Our primal formulation exploits this fact by using a relation between the proximal operator of a function and its convex conjugate known as the Moreau decomposition:\nproxf ∗ (v) = v − proxf (v).\nThis decomposition allows us to compute the proximal operator of the conjugate via the primal proximal operator. As this is the only use in the basic SDCA method of the conjugate function, applying this decomposition allows us to completely eliminate the “dual” aspect of the algorithm, yielding the above primal form of SDCA. The dual variables are related to the primal representatives φi’s through αi = −f ′i(φi). The KKT conditions ensure that if the αi values are dual optimal then xk = γ ∑ i αi as defined above is primal optimal. The same trick is commonly used to interpret Dijkstra’s set intersection as a primal algorithm instead of a dual block coordinate descent algorithm [12].\nThe primal form of SDCA differs from the other incremental gradient methods described in this section in that it assumes strong convexity is induced by a separate strongly convex regulariser, rather than each fi being strongly convex. In fact, SDCA can be modified to work without a separate regulariser, giving a method that is at the midpoint between Finito and SDCA. We detail such a method in the supplementary material.\n1More precisely, to Option I of Prox-SDCA as described in [11, Figure 1]. We will simply refer to this method as “SDCA” in this paper for brevity.\n2This is because f∗i (αi) = inf α̃i s.t. αi=Xiα̃i ψ∗i (α̃i).\nSDCA variants\nThe SDCA theory has been expanded to cover a number of other methods of performing the coordinate step [11]. These variants replace the proximal operation in our primal interpretation in the previous section with an update where φk+1j is chosen so that: f ′ j(φ k+1 j ) = (1−β)f ′j(φkj )+βf ′j(xk),\nwhere xk = − 1µn ∑ i f ′ i(φ k i ). The variants differ in how β ∈ [0, 1] is chosen. Note that φk+1j does not actually have to be explicitly known, just the gradient f ′j(φ k+1 j ), which is the result of the above interpolation. Variant 5 by Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang [11] does not require operations on the conjugate function, it simply uses β = µnL+µn . The most practical variant performs a line search involving the convex conjugate to determine β. As far as we are aware, there is no simple primal equivalent of this line search. So in cases where we can not compute the proximal operator from the standard SDCA variant, we can either introduce a tuneable parameter into the algorithm (β), or use a dual line search, which requires an efficient way to evaluate the convex conjugates of each fi."

      "text" : "We briefly discuss some implementation concerns:\n• For many problems each derivative f ′i is just a simple weighting of the ith data vector. Logistic regression and least squares have this property. In such cases, instead of storing the full derivative f ′i for each i, we need only to store the weighting constants. This reduces the storage requirements to be the same as the SDCA method in practice. A similar trick can be applied to multi-class classifiers with p classes by storing p− 1 values for each i.\n• Our algorithm assumes that initial gradients are known for each fi at the starting point x0. Instead, a heuristic may be used where during the first pass, data-points are introduced oneby-one, in a non-randomized order, with averages computed in terms of those data-points processed so far. This procedure has been successfully used with SAG [1].\n• The SAGA update as stated is slower than necessary when derivatives are sparse. A just-intime updating of u or x may be performed just as is suggested for SAG [1], which ensures that only sparse updates are done at each iteration.\n• We give the form of SAGA for the case where each fi is strongly convex. However in practice we usually have only convex fi, with strong convexity in f induced by the addition of a quadratic regulariser. This quadratic regulariser may be split amongst the fi functions evenly, to satisfy our assumptions. It is perhaps easier to use a variant of SAGA where the regulariser µ2 ||x||2 is explicit, such as the following modification of Equation (5):\nxk+1 = (1− γµ)xk − γ [ f ′j(x k)− f ′j(φkj ) + 1\nn ∑ i f ′i(φ k i )\n] .\nFor sparse implementations instead of scaling xk at each step, a separate scaling constant βk may be scaled instead, with βkxk being used in place of xk. This is a standard trick used with stochastic gradient methods.\nFor sparse problems with a quadratic regulariser the just-in-time updating can be a little intricate. In the supplementary material we provide example python code showing a correct implementation that uses each of the above tricks."

Details of these datasets can be found in [9]. We used the same code base for each method, just changing the main update rule. SVRG was tested with the recalibration pass used every n iterations, as suggested in [8]. Each method had its step size parameter chosen so as to give the fastest convergence.\nWe tested with a L2 regulariser, which all methods support, and with a L1 regulariser on a subset of the methods. The results are shown in Figure 2. We can see that Finito (perm) performs the best on a per epoch equivalent basis, but it can be the most expensive method per step. SVRG is similarly fast on a per epoch basis, but when considering the number of gradient evaluations per epoch is double that of the other methods for this problem, it is middle of the pack. SAGA can be seen to perform similar to the non-permuted Finito case, and to SDCA. Note that SAG is slower than the other methods at the beginning.

Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method.",
