{"title": "Causal Strategic Inference in Networked Microfinance Economies", "abstract": "Performing interventions is a major challenge in economic policy-making. We propose \\emph{causal strategic inference} as a framework for conducting interventions and apply it to large, networked microfinance economies. The basic solution platform consists of modeling a microfinance market as a networked economy, learning the parameters of the model from the real-world microfinance data, and designing algorithms for various computational problems in question. We adopt Nash equilibrium as the solution concept for our model. For a special case of our model, we show that an equilibrium point always exists and that the equilibrium interest rates are unique. For the general case, we give a constructive proof of the existence of an equilibrium point. Our empirical study is based on the microfinance data from Bangladesh and Bolivia, which we use to first learn our models. We show that causal strategic inference can assist policy-makers by evaluating the outcomes of various types of interventions, such as removing a loss-making bank from the market, imposing an interest rate cap, and subsidizing banks.", "id": "9fe8593a8a330607d76796b35c64c600", "authors": ["Mohammad T.

They show that such interactions have a market-clearing equilibrium. They apply this model by looking at microfinance data and fitting the data to a nearby equilibrium solution. The learned parameters are then utilized in predicting how the market would perform under perturbations.\n\nEquilibrium analysis for microfinance appears to be the main contribution of the paper (such analysis is known in other situations like paid search auctions) [edit for clarity: inference from the computed equilibrium is what I mean by analysis here]. The main problem, however, is that the paper is not in a publishable state and needs a re-write to make it readable. For instance, the entire introduction section only talks about microfinance in general. The sections abruptly ends with a justification for a few assumptions that leave the reader bewildered as to the connection with the work. The results seem interesting but the paper needs a lot of work in flow and readability.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The authors present a novel application of statistical learning and optimization, by algorithmically computing an equilibrium point, to the problem of interventions in networked microfinance economies. \n\nThe paper is very well written and presents the problem, as well the solution, very clearly. The authors present a simple algorithm for computing the market-clearing interest rates in equilibrium. The only issue is that from the paper, it is not clear whether the equilibrium has any social welfare properties, for e.g. are the interest rates reasonable?\n\nI think this paper deserves to be presented at NIPS. The community would benefit from being introduced to this type of data, that the paper presents clearly, that can result in more people looking at the problem with other approaches. This is an application paper that is very well-written and easy to understand, that introduces an important problem of interventions in networked economies. The NIPS community would benefit from being introduced to this type of data.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "SUMMARY: This paper presents a model for analyzing policy decisions, particularly ones that require some causal knowledge, in microfinance markets. The model is justified by several studies, and analyzed to show the existence of equilibrium prices. A computational framework is then presented to compute an equilibrium and learn the parameters of the model from real micofinance data. Finally, the authors leverage the framework to provide answers to several policy questions.\n\n\nCRITIQUE: By all metrics, this is a good paper. It is clear, well-motivated, well-supported by analysis and data, introduces novel techniques, and has a potential for impact. I point out a few specific problems below, and I do wonder whether this is a good fit for NIPS, but defer to more senior members for the latter.\n\n\nSUGGESTION: The assumption that MFIs are non-profits is crucial to the entire analysis, yet in my mind is a source for some of the more interesting questions. At the very least, it would be interesting to note what changes when MFIs are profit seeking, either analytically or empirically. Specifically, could the social welfare actually increase if MFIs were even slightly profit seeking, and therefore requiring fewer subsidies over time? It seems that if you expanded your model slightly you might be able to answer this question.\n\n\nSPECIFIC COMMENTS:\n\npage 2:\n. \"[13] and joint-liability contracts would mitigate the risks of adverse selection [13]\" -- odd to cite [13] twice in the same sentence\n. \"study of causality\" -- this term is not really defined, and to many people may seem extremely vague (i.e. all of science); even though you very nicely explain everything in the appendix, it might go a long way to describe the scope of \"causality\" here\n. \"Put differently, what would be a game-theoretic analog of the do operation [21, p. 23] used for surgeries in probabilistic settings?\" -- This sentence is somewhat meaningless unless you know the reference; please clarify the context\n\npage 3:\n. \"subset of the village\"[s]\n. \"interest rate at which MFI i gives loan\" -- the phrase \"gives loan\" seemed odd to me\n. \"max_{r_i} 1\" -- this is jarring without an explicit reassurance that you indeed intended max 1\n. \"each MFI i is optimizing (P_M)\" -- add \"the left-hand side of\" (one cannot optimize an inequality)\n\npage 4:\n. \"we model the village side as non-corporate agents.\" -- Where does this come up in the model?\n. Property 3.2. -- Interpret this for us in words\n. \"trivial allocations\" -- Again, remind us what x is by saying why this would be trivial\n\npage 5:\n. \"that a more restricted case\" -- this sentence has a bug\n. \"Change ri as described later.\" -- Cite a specific equation number so the reader isn't left looking for where you fill this in (it's not obvious)\n\npage 6:\n. \"Our model computes lower equilibrium interest rate\"\n Clear, well-motivated, well-supported by analysis and data, introduces novel techniques, and has a potential for impact.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
