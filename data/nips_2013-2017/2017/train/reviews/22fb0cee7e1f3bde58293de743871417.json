{"title": "DPSCREEN: Dynamic Personalized Screening", "abstract": "Screening is important for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of diseases.  A good screening  policy should be personalized to the disease, to the features of the patient and to the dynamic history of the patient (including the history of screening).  The growth of electronic health records data  has led to the development of many  models to  predict the onset and progression of different diseases. However, there has been limited work to address the personalized screening for these different diseases. In this work, we develop the first framework to construct screening policies for a large class of disease models. The disease is modeled as a finite state stochastic process with an absorbing disease state. The patient observes an  external information process (for instance, self-examinations, discovering comorbidities, etc.) which can trigger the patient to arrive at the clinician earlier than scheduled screenings. The clinician carries out the tests; based on the test results and the  external information it schedules the next arrival.  Computing the exactly optimal screening policy that balances the delay in the detection against the frequency of screenings is computationally intractable; this paper provides a computationally tractable construction of an approximately optimal policy.  As an illustration, we make use of a large breast cancer data set.  The constructed policy screens patients more or less often according to their initial risk -- it is personalized to the features of the patient -- and according to the results of previous screens \u2013 it is personalized to the  history of the patient. In comparison with existing clinical policies, the constructed policy leads to large reductions (28-68 %) in the number of screens performed while achieving the same expected delays in disease detection.", "id": "22fb0cee7e1f3bde58293de743871417", "authors": ["Kartik Ahuja", "William Zame", "Mihaela van der Schaar"], "conference": "NIPS2017", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "This paper presents DPSCREEN, a method for determining optimal screening policies for large classes of diseases. Compared to other work in the area, DPSCREEN takes into account both the patient's clinical (screening) history, in addition to patient features pertinent to the specific disease model. As a result, DPSCREEN is able to achieve personalization in the screening process, which yields efficiency gains over existing screening policies without negatively impacting the timeliness of disease detection.\n\nOverall I found this paper to be well-written and technically sound. The approach is well-motivated, considers pertinent related work, and provides a concise but thorough discussion of the mathematical basis of the algorithm, including computational complexity. DPScreen is validated on a large (45k patient) dataset from the Athena Health Network. This sufficiently demonstrates the improvements provided by personalization. The model is also validated across disease model types. The result is a paper that makes a clear technical contribution that also has the potential for practical impact as well.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The objective of the paper is to find the best policy for patient screening given the pertinent information. To provide the policy, a disease should be modeled as a finite state stochastic process. The policy is trying to minimize screening costs and delays. The authors propose an approximate solution that is computationally efficient. The experiments on simulated data related to breast cancer indicate that the proposed algorithm could reduce delays while keeping the same cost when compared to a trivial baseline\n Positives:\n+ personalized screening is an important topic of research\n+ the proposed algorithm is reasonable and well-developed\n+ the results are promising\n+ the paper is well written\n Negatives:\n- the proposed algorithm is purely an academic exercise. It assumes that the disease model of a given patient is known, which could be never assumed in practice. The main obstacle in personalized screening is not coming up with a policy when the model is known, but inferring the model from data. \n- the methodological novelty is not large\n- the experiments only compare the proposed algorithm to a baseline doing annual screening. Given the previous point about the disease model, an important question that should be studies experimentally is the robustness of the proposed method to inaccuracies in the disease model. In other words, how sensitive is the policy to uncertainties in the disease model.\n Overall, the topic is interesting and the proposed algorithm is reasonable. However, the methodological novelty is not large and the paper would need to do a better work to convince readers that this work is practically relevant.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}, {"comments": "The paper suggests a method for predicting appropriate screening time for breast cancer patients to minimize screening cost and delay cost.
