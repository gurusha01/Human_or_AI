{"title": "Variational Memory Addressing in Generative Models", "abstract": "Aiming to augment generative models with external memory, we interpret the output of a memory module with stochastic addressing as a conditional mixture distribution, where a read operation corresponds to sampling a discrete memory address and retrieving the corresponding content from memory. This perspective allows us to apply variational inference to memory addressing, which enables effective training of the memory module by using the target information to guide memory lookups. Stochastic addressing is particularly well-suited for generative models as it naturally encourages multimodality which is a prominent aspect of most high-dimensional datasets. Treating the chosen address as a latent variable also allows us to quantify the amount of information gained with a memory lookup and measure the contribution of the memory module to the generative process. To illustrate the advantages of this approach we incorporate it into a variational autoencoder and apply the resulting model to the task of generative few-shot learning. The intuition behind this architecture is that the memory module can pick a relevant template from memory and the continuous part of the model can concentrate on modeling remaining variations. We demonstrate empirically that our model is able to identify and access the relevant memory contents even with hundreds of unseen Omniglot characters in memory.", "id": "3937230de3c8041e4da6ac3246a888e8", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Bornschein", "Andriy Mnih", "Daniel Zoran", "Danilo Jimenez Rezende"], "conference": "NIPS2017", "accepted": true, "reviews": [{"comments": "The authors propose variational memory addressing.

This variational memory addressing model can combine discrete memory addressing variables with continuous latent variables, to generate samples only with few samples in the memory, which is useful for few-shot learning. The authors implement a VAE version of their model and validate it for the few-shot recognition tasks on the Omniglot dataset, on which it significantly outperforms the Generative Matching Networks, which is an existing memory-augmented network model. Further analysis shows that the proposed model accesses relevant part of the memory even with hundreds of unseen instances in the memory. \n\n\nPros:\n- Performing discrete, stochastic memory addressing for memory-augmented generative model is a novel idea which makes sense. Also, the authors have done a good job in motivating why this model is superior to soft attention approach.\n- The proposed variational addressing scheme is shown to work well in case of few-shot learning, even in case where existing soft-attention model fails to work. \n- The proposed scheme of interpreting the memory usage with KL divergence seems useful.\n\nCons\n-Not much, except that the experimental study only considers character data, although they are standard datasets. It would be better if the paper provides experimental results on other types of data, such as images, and compared against (or coupled with) recent generative models (such as GANs)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper that presents a novel, working idea. It has effectively solved the problem with existing soft-attention memory addressing model, and is shown to work well for few-shot learning. Thus I vote for accepting the paper. \n\n- Some typos:\nLine 104: unconditioneal -> unconditional\nLine 135: \"of\" is missing between context and supervised.\nLine 185: eachieving -> achieving\nTable 1 is missing a label \"number of shots\" for the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,10 and 19.", "IS_ANNOTATED": false, "IS_META_REVIEW": false}], "histories": []}
