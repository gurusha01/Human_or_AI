  Writing reviews for machine learning (ML) research papers in conferences like ICLR, NeurIPS, and ACL involves providing constructive feedback that evaluates the paper's contributions, methodology, clarity, and significance. Below is a set of instructions that can guide you through writing an effective review -

  1. Read the Paper Thoroughly: Start with an initial read to get a general understanding of the paper. Note the key ideas, the problem being addressed, and the proposed solution. Carefully go through the paper a second time, focusing on the methodology, experiments, and results. Take notes on areas that are unclear or require further explanation.

  2. Structure Your Review
    Summary: Begin with a brief summary of the paper. This should be a few sentences that encapsulate the problem, the proposed solution, and the main contributions.
