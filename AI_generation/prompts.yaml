  Writing reviews for machine learning (ML) research papers in conferences like ICLR, NeurIPS, and ACL involves providing constructive feedback that evaluates the paper's contributions, methodology, clarity, and significance. Below is a set of instructions that can guide you through writing an effective review -

  1. Read the Paper Thoroughly: Start with an initial read to get a general understanding of the paper. Note the key ideas, the problem being addressed, and the proposed solution. Carefully go through the paper a second time, focusing on the methodology, experiments, and results. Take notes on areas that are unclear or require further explanation.

  2. Structure Your Review
    Summary: Begin with a brief summary of the paper. This should be a few sentences that encapsulate the problem, the proposed solution, and the main contributions.
    Strengths: Highlight the strengths of the paper. What are the key contributions? Is the problem significant? Is the methodology sound? Are the results convincing?
    Weaknesses: Identify the weaknesses. Are there flaws in the methodology? Are the experiments lacking in rigor or scope? Is the writing unclear in places? Are there any unsupported claims or assumptions?
    Questions and Suggestions: Provide constructive feedback on how the paper could be improved. This might include suggesting additional experiments, clarifying certain sections, or addressing potential limitations.

  3. Evaluate Specific Aspects
    Novelty and Originality: Assess whether the paper presents a novel idea or method. Does it advance the state of the art in a significant way?
    Technical Soundness: Evaluate the correctness of the methodology. Are the experiments well-designed? Is the theoretical analysis solid?
    Clarity and Presentation: Consider the quality of writing and presentation. Is the paper well-structured? Are the figures and tables clear and informative? Are the equations properly defined?
    Reproducibility: Check if the authors have provided enough detail for the work to be replicated. Are the datasets and code available?
    Impact: Consider the potential impact of the work. Does it address an important problem? Could it lead to further research or practical applications?

  4. Be constructive and respectful.

Carefully go through the paper a second time, focusing on the methodology, experiments, and results. Take notes on areas that are unclear or require further explanation.

  2. Your review should have the following structure:
    Strengths: Begin with a brief summary of the paper. This should be a few sentences that encapsulate the problem, the proposed solution, and the main contributions. Highlight the strengths of the paper. What are the key contributions? Is the problem significant? Is the methodology sound? Are the results convincing?
    Weaknesses: Identify the weaknesses. Are there flaws in the methodology? Are the experiments lacking in rigor or scope? Is the writing unclear in places? Are there any unsupported claims or assumptions?
    General discussion: Provide constructive feedback on how the paper could be improved. This might include suggesting additional experiments, clarifying certain sections, or addressing potential limitations.

  3. Evaluate Specific Aspects while keeping the structure of review limited to three sections - strengths, weaknesses and general discussion:  
    Novelty and Originality: Assess whether the paper presents a novel idea or method. Does it advance the state of the art in a significant way?
    Technical Soundness: Evaluate the correctness of the methodology. Are the experiments well-designed? Is the theoretical analysis solid?
