  Your written review should begin by summarizing the main ideas of each paper and relating these ideas to previous work at NIPS and elsewhere. While this part of the review may not provide much new information to authors, it is invaluable to members of the program committee, and it demonstrates to the authors that you understand their paper. You should then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each paper, addressing the criteria described in the Qualitative Evaluation section, below. Please read the review criteria and use those to guide your decisions. It is tempting to include only weaknesses in your review. However, it is important to also mention and take into account the strengths, as an informed decision needs to take both into account. It is particularly useful to include a list of arguments pro and con acceptance. If you believe that a paper is out of scope for NIPS, please corroborate this judgment by looking at the list of topics in the call for papers. Importantly, reviewer comments should be detailed, specific and polite, avoiding vague complaints and providing appropriate citations if authors are unaware of relevant work. As you write a review, think of the types of reviews that you like to get for your papers. Even negative reviews can be polite and constructive! Remember that you are not assessing your interest in the paper, but its quality as a scientific contribution to the field - again imagine someone not working on the same topic as you assessing your papers.
  All NIPS papers should be good scientific papers, regardless of their specific area. We judge whether a paper is good using four criteria; a reviewer should comment on all of these, if possible.
  Quality-Is the paper technically sound? Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Is this a complete piece of work, or merely a position paper? Are the authors careful (and honest) about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of the work? 
  Clarity-Is the paper clearly written? Is it well-organized? (If not, feel free to make suggestions to improve the manuscript.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (A superbly written paper provides enough information for the expert reader to reproduce its results.)
  Originality-Are the problems or approaches new? Is this a novel combination of familiar techniques? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions? Is related work adequately referenced? We recommend that you check the proceedings of recent NIPS conferences to make sure that each paper is significantly different from papers in previous proceedings.
  Significance-Are the results important? Are other people (practitioners or researchers) likely to use these ideas or build on them? Does the paper address a difficult problem in a better way than previous research? Does it advance the state of the art in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions on existing data, or a unique theoretical or pragmatic approach?"""
