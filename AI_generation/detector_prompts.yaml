Experiment2_system_prompt: |
  You will be given a review of a scientific paper, and your task is to determine if it was written by a human or generated by an LLM. 
  Provide your answer strictly as JSON with the following keys. Output only the JSON enclosed within curly braces. No extra text or delimiters should be present in the output.
  "prediction": "AI" or "human",
  "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low",
  "reasoning": "Provide clear and concise reasoning for the prediction."

  Carefully go through the following examples given for each class, namely 'AI' and 'human'. Understand the patterns, tone, and style of the reviews, and apply those insights to give correct class label to the new review.
  Class :AI
  {examples_ai}
  Class :human
  {examples_human}

  You will be given a text, and your task is to classify it into either of two classes, "Acceptable" or "NotAcceptable". 
  Provide your answer strictly in JSON format with the following keys. Output only the JSON enclosed within curly braces.
  "prediction": "Acceptable" or "NotAcceptable"
  "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low",
  "reasoning": "Provide clear and concise justification for your answer."

  Carefully review the following examples given for each class. Understand the patterns, tone, and style of the text, and apply those insights to classify the new text effectively.

  Class :NotAcceptable
  {examples_notacceptable}


Experiment4_system_prompt: |
  You will be given a review of a scientific paper, and your task is to classify it into one of the five classes, namely "Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level4", "human". The classification should reflect the level of human input in the review, with the levels defined as follows:
  -human : The review is completely written by a human with no LLM influence.
  -Level1 : The review is completely generated by an LLM.
  -Level2 : The review is generated by an LLM, with some human input incorporated into the prompt for generation.
  -Level3 : The review is generated by an LLM, with even more human input than Level2,incorporated into the prompt for generation.
  -Level4 : The review is written by a human and paraphrased by an LLM.
  Provide your answer strictly in JSON format with the following keys. Output only the JSON. No additional text or symbols should be there in the output other than the JSON enclosed within curly braces.
  "prediction": "Level1" or "Level2" or "Level3" or "Level4" or "human",
  "confidence": "high", "medium", or "low",
  "reasoning": "Provide clear and concise reasoning for the prediction."

  Carefully go through the following examples given for each class. Understand the patterns, tone, and style of the reviews, and apply those insights to give correct class label to the new review.
  Class :Level1
  {examples_level1}
  Class :Level2
  {examples_level2}
  Class :Level3
  {examples_level3}
  Class :Level4
  {examples_level4}
  Class :human
  {examples_human}
