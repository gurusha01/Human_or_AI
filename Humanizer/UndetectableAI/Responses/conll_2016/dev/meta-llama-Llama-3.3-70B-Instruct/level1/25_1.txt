This research suggests a method that combines semisupervised learning with minimum cuts to link word meanings to their corresponding time frames It highlights the key contributions of this study as follows; 
A new method using graphs is presented by the authors. They suggest a classification technique that combines WordNet definitions and relationships, with data to enhance WordNet entries. 
Enhanced accuracy in classification has been achieved with the new method surpasses previous semi supervised non graph classification methods and sets a new standard in distinguishing between temporal and atemporal contexts as well, as past and future categorization. 
A trustworthy time related dictionary resource is developed by the authors through crowd contributions showcasing the success of their method, in generating a notch temporal vocabulary reference. 
The papers notable attributes include; 
The authors effectively utilize WordNet relationships to build a graph that represents the connections, between word meanings and enhances the accuracy of classification tasks. 
A method that combines limited labeled data, with data to enhance classification performance is the semi supervised approach being suggested here. 
The authors thoroughly assess their approach by conducting intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations to showcase its effectiveness. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The authors recognize that the task is complex and challenging when it comes to assessing the aspect of synsets using their definitions. 
The use of graphs in this approach might make it harder to grasp compared to machine learning models when it comes to understanding the reasoning, behind decisions made. 
Relying heavily on WordNet might hinder its usefulness in languages or fields, beyond its scope. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to deal with the intricacies of the task and enhance the clarity of the method based on graphs? 
Could the writers share details, about how they put together the gold standard dataset and managed the crowdsourcing process? 
How do the writers imagine using their language tool, in practical situations like automatically analyzing time focused clinical stories?
