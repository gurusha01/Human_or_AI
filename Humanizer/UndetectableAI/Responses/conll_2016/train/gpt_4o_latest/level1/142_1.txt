Reviewing the submission.
Key. Contributions; 
This study discusses the issue of integrating uncertainty assessments into the evaluation of Machine Translation Quality Estimation (QE) a task typically assessed using single point metrics. The researchers suggest employing Gaussian Processes (GPs) for modeling in QE because of their capacity to offer reliable uncertainty estimates. They introduce enhancements, like Matèrn kernels and Warped Gaussian Processes to improve the handling of noisy information and response variables that are not normally distributed. The study assesses these models by utilizing Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) a measure that considers uncertainty and showcases their effectiveness in scenarios with varying risks like editing after the fact and summarizing tasks at a glance The research also emphasizes the challenges of conventional point estimate metrics, in capturing variations in uncertainty modeling. 
The key findings of the paper, from my perspective are; 
Introducing Uncertainty Metrics for Quality Estimation (QE); Incorporating NLPD in assessing QE models marks a substantial advancement in gauging the precision of uncertainty assessments—an aspect often disregarded by conventional metrics such, as MAe and Pearsons r value. 
The use of Distorted Gaussian Methods in Quality Evaluation (QE); Expanding GPs with warping functions to represent Gaussian result variables is an innovative and influential addition to the field of QE data sets, with erratic and asymmetrical distributions. 
Exploring Asymmetric Risk Scenarios in Real Life Translation Workflows involves using distributions with loss functions like AL and linex to show how uncertainty aware models are beneficial, in practical situations. 
Areas of expertise; 
The paper fills a void in Quality Estimation studies by concentrating on uncertainty modeling—a crucial aspect for practical uses such as post editting and summarization tasks, in real world scenarios. 
Comprehensive assessment; By utilizing datasets and employing cross validation alongside a range of metrics such as NLPD (Normalized Log Probability Density) MAe (Mean Absolute Error) and Pearsons r coefficient, for correlation analysis ensures a rigorous evaluation of the suggested models.The conducted experiments effectively showcase the benefits of employing methodologies. 
The real world significance lies in investigating risk situations which shed light on how uncertainty aware QE models can be useful, in various industry contexts. 
The paper establishes a theoretical basis for the suggested approaches by delving into Matèrn kernels and Warped GPs in detail while also exploring Bayes risk estimators, for imbalanced losses. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper briefly touches upon the issue of scalability by mentioning that Gaussian Processes (GPs) face challenges when dealing with datasets but fails to delve into how the suggested approaches would fare in situations involving larger Quality Estimation (QE) datasets or more complex feature spaces. 
Generalizability Concerns Outside of QE Scope; While the authors suggest that their techniques could be used for text regression tasks as well the paper falls short of providing solid examples or tests to back up this assertion. 
Uncertain Findings Regarding Linex Loss in Negative Situations; The outcomes related to Linex loss in circumstances vary and cast doubts about the adequacy of the suggested models for such situations prompting a need, for more research. 
Questions, for Writers; 
How will you tackle the scalability issues of GPs when dealing with QE datasets or feature sets with higher dimensions? 
Could you share some examples or case studies to show how your techniques can be used in types of text analysis tasks besides Quality Estimation (QE)?
Could you explain further why the outcomes of the loss led to uncertain conclusions, in negative situations and suggest potential ways to address this in upcoming research? 
In summary 
This article adds insights to the QE field by presenting probabilistic models and metrics that consider uncertainty aspects into account closely. Though there are constraints, in scalability and universality the study is backed by motivation, methodological robustness and practical significance. I suggest approving it with an advice for the authors to tackle the scalability issues and elaborate more upon the universality of their approaches.
