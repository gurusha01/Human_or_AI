"Overview of the Study"
This study focuses on tackling the issue of part of speech tagging in languages, with resources by utilizing both rough cross language annotations and a small set of accurately annotated data as reference points. The writers introduce a neural network design that relies on a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) enhanced with a noise layer to specifically address and rectify inaccuracies in the projected annotations. The system is trained using both quality and predicted data and tested on eight artificial low resource languages along, with two genuine low resource languages. Malagasy and Kinyarawanda.The findings indicate that the suggested method delivers top tier results by surpassing techniques. 
Key Contributions
The research paper proposes the incorporation of a noise layer into the Bi LSTM model to effectively manage and rectify the errors found in projected part of speech tags across different languages.This unique addition directly. Resolves the inherent noise present, in cross language projection methods and enhances the usefulness of imperfect annotations. 
Using both noisy data in training enhances performance in situations with limited resources as shown by the suggested framework that merges a small set of well labeled data, with less precise projected data. 
The model undergoes testing in various languages. Both artificial and real world low resource languages. And shows top notch performance across all datasets, with notable enhancements seen in Malagasy and Kinyarwandan datasets. 
Areas of excellence
The papers innovative noise layer stands out for its focus, on incorporating noise into projected annotations to overcome a key limitation of cross language projection methods effectively and practically. 
The new model shows results by consistently performing better than standard methods and cutting edge techniques in various datasets without significant resources available for both simulated and real world languages alike. Especially standing out in languages such, as Malagasy and Kinyar1 
The approach is versatile. Can be used for various tasks that involve inaccurate annotations like distant supervision or data, from crowd sourcing efforts.This wide range of applications strengthens the significance of the study. 
2nd Point Analysis; The article presents test findings that encompass removal studies and illustrations of the acquired noise transformation matrices to clarify the models performance and efficiency. 
Areas, for improvement
The study only touches on the behavior of the noise layer with a visuals of the noise matrices it learns without delving deep into how this layer adjusts to various languages and noise patterns which could enhance the paper with a more thorough investigation of these dynamics. 
The paper doesn't cover the efficiency or adaptability of the suggested method when dealing with datasets or more intricate tasks, which might raise concerns, for real world application. 
The method hinges on the presence of datasets to function effectively but might face challenges with accessing such data for languages, with limited resources available freely.Similarly the research paper does not delve into exploring potential sources of imperfect annotations like monolingual datasets or languages that are closely related. 
Queries, for Writers 
How does the models performance shift with the rise in the amount of annotated data in the gold standard set? Is the addition of a noise layer advantageous, in settings where resources are abundant? 
Can the suggested noise layer be modified to deal with forms of noisy annotations, like those collected from crowd sourcing or distant supervision sources? 
What resources does the model need for training, with datasets or languages having intricate structures?
