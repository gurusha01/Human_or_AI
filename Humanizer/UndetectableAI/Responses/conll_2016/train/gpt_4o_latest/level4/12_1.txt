Beforehand I had evaluated this document when it was presented as a draft, for the ACL 2016 conference paper submission.The experimental arrangement had an issue then that has since been rectified and fixed. 
In the past when we talked about it before I said I'd be willing to consider the draft, for another *ACL event long as the issue was fixed. Now that the problem has been taken care of I don't see any reason to hold back acceptance.
Another reviewer mentioned that the structure of the paper might seem a bit unrealistic when it comes to commonly spoken languages with limited resources; especially in terms of the balancing act between locating and compensating annotators. I think it's important to touch upon this issue, in the writeup to prevent overstating the feasibility of the approach. 
In addition to that point about annotation projection for languages with limited resources like the ones discussed by Johannsen et al in 2016 and Agic et al in 2015 at the ACL conference. It would be beneficial to incorporate a discussion of these works, within the related literature section to enhance the overall comprehensiveness of the paper. 
In summary I believe that this submission is quite valuable and I suggest accepting it. 
It would be helpful to know if the data used in the research will be shared with the public in the future.I'm optimistic that the data will be accessible for research purposes, at this point.
