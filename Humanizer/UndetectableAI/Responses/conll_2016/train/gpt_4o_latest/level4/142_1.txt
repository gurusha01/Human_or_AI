The study looks into how models such as Gaussian Processes (GP) are used to predict the post editing time and rates, for evaluating the quality of machine translated content.  
The document is nicely structured with an introduction that clearly explains the issues of using QE point estimates in real life situations. I found the part about asymmetric risk scenarios and the need, for varied estimators quite insightful.  
For those who are already acquainted with Gaussian Processes concepts and principles but may not fully grasp them yet. The paper spends time revisiting these ideas to ensure a wider audience can understand them better and appreciate their significance. I find that this thorough examination of the GP methodology along with discussions, about kernel selections and the application of warping is clear and straightforward to follow. In summary the thought provoking research inquiries presented in the article are both compelling and clearly articulated. 
I do have some questions and suggestions, about the Results and Discussion sections. Specifically regarding the assessment of uncertainty.  
Why did they opt for edit rates over estimating (Human Translation Error Rate)? The Human Translation Error Rate is commonly employed in Quality Estimation studies; it would have been beneficial for the paper to explain the rationale, behind this decision.   
I find the first paragraph of Section 3 difficult to understand What pattern do you see in fr en and en de datasets that is not present, in en es dataset The paper states that NLL and NLPD decrease significantly with warped GPs for all three datasets but this requires further explanation.   
Even though the paper mentions that its main focus is not on pushing the boundaries of technology (since only the usual 17 baseline features are used) adding an additional point estimate model from studies to the result tables could have been helpful in establishing a more precise benchmark, for evaluating the models overall performance.   
It can be tricky to understand the NLL and NLPD values mentioned in the text above because they may not give an indication of how accurate the predictions are compared to using MAE as a standard measure for that purpose in tables. The main point of the paper is to emphasize that relying on MAE is not ideal for evaluation purposes. To enhance clarity and insight for readers and researchers alike it would be helpful to supplement this argument with real life examples that demonstrate what exactly constitutes a decrease, in NLL/NLPD values and why it holds importance. 
Section 4 stands out as an easy to understand explanation of the findings. 
Overall I believe the paper makes a contribution by emphasizing the drawbacks of point estimates, in QE and underscoring the importance of incorporating uncertainty in this complex field of study. Although the paper doesn't push the boundaries or bring forth groundbreaking modeling advancements (considering GPs have been utilized before) its research queries are well defined and skillfully tackled. 
There are some concerns.  
Section 4 should use "over " and "underestimates."  
The caption, for Figure 1 should say the lines are blue and green of blue and red as mentioned initially.   
It would be beneficial to mention the particular toolkit utilized for GP modeling in the version of the paper.
