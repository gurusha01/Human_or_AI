This paper presents an approach that I believe is unique in framing different tasks involving scoring sentence pairs (such as Answer Set Scoring and Paraphrasing tasks among others) as specific examples of a larger task. Understanding the semantic connections, between two sentences.The authors also investigate the potential of creating network models that can be applied widely across these various tasks.I personally find this idea to be creative and convincing suggesting that it deserves to be shared at CoNNL and discussed further. 
However the paper seems unfinished, in its state. It should be considered for publication only if certain revisions are implemented in the draft;   
Please ensure that the initial table of results is filled out before proceeding.   
The analysis of the results provided is lacking in detail. Does not adequately address the numerous individual findings presented in the report An immediate need exists for a more thorough examination and explanation of the discoveries.   
The abstract mentions a dataset that poses greater challenges; however the paper seems to fall short of fulfilling this statement.This discrepancy needs to be resolved.   
The outcomes differ greatly from one task to another task in the study findings report by the authors. They ought to explore and talk about the reasons behind why the models perform in certain tasks but poorly in others tasks. Even when cut solutions are not discovered it would be beneficial to know their viewpoint regarding whether these differences arise from restrictions in modeling or inherent distinctions, between the tasks. Does conceptualizing all of these tasks as an entity actually stand true ?  
The paper needs to have sample cases, from datasets to demonstrate both common sentence pairs and ones that are difficult to classify.   
Is the Ubu RNN transfer learning model suggested for tasks because of the tasks general nature or the dataset size it requires to perform well on such tasks? The authors should investigate how this query could be tackled. 
Although the document is not yet complete in its development stage the paper introduces a method that could initiate significant conversations.I would be delighted to witness its publication following polishing.However I recognize that other evaluators may have differing viewpoints, on this matter. 
There are a small language problems.   
The words "weigh" and "weighed" are frequently used of "weight" and "weighted," which would be the correct terms to use in those contexts.   
There are instances of misspellings in the word "sentence " such, as "sentene."  
"The meaning of 'interpunction' is not clear. Needs to be explained or changed."  
I meant to type "word overlap ". Ended up with "world overlap."
