The paper lacks specifics regarding the methods employed to produce the findings due to 'nondisclosure restrictions.' Without insights into the learning algorithm or training data used in the process and other resources applied in the methodology; it fails to provide any value to individuals looking to enhance their sentiment analysis skills through research sharingâ€”an essential goal of scholarly work exchange hence rendering this submission unsuitable for a research paper presentation, at this conference. It could be better suited for a presentation at another event of a demo session here; however even for a demo paper more in depth methodological information would be necessary, than what is currently available.
