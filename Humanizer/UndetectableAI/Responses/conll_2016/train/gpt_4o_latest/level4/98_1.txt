This study assesses how delexicalized transfer parsers and an unsupervised parser enhanced with external probabilities perform based on findings, from the UD treebanks. 
The article is interesting; however there are some areas that could use enhancement. 
McDonald and colleagues in 2011 achieved an accuracy of 61​.​ 7% while our transfer parser on Universal Dependencies (UD) for the same languages attained a higher accuracy rate of 70​.​ 1%. It's worth noting that McDonald et al​.​ were unable to make use of the UD treebanks due, to their unavailability during that period; this detail should be clearly stated. 
In the number nine of your writing you mentioned that you utilized the Malt parser with its default featureset and suggested that some fine tuning in this delexicalized task might lead to slightly better outcomes." If you're sticking with MaltParsers default settings as is currently the case, for optimization reasons why not consider implementing MaltOptimizer " Enhancing the model through optimization could offer promising outcomes." Likewise " delving into optimizations for MSTParser could prove beneficial." Moreover " have you thought about exploring parsers known for their superior performance?"The latest parsers have already been tested on dependencies using a leave one out approach (see references below). For example the writers suggest that the unsupervised parser "shows performance, for languages belonging to less resourced language groups (non Indo European) " but its important to confirm the validity of this statement when utilizing newer (and cross language) parsers. 
The selection of probabilities in Tables 3 and 4, in Table 3 seems a bit random to me.I believe additional information or a series of experiments would be necessary to support their application and prove their accuracy. 
There are a number of papers that the authors should take into account.

   Hey Ammar! Just wanted to share with you that I found some research by Mulcaire and Ballesteros. Also came across some insights, from Dyer and Smith. Lets discuss it sometime!  
Here are some small details to consider;   
"I don't think we need Table 1 and Table 2 here. Table 1s details could just be included in a footnote directing readers to the UD website instead.If we keep Table 2 since it relates to probabilities. Having both seems repetitive and unnecessary."
