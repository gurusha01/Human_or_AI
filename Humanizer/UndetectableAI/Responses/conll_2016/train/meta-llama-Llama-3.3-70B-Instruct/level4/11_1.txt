The writers present an approach, to the coreference task tailored for Wikipedia content by focusing on linking mentions to the entity described in an articles coreference chain. The writers then introduce starting points and a fundamental classifier that surpasses them in performance and show that incorporating their classifier into the Stanford coreference system produces significant enhancements compared to cutting edge systems, on Wikipedia. 
This article presents a new approach to coreference that could breathe new life into research in the field and connect coreference with entity linking studies more effectively.The concept of concept resolution is particularly intriguing from the standpoint of information extraction as it revolves around extracting entity specific information. Often the focal point of a document.The conventional coreference task has its drawbacks, like incorporating irrelevant mentions. A pitfall that this new task manages to sidestep effectively. 
From a methodological perspective,"main concept"s serve as a point of reference for coreference discussions; however researchers can enhance these methods further beyond the basic levels—especially when it comes to non pronoun references.Coreferencing on Wikipedia also presents avenues for utilizing knowledge in engaging manners as showcased by the authors.This field is poised to provide a platform, for exploring concepts that could enhance coreference practices overall;yet it might pose challenges when assessed in a broader context. 
This paper differs from studies that concentrated on particular facets of coreference by addressing the broader coreference issue within the context of Wikipedia. A domain important, to the ACL community.The methods proposed are practical though not groundbreaking and the features employed appear reasonable.However it remains uncertain if the authors investigated combinations of these features that might yield additional enhancements. 
Some small suggestions for enhancement include rearranging the paper to introduce the dataset on and providing clearer references for the Stanford coreference system while also explaining the terms used like the "candidate list" of mentions better. Additionally⁠—there seems to be a difference between Sections 4 point 3 and 6 point 2 regarding the extraction of WCR mentions that needs addressing. On the whole⁠—the paper introduces a new task and showcases significant enhancements over existing systems⁠—thus making a valuable contribution, to the field.
