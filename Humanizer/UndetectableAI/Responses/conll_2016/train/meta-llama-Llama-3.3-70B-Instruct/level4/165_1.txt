This research introduces a method for recognizing similarities between languages based on the Minimum Description Length (MD)== principle== The writer creates connections between words with similar meanings in various Slavic languages by creating codes that identify common substrings in two or more languages An MD== objective== is designed to manage both the complexity of the model and the description of the data, within the modelThe system is taught using the Expectation Maximization technique and tested on a set of 13 Slavic languages; the outcomes are showcased through distance metrics and a family tree analysis, alongside instances of identified similarities. 
The reasoning behind this method seems solid and opting for MD Land appears to be a decision in addressing this issue The explanation for using EM is also well laid out However I found some of the explanations a bit unclear The authors mention the similarity between the MD Land objective and Bayesian inference which prompts thoughts of comparing it to phylogenetic inference techniques like the ones employed in MrBayes A practical comparison, with these techniques could offer some valuable perspectives 
In terms of research mentioned in this papers related work section lacks a thorough comparison with current techniques for identifying borrowed words and related words, as well as other ways of studying historical language through computational means. Some studies by Alexandre Bouchard Cote,Tandy Warnow,Luay Nakhleh and Andrew Kitchen might be relevant to consider. While some of these methods may not directly apply to our dataset referencing List and Moran (2013) would serve as a solid starting point. Moreover it could be valuable to explore tools used in biological phylogeny inference, like paup and MrBayes. 
The method and strategy used in the paper come with certain limitations to consider. The process of alignment is computationally intensive which limits the comparison to just five languages maximum. Given that the paper deals with languages and evolutionary relationships represented by trees it would be intriguing to learn about the authors approach to tackling this challenge. Additionally the choice of using neighbor joining for constructing trees has well known disadvantages like the need, for manual root specification. Exploring advanced techniques could be beneficial. It's not clear whether EM runs until it reaches convergence or if it uses a stopping criterion. 
The information utilized in the research paper comprises two datasets; one includes cognates while the other does not necessarily involve them (referred to as Swadesh lists). It would be advantageous to investigate the impact of this blend on the outcomes obtained from the analysis process. Additionally the data is presented in its form which could potentially obscure numerous connections between items of both datasets especially in cases where languages use different writing systems. This circumstance might result in learned patterns indicating alterations in scripts than genuine linguistic similarities. To address this issue employing transcriptions could help mitigate this limitation and offer a clearer understanding of the underlying linguistic correspondences present, in the datasets. 
Some parts of the paper are still not clear to me – for instance the meaning of "optimal single word choice for symbols in all guidelines”, on line 286 and how the combining happens during the stage of maximizing. 
There's a problem, with using "focus in on " instead of just saying "focus on " as shown in line 440.
