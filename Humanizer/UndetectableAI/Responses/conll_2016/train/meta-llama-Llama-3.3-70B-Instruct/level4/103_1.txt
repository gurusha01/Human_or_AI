This study introduces a method for evaluating the quality of topics using word embeddings to measure similarity either directly or through matrix factorization and has shown impressive results, on standard datasets. 
The new method suggested is a step forward in the field of topic evaluation research but there are worries about varying performance levels of different methods on different datasets.The method shows top notch results on all three datasets; however no single technique consistently outshines the best practices and the SVD based methods struggle notably with the genomics dataset.This inconsistency is a worry, for those wanting to use the method across different datasets. SVDs average results on the genomics dataset could be due to the significant number of out of vocabulary (OOVs). It might be feasible determining the effective approach by align with GloVe vocabulary; however this aspect remains uninvestigated, in the paper. 
There are matters that require consideration; 
The suggested technique shares resemblances, with strategies found in the chaining research field that the authors ought to explore and integrate into upcoming iterations of the manuscript. 
The approach is said to be parameter free; however; it actually depends on word embedding techniques that include an amount of hidden parameters. Something that should be recognized and noted. 
The paper doesn't clearly explain how the method deals with out of vocabulary terms like the ones, in the genomics dataset that are not included in the trained GloVe embeddings dataset Are these terms just disregarded. How does this affect the performance of the method? 
Furthermore there are minor issues that require attention ; 
In Section 2; The explanation of word embeddings suggests that the length of the vectors doesn't matter much when comparing their similarity using cosine measurement method. However this assumption faces an issue as word vectors, from word 3 are not naturally unit length and have been adjusted post training to be normalized. 
The graphs displayed in Figure 1 are too tiny to read and make it difficult to understand the findings effectively.
