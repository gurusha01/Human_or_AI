This study delves into the use of delexicalized transfer parsers and an unsupervised parser that incorporates probabilities in the UD treebanks with interesting outcomes being observed. 
In order to improve the paper more some recommendations are put forward.  
Compared to the findings of McDonald et al.s study in 2011 where they achieved an accuracy of 61·7% it is worth mentioning that our current research has attained a higher accuracy rate of 70·1% analyzing the same languages with the UD treebanks technology in place this time around. It's essential to highlight that McDonald et al.s study did not have access to the UD treebanks as they were not available, during their research period. 
The Malt parsers default feature set discussed in 9 brings up some concerns that need addressing. It's advisable to tune the parser with MaltOptimizer to potentially enhance outcomes. Likewise optimizing the MSTParser could also prove beneficial. Moreover consider using parsers known for their superior performance, with universal dependencies especially in leave one out scenarios. One example is reconsidering the assertion that the unsupervised parser performs well for languages from language families, with resources using these updated parsers. 
It seems like the addition of chances was a random choice basedon Tables 3 and 5, in Table 3 specifically requiring more thorough clarifications or a set of tests to confirm how useful these chances are. 
There are some studies worth looking into such as "Cross Lingual Dependency Parsing using Universal Dependencies and Predicted Parts of Speech Labels " written by J Tiedemann and "Training Bilingual Parsers using a Single Model for Two Languages and Harmonized Treebanks " authored by D Vilares along, with MA Alonso and C Gómez Rodríguez that showcase outcomes based on MaltParser. Moreover articles on parsers, such, as the paper "Crosslingual dependency parsing based on distributed representations " authored by Jiang Guom et al. And the article "Many languages, one parser " written by W Ammarm et al. might offer useful perspectives. 
It might be an idea to take out Table 1 and just mention the information, in a footnote linking to the UD website instead of keeping it there directly on the page; however we should think about keeping Table 2 because of the probabilities it shows.
