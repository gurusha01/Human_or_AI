This research delves into examining how part of speech (POS) label details are reflected in the data found in word vector models. The researchers use a customized edition of the British National Corpus (BNC) which is annotated with Universal Dependencies (UD) where words are substituted with their lemmas. They proceed to generate word embeddings based on this collection and utilize the vectors to train a logistic classifier that predicts word POS. The assessments are carried out using cross validation with the dataset and also extended to other datasets, for comparison purposes. 
The paper is nicely organized and easy to understand; however an important point to note is the lack of originality in its approach to natural language processing (NLP). The experiments outlined are simple. Do not present any fresh concepts or techniques in NLP or machine learning (ML). Nonetheless the findings are intriguing as they offer evidence supporting the concept of POS making it a valuable contribution, for a quantitative or empirical linguistics setting. 
Additionally it would be advantageous, for the paper
