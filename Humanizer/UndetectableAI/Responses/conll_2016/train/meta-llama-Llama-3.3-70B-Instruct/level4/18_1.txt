This paper introduces a graph parser that is meant to work with the structures found in the UCCA corpora that follow a semantic and cognitive annotation system.The authors discuss the aspects of an annotation system based on semantics which includes being graph oriented with non terminal nodes and accommodating disjoint elements.These principles are versatile. Can be used beyond semantic frameworks such as, in syntax or other layers of representation. The authors start by framing their study in the realm of semantic analysis and conduct three rounds of parsing trials. Phrase based parsing approaches and dependency parsing methods along with their suggested transition based graph parser, for direct UCCA graph parsing. 
Although I'm fascinated by this works content and ideas presented therein; I do have a reservations about the methods and empirical evidence provided by the authors in support of their claims. They assert themselves as pioneers in introducing a parser designed for a driven framework like theirs; however; their transition sets fail to cater specifically to the distinctive attributes of such graphs. Numerous existing graph parsers proposed by Almeda and Martins (2014 and 2015) well as Ribeyre et al.(2014 to 2015) could potentially be modified for application, with this dataset. Why weren't the parsers considered as reference points for comparison? Moreover... 
The absence of references to models and parsers presents a notable drawback in this studys scope.If the UCCA schemes abstract nature were taken into account it could have been advantageous to employ metrics used in relevant shared tasks for a more thorough assessment.Although these issues are worth considering I am of the opinion that this paper merits discussion at a conference such, as ConLL as it adds value to the investigation of semantic parsing. 
Some extra. Recommendations.
The paper should introduce the concept of "grounded semantic'' on, for better clarity and understanding. 
The writers might have considered examining the use of constituent trees with node labels and propagator traces that were trained and parsed using the Berkeley parser as a starting point. 
Switching to surface dependency tree conversion might not be required; a comprehensive approach, like the one recommended by Schluter et al. in 2014 could serve as an alternative solution instead. 
The writers need to offer details or examples to explain the idea that "In UCCA graphs there may be hidden elements that do not exist in the text."
The schemes capacity to represent quantifier scope information is uncertain. Its comparability, to other syntax focused schemes is restricted. 
The authors three principles appear to be put together and could benefit from a more clearly defined introduction. 
An error analysis would offer insights, into the difficulties involved in interpreting the UCCA scheme shedding light on the outcomes further.  
Mentions of established graph parsers like the one at corentinribeyre.fr and the TurboParser on GitHub can be incorporated to draw comparisons, with models and parsers.
