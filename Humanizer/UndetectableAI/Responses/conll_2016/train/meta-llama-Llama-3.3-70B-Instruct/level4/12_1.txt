Another reviewer mentioned that the structure of the paper might seem a bit contrived when considering low resource languages and the substantial expenses involved in recruiting versus compensating annotators.With that said I concur that it's crucial to address this constraint, in the paper to prevent any exaggeration of the methods effectiveness. 
The writers might also want to think about including discussions on research regarding annotation projection for languages with very limited resources, by Johannsen et al (2016 ACL) and Agic et al (2015 ACL) to offer a broader view of related studies. 
I believe this paper provides insights and I support its acceptance decision; nonetheless it would be helpful to confirm the availability of the research data to the public for transparency purposes in accordance, with standard research practices.
