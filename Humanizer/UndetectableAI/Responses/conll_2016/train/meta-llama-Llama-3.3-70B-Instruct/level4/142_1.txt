This research explores how probabilistic models, like Gaussian processes can be used to forecast the time or rates of post editing for assessing the quality of machine translation results and efficiently The paper is nicely structured with an introduction that points out the challenges of using point estimates in real life quality assessment situations The part discussing different risk scenarios and their estimators stands out as particularly interesting and insightful
The writers offer an overview of Gaussian processes that serves as a helpful introduction for those new to the subject despite its lengthiness.This article provides explanations of using Gaussian processes along, with how kernels are selected and warping is applied.The research inquiries raised in the paper are thought provoking and well crafted. 
Several queries and recommendations come up concerning the findings and discussions sections. This is especially true when considering the evaluation of uncertainties.
Selectively using edit rates instead of predicted HTER as the target variable requires explanation since HTER is a frequently forecasted metric, in quality assessment studies. 
The initial section of Section 3 is a bit confusing because it talks about a pattern noted in the fr en and en de datasets that doesn't apply to en es data; even though the NLL and NLPD measurements show decreases, with distorted GPs across all three sets. 
The paper clearly mentions that its goal is not to push the boundaries of knowledge but suggests that adding a specific model based on previous studies using standard 17 baseline features in the result tables could offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of the models overall. 
It can be tough to understand the meanings behind NLL and NLPD values. Its easy to want to use MAF values to assess prediction variances as a substitute strategy despite the papers disagreement with this method; having detailed examples for qualitative analysis would better showcase the importance of decreases, in NLL and NLPD. 
Section 4 is clearly. Presents the findings in a way that is easy to understand. 
The paper is praiseworthy for bringing attention to the challenges associated with point estimates in quality assessmentâ€”a task that requires additional data like confidence intervals to be effective.\ While the submission doesn't push the boundaries or introduce groundbreaking advancements in modeling techniques it does effectively present its research questions and objectives, with clarity and precision. 
There are some concerns to address; 
In Section 4,"over and underestimates" should be changed to "overand underestimates."
The description, under Figure 1 mistakenly mentions the lines as blue and red when they are actually blue and green. 
It would be helpful to mention the toolkit used for Gaussian process modeling in the papers version.
