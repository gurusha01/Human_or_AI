This paper presents an innovative method that I believe is unique in its approach by categorizing different tasks involving scoring sentence pairs like Answer Set Scoring and Paraphrasing under a more comprehensive task that focuses on comprehending the semantic connections, between sentences.The authors also delve into the idea of creating network models that can be applied across various tasks within this category.I am intrigued by this proposal. Think it would be valuable to present at CoNLL for further dialogue and exploration. 
However I do have an issue with the paper as it seems like there are some missing parts in it that need to be addressed before it can be ready, for publication. 
Ensure that the first draft of the results table is filled out completely to offer a summary. 
There are many individual outcomes that the written explanation is lacking and needs a deeper analysis and interpretation. 
The abstract talks, about introducing a dataset that is more difficult but doesn't provide it in the paper—an issue that requires clarification. 
The outcomes show differences among various tasks which warrants a deeper exploration into the reasons for the models performing well or poorly across these tasks would be helpful even if a definitive explanation is not discovered understanding the authors standpoint on whether this disparity arises from modeling challenges or variations, in tasks would be insightful questioning the effectiveness of categorizing these tasks as a cohesive entity is crucial. 
Adding sample cases from datasets with both typical and challenging sentence pairs, for classification would improve the paper. 
The Ubu RNN transfer learning model is suggested for tackling tasks; however it's uncertain if this preference stems from the datas characteristics or the datasets size impact on performance clarity, on resolving this query would be beneficial. 
Despite the draft of the papers content structure and wording not being perfectly polished yet the methodology it presents could spark engaging conversations; seeing it published in a more polished format would make me happy I understand that other reviewers might not feel the same way. 
A quick heads up. There are a couple of language related concerns.
Please provide the input text for me to paraphrase. I'll be happy to assist you further with a human like rewrite!
Several occurrences of "sentene" need to be fixed to read as "sentence”.
The term "interpunction" is not clearly. Needs clarification. 
One occurrence where "world overlap" needs to be fixed to "word overlap".
