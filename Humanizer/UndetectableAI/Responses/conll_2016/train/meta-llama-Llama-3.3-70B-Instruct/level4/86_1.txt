This paper doesn't provide information about how it was done; it mentions 'non disclosure restrictions as the cause for this lack of transparency. This means that the methods used in the learning algorithm and training data are not clear and readers are unable to gain any insights to help them with their own sentiment analysis techniques. Sharing research is important for spreading knowledge and progress. The absence of key details in this submission hinders this goal. Therefore it falls short of being a research paper, for this conference. Perhaps a demo session could be a fit; however even in that scenario a more thorough explanation of the techniques used would be required to justify its inclusion.
