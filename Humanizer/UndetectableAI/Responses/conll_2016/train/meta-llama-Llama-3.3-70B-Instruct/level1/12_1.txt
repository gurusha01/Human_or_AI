This study introduces a method, for sequence labeling that is designed to rectify mistakes stemming from cross language projection by incorporating a designated noise layer into the process.  
Proposing a learning model that can learn from both annotated data and projected data simultaneously.  
The incorporation of a noise conversion layer that depicts the relationship, between distorted labels.  
The method was tested on actual low resource languages and achieved outstanding outcomes. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects;  
The method used by the authors to simulate noise, in language projection is innovative and successful.  
A bidirectional LSTM combined with a noise layer enables the learning of both accurate and distorted labels.  
The assessment of both actual low resource languages illustrates the effectiveness of this method and its resilience, in diverse settings.  
The findings indicate that the suggested approach surpasses cutting edge algorithms in performance. 
The shortcomings of this document are;  
It might not always be accurate to assume that the background noise, in the projected data can be represented by a linear transformation.  
Harnessing a quantity of labeled data might prove inadequate, for effectively training a strong model.  
The assessment of two actual low resource languages might not accurately reflect the situation, for all low resource languages.  
The evaluation of cutting edge algorithms might not cover all aspects thoroughly. 
Authors here are some inquiries, for you;  
How did the researchers figure out the size, for the annotated dataset? 
Could the authors offer information, about the noise transformation layer. Like how it gets started and adjusted throughout training sessions?  
How is the suggested method dealing with situations where the predicted labelsre very unreliable or conflicting?  
Can the writers offer insights, into the noise transformation matrices they studied to understand the specific errors they are addressing?
