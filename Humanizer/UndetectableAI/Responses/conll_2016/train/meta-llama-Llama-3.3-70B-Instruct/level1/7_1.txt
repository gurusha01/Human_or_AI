Overview of the Research Article
The paper presents an approach called Positive Only Projection (PoF) which is used to create semantic spaces and word embeddings by leveraging random projections with a positive expected value in the projection matrix (E(R)>0). Unlike methods utilizing random projections without restrictions on expected values or weights, like Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) PoF introduces positive weighting techniques to enhance the resulting vectors. The researchers assess how well PoS built models perform on the MEN similarity test and show that they deliver outcomes when compared to cutting edge neural embedding methods but with much lower computational demands. 
Key Contributions 
The authors introduce the Poisson of Probability (PoS) technique as an approach, to creating semantic spaces by utilizing random projections that have a positive expected outcome value. 
The authors show that applying PPMl weighting to PoPop built models can improve their effectiveness, in tasks assessing similarity. 
The authors suggest utilizing Kendalls τB correlation coefficient to calculate similarities among vectors, in PoPS built models as it proves to be an efficient approach compared to other similarity metrics. 
Advantages
PoS designed models deliver results on the MEN relatedness test that are on par with cutting edge neural embedding methods, in terms of performance competitiveness. 
Efficient calculation is achieved through the Poisson Probability (Po P) technique and the utilization of Kendalls τ b correlation coefficient to compute similarities This makes it ideal, for large scale use cases. 
Flexibility is an aspect of the PoS technique as it can be paired with different weighting methods, like PPM to improve its effectiveness. 
Areas, for improvement
The authors admit that there is a need, for a comprehensive mathematical explanation of the PoPS technique to enhance its comprehension and acceptance. 
Randomized method used in the PoI technique is subject to fluctuations in its effectiveness due, to its starting point. 
The authors mentioned that the effectiveness of the PoG approach is influenced by selecting the hyperparameters like the size of the projected index vectors and the quantity of non zero elements.
