Overview of the Research Document 
The research suggests a method for sentiment analysis by adding cognitive features from eye movement patterns to the usual features used in this task. The authors believe that sentiment analysis is difficult because of the complexities at linguistic levels; lexical meaning and syntax to interpret meaning at pragmatic levels. They bring in aspects, from eye tracking data that record how readers gaze while labeling text with sentiments. The writers test out their method on two sets of data. Show a notable enhancement in identifying sentiment polarity in text—especially when dealing with intricate structures, like irony and sarcasm. 

The authors suggest a collection of characteristics based on eye movement behaviors that reflect how readers process sentiment laden text. 
Enhanced sentiment analysis has shown progress by blending conventional and cognitive attributes resulting in a considerable enhancement in gauged sentiment positivity identification with a rise of 4.% and 9.% in F measure, on two separate datasets. 
The method works well with text containing elements such as irony and sarcasm and shows a 6​ ​percent enhancement, on a separate dataset. 
Areas of expertise
A fresh idea is presented in the paper offering a take, on sentiment analysis through the inclusion of cognitive aspects obtained from eye tracking patterns. 
There has been an enhancement in sentiment analysis with this method—particularly, in identifying sentiment polarity in intricate text samples. 
The researchers thoroughly assess their method on two sets of data. Conduct a detailed examination of the outcomes which includes conducting statistical significance exams and analyzing the importance of features. 
Areas, for improvement
Eye tracking data is not always easy to come by for all uses of the approach due, to its availability. 
Analyzing gaze features can be intricate as extracting aspects from eye movements may demand considerable computational resources. 
The method might not be easily applied to languages or fields and could need substantial adjustments and refinements. 
Dear Authors, Queries, to Writers 
How do you intend to tackle the challenge of having an amount of eye tracking data accessible and what methods do you suggest for gathering and labeling extensive eye tracking datasets on a large scale? 
Could you share information about the computing resources needed to analyze cognitive aspects from eye movements and your strategies, for improving the process of extracting these features effectively? 
How do you intend to test if your method works well in languages and fields and what adjustments or refinements do you suggest for using it with new sets of data?
