In this study the authors compare transfer and minimally supervised parsing methods across 32 diverse languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank dataset.The researchers introduce a supervised parser that utilizes external prior probabilities to assist in parsing; these probabilities can be manually set or derived from other treebanks.The key findings of this research include; 
The authors conduct an evaluation of delexicalized transfer and minimally supervised parsing methods, in their study to showcase the pros and cons of each approach. 
Introducing a supervised parser that offers a new method, for parsing utilizing a blend of unsupervised dependency parsing and external prior probabilities to assist with low resourced languages. 
The authors assess their method across 32 languages and present a detailed examination of the outcomes. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The authors thoroughly assess their method. Compare its performance with advanced delexicalized transfer parsers, in their study. 
A new method has been introduced with a supervised parser in the field which offers a fresh perspective on analyzing languages, with limited resources. 
The extensive assessment conducted across 32 languages offers an examination of the methods effectiveness while also pointing out its advantages and drawbacks. 
The flaws, in this paper include; 
The evaluation given by the authors is comprehensive. Lacks a deeper analysis of the results regarding linguistic factors that impact the parsers performance. 
The authors should have compared their method with unsupervised parsing approaches to offer a more thorough analysis of the field without any direct comparisons, with other unsupervised parsing methods being made. 
The authors could have delved deeper into the impact of their findings by discussing how their approach could be applied to languages, with resources. 
Questions, for the writers; 
Could you give me information, about how different linguistic factors influence how well parsers work and how these factors differ from one language to another? 
How do you intend to expand your method to include languages, with limited resources and what obstacles and constraints might arise from this approach? 
Could you offer a thorough analysis of how your method differs from other unsupervised parsing methods and delve into the advantages and limitations of each approach?"
