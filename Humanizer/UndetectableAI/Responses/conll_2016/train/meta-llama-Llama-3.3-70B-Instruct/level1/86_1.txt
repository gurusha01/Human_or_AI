In this paper we share the findings from an assessment of the latest sentiment analysis tools that focus specifically on app reviews and tweets written in Italian and English languages. 
The creators have designed two tools called AppCheck and TweetCheck to analyze sentiments, in app reviews and tweets using techniques in learning. 
The authors tested their tools on sets of app reviews and tweets which comprised 11 thousand app reviews in both Italian and English languages along, with 3899 Italian tweets and 1000 English tweets. 
The authors have tested their tools against 18 leading research tools such as the iFeel platform and SentiStrength to demonstrate that their tools generally perform better, than these competitors. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The researchers carried out experiments, on various datasets to compare their tools with cutting edge research tools in a comprehensive manner. 
Applying robustly in both App Check and Tweet Check has demonstrated results where they surpass many other research tools in aspects such, as macro F ₁ score accuracy and F ₁ score across positive negative and neutral categories. 
The authors employed learning methods to build their predictive models, for achieving advanced sentiment analysis performance. 
The papers drawbacks include; 
Transparency issues arise in the creation of AppCheck and TweetCheck as the creators fail to offer insights into their tools development process such as the features utilized and the algorithms incorporated along, with training data specifics. 
The authors do not thoroughly examine the results in detail by discussing why their tools are more effective, than research tools and the constraints of their methodology. 
The authors solely evaluate their tools against research tools. Do not include a comparison, with commercial tools that are commonly used in practice. 
Questions, for writers; 
Could you give me information regarding the creation of AppCheck and TweetCheck apps such as the features utilized and the algorithms employed in addition, to the training data used? 
How do you intend to overcome the challenges posed by the constraints of your method. Such as the absence of clarity, in crafting your tools and the restricted evaluation of outcomes? 
Could you compare your tools to those, in the market and talk about the pros and cons of using your tools in real life scenarios?
