In this article suggests using approaches like Gaussian Processes (GP) for evaluating Machine Translation Quality (QE) to offer accurate uncertainty assessments.The writers claim that conventional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAA) and Pearsons r correlation coefficient doesn't reflect the unpredictability of forecasts; a vital aspect, in translation scenarios. 
The primary contributions of this study are; 
Using Gaussian processes for quality estimation enables the assessment of uncertainty, in predictions. 
The suggestion of using the Negative Log Predictive Density (NLPD) metric to assess how well probabilistic QE models perform considers the posterior predictive distribution. 
In situations where risksre unequal and outcomes of overestimating versus underestimating vary significantly asymmetric loss functions, like asymmetric linear (AL) loss and linear exponential (linex) loss are used to account for these differences. 
The positive aspects of this article are; 
The writers offer a rationale for incorporating probabilistic approaches, in Quality Engineering (QE) pointing out the shortcomings of conventional single point evaluation criteria. 
The suggestion to use NLPD as an assessment measure, for QE models is well founded and offers a deeper insight into the models effectiveness. 
Using asymmetric loss functions, in Quality Estimation is an approach that offers a better reflection of the risks associated with translation situations. 
The studies are well planned. Offer a comprehensive assessment of the suggested approaches which also involves comparing them with conventional single value measurements. 
The shortcomings of this document are; 
The writers believe that the confidence levels given by the GP models are accurate; however this may not always be true, in reality. 
Using one dataset, for each language pair may not accurately capture all the different translation situations that could arise. 
The writers did not thoroughly examine the expenses associated with the suggested approachesâ€”a potential issue, for extensive translation endeavors. 
The paper would be more insightful with an exploration of how the results could impact the advancement of QE systems and their practical use, in real life translation settings. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the challenge of ensuring that uncertainty estimates, in GP models are accurately calibrated and what techniques can be employed to assess the calibration of these uncertainty estimates? 
Could the writers offer information regarding the computational expenses of the suggested approaches and how they could enhance them for extensive translation tasks? 
What are the practical implications of utilizing asymmetric loss functions, in real life translation scenarios as proposed by the authors and what advantages and obstacles might arise when implementing these loss functions in practice?
