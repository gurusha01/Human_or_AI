This study suggests a model that can recognize named entities across languages without being dependent on any specific language framework by utilizing a cross language wikifier to clarify each n word sequence effectively. The model is compatible with all languages in Wikipedia and only needs access to a Wikipedia data dump for operation. The researchers test their approach on languages, under both single language and cross language conditions demonstrating noteworthy enhancements compared to established benchmarks.
The primary achievements of this study include; 
The writers present a method for creating language neutral characteristics, for Named Entity Recognition (NER) by utilizing a cross language wikifier that connects words and phrases to the English Wikipedia. 
The new model for identifying named entities in languages can be used across all Wikipedia languages and has shown better performance compared to similar methods on the usual CoNNL datasets and languages, with limited resources. 
The authors show that their language neutral features can boost NER systems as well and deliver better outcomes across all 9 languages examined. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
Utilizing Wikipedia efficiently is key in this context as it enables the writers to source information across languages and create a model that transcends language barriers, for widespread application. 
The new model performs well across various languages and excels in identifying named entities even in languages, with limited resources. 
The models adaptability and ability to scale are highlighted as strengths in the study â€“ it can be trained on source languages to enhance performance, in cross language Named Entity Recognition (NER).
The papers shortcomings include; 
The effectiveness of the wikification features is influenced by the breadth of content available on Wikipedia in the language being targeted; this could pose a challenge for languages, with limited resources. 
The writers rely on Wikipedia categories and FreeBase types as features while overlooking other valuable information available, on Wikipedia. 
The authors did not discuss how their model compares to methods of multilingual Named Entity Recognition like parallel projection or automatically generating training data, from Wikipedia for a more thorough evaluation of their models effectiveness. 
Asking authors some questions; 
How do the writers intend to overcome the challenge of relying on the size of Wikipedia for languages, with resources? 
Could the writers try out methods for multilingual named entity recognition like parallel mapping or automatically creating training data, from Wikipedia and include them in their model? 
How are the writers intending to test their model on a range of languages that have fewer articles, on Wikipedia?
