This research paper presents a deterministic dependency parsing method and evaluates how well it works with various languages.  
The algorithm is built upon a set of guidelines that establish relationships using POS tags as references.It starts by organizing words through a biased PageRank system applied to a graph that links words based on allowed connections.As it moves along the process each word is linked to the closest word that preserves a tree like structure and follows both the main rules and a directional limitation. 
The paper overall is interesting and well crafted. However it seems like there are only differences compared to Sogaards work from 2012 titled "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing, without Training." Here are some questions and ideas I have; 
Head Rules (Table 2); It would be helpful to examine how these rules apply to the dataset in detail. For example in section 3 of the document it is noted that although the rules may not always generate a graph of connections, between data points. However there is no mention of how this happens or the usual size of the clusters that result from this lack of coherence. 
It was unexpected to see that the head direction was established based on the test data of the training or development data in this case scenario That choice may lead to a quick convergence (, within 10â€“15 sentences) though it is definitely an unconventional decision made. 
When words have the PageRank score in search engine algorithms how are decisions made to break ties, between them ? Does the process of breaking ties have an impact or are instances of ties so rare that they do not significantly influence performance outcomes ?
The limitations used (rules for the beginning of a sentence or phrase formation and the distance between elements, in a sentence or phrase formation process) naturally set boundaries on how the system can perform overall. It would be interesting to add oracle outcomes for every limitation because it could show how much each restriction restricts the possible score that can be attained. This could offer direction for upcoming efforts to enhance the system. 
I have some comments to share.
In Section 4 we acquire the rank. 
Tables 5 and 7 have a column order with Table 7 being arranged in a clearer and more intuitive way. 
Section 6 subsection 6 "determine the impact of each one separately."
