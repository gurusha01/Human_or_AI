This paper introduces UDP—a dependency parser, for Universal Dependencies (UD)—that utilizes personalized PageRank and a small collection of head dependent rules to enhance its functionality and accuracy. 
The authors have put forward a parser that's linguistically robust and does not need any training data instead relying on the explicit part of speech (POS).
The authors make smart use of PageRank to evaluate key content words in order to enhance the parsers efficiency when pinpoint the main action of a sentence. 
The parser shows resilience to changes in domain, across different languages and sometimes surpasses a multi source delexicalized parser (MSB).
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
UDP shows performance across most UD languages except, for two and even surpasses MSD in the case of Hindi. 
The parser is more resilient to changes, in the quality of part of speech tags compared to MSD; its performance decreases by an average of 1%.
Domain robustness is demonstrated by UDP as it exhibits consistency across various domains when compared to MSD and displays a reduced level of performance variance across different languages. 
The paper has its flaws, such, as; 
The parser struggles with linguistic elements like multiword expressions and proper names which could impact its effectiveness, in specific languages or subject areas. 
Relying heavily on the constraints of Universal Dependencies (UD) the parser might not be suitable, for all languages and linguistic frameworks. 
There is still room for enhancement, in edge labeling as the authors solely focus on attachment; integrating partial edge labeling could enhance the systems performance even more. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand the parser to address language aspects, like multiword expressions and coordination? 
Could the writers offer details, on how well the parser performs with languages that have scarce resources or unconventional linguistic structures? 
How do the writers imagine incorporating UDP into NLP tasks, like semantic role labeling or machine translation?
