Here is a fresh method outlined in this paper for analyzing sentence structures called dependency parsing in languages to see how well it works out in practice. As the program moves up the ranking list​​​​​ each word is linked to the word that follows a tree like structure​​​ follows the rules of hierarchy​​​ and meets a directional restriction. 
The article is interesting and well organized; however it shares similarities with research work such as Sogaard (2012) "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing without Training" albeit, with some minor differences highlighted in a few areas that require additional explanation and thought; 
The guidelines mentioned in Table 1 would be improved by delving into their analysis within the corpus setting.In Section 3. 8 There's an acknowledgment that these guidelines may not always lead to a connected graph.However it doesn't provide information, about how often this happens and the usual size of the resulting components. 
Choosing to determine head orientation using test information of training or development information is quite interesting. Even though the decision quickly comes together (within 10 to 15 sentences) which makes it a minor issue it's an approach. 
The method, for handling situations where words have the same PageRank scores isn't well defined in the explanation given and it would be beneficial to know if this has a notable impact performance or if such occurrences are infrequent enough to not matter much in practice. 
The different limitations such as rules governing heads and the direction of information flow set boundaries on how the system can perform at its best capacity.Thoroughly examining the results for each constraint would offer insights into how they influence the highest attainable score.This could be especially helpful, in shaping enhancements to the system by pinpointing where enhancements could be made. 
A few things I noticed; 
In Section 4 Point 4. we could improve the clarity of the statement "we achieve [the desired level]."
The order of the columns in Table 5 and Table 7 is not the same. I find the layout, in Table 7 easier to understand. 
In Section 6 it might be helpful to rephrase the statement "determine the [contribution]" for clarity.
