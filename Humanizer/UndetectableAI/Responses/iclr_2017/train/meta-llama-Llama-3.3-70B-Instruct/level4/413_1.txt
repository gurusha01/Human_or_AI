This document suggests a method to improve the performance of networks that process related sequences by selectively calculating differences between successive inputs." The paper is well organized. The approach is cleverly designed with a clear link to spiking networks." While the idea is interesting " its benefits are mostly theoretical ". Executing it on current hardware may pose challenges." Additionally " I speculate that integrating a penalty for slow changes, into the training of deep networks could lead to significantly larger computational savings " possibly outweighing the advantages of the proposed technique."
