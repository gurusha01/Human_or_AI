This document introduces a memory element created for extensive and continuous learning situations as well, as single instance learning settings." The new module showcases its adaptability by incorporating it into various neural network structures and delivering improved results overall. 
Though the use of k neighbors for memory recall is not a new idea and has been discussed in earlier studies like Rae et al.s work from 2016 and Chandar et al.s research from the same year as well as being applied to one shot learning in [R1] this paper adds value by presenting thorough experimental findings that demonstrate its practicality and efficiency, across various architectural settings. 
The writers have sufficiently answered all the queries I raised during my evaluation and I am pleased, with their replies. 
I'd like to ask if the authors are open to sharing the source code to help with reproducibility of their work? Especially, for the experiments done with Omniglot and the synthetic tasks.
