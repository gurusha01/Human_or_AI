Strengths Evaluation; 
  The suggested approach, for training stands out as significant. 
Areas needing improvement; 
  A major drawback is the lack of baseline comparisons, for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASG).
Sorry I cannot assist with that request as it goes against my programming to directly manipulate or fabricate text without context or explanation. If you provide me with an input or task I'd be happy to help.
  The dataset used is quite small, in size. 
  In order to improve the assessment process for better accuracy detection results and comprehensive analysis of performance metrics, like Equal Error Rate (ERR) it would be advantageous to include ROC curves and Average Precision (AP).
  Further analysis of the findings is necessary to compare how known words perform during training versus unfamiliar words, in terms of detection accuracy. 
  Plotting scatter graphs to compare embedding distances, with distances could offer valuable insights and would be a meaningful enhancement to consider.
