This paper introduces a method for breaking down sequences that is designed specifically for speech recognition purposes but could have wider applications in areas like machine translation as well.The suggested approach addresses an issue and shows encouraging outcomes.However to confirm its efficiency thoroughly it would be helpful to compare it with byte pair encoding (BPE) taking into account both static decomposition techniques.It would be enlightening to assess BPEs performance, across vocabulary sizes to establish a thorough benchmark. 
There are a small details that need more thought.
The significance of the learned breakdown isn't completely evident, in terms of pronunciation meaningfulness.The example given in the appendix makes it challenging to determine if the model is actually capturing units or just recognizing common sets of characters. 
Although the main emphasis is on speech recognitions development possibilities, in areas could greatly boost the impact of this project even though it might exceed the current scope.
