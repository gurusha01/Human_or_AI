The revised paper now reflects all the points that concerned me initially and has led me to raise my rating and recommend its acceptance. 
I'm sorry. Without the original input text to paraphrase I am unable to provide a finished rewrite. If you provide me with the text you want me to paraphrase I'll be happy to assist you with creating a like version.
This paper combines the progress, in variational autoencoders and autoregressive density modeling with the PixelVAEV model it introduces shows that it can achieve the same level of performance in negative log likelihood (NL L ) as a PixelCNN by using a PixelVAEV with a noticeably less complex PixelCNN decoder. 
Harnessing a VAE for grasping patterns and employing a PixelCNN decoder to depict specific details is a solid approach that could address the problem of vague visual outputs often linked to VAEs effectively. The experiments involving image creation stand out as especially significant. 
Here are a few ideas and issues I'd like to discuss regarding the manuscript; 
It could be helpful to conduct a test showing how using a PixelCNN as the decoder in a VAE can enhance the separation of factors in the hidden code representation better than using a standard VAE model. For example; train both PixelVAI and VAI models on MNIST with a 2 hidden code; then visualize the hidden code, for test images and assign colors to each code based on the digit represented to see if the PixelVAI provides clearer separation of digits in its representation. Adding a comparison of the supervised classification performance of VAE and PixelVAEin would improve the overall quality of the manuscript as well. 
A related idea is discussed in another article submitted to ICLR titled "Variational Loss Autoencoder." It would be intriguing and beneficial to include a discussion and comparison of these works, in the manuscript. 
The responses to the questions did shed some light on the architectural specifics; however I suggest that the authors should incorporate precise details of the architecture for all experiments, in the paper and/or share the code openly. The current explanation is somewhat unclear. Makes replicating the experiments quite difficult. 
In my inquiry question earlier on there was a suggestion to showcase two sets of MNIST samples in the appendix. One produced by PixelCNN and the other by PixelVAQ having the matching PixelCNN depth. To demonstrate how effectively PixelVAQs hidden code captures the overall structure. 
By attending to these issues it would result in a rating, from my end.
