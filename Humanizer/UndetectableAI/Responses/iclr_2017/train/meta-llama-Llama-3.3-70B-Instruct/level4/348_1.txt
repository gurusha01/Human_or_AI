This document lays out a basis, for using transformation groups with convolutional neural networks (CNN) supported by real world examples showing a more effective use of network parameters.  
The idea of steerability is quite intriguing. Seems like a significant concept that deserves further exploration and development since it has its origins, in the influential work of Simoncelli and others from the early 1990s.Their unique approach based on group theory provides a fresh viewpoint.However upon inspection the central concept appears to be rather simple ;the feature representation of a modified image should match the transformed feature representation of the original image. When we limit ourselves to sets, like 0째 rotations and multiples of 90째 or 180째 and 270째 rotations; bringing in complex group theory frameworks may seem unnecessary and the advantages it brings are not quite clear. The real challenge comes when dealing with transformations instead of discrete ones; if the theory could help us navigate this territory better it would be incredibly beneficial. 
Moreover the experimental process lacks transparency, which hinders the ability to replicate how the authors utilized capsules or transformation groups. A thorough explanation of the experiments would be needed in order to thoroughly comprehend and replicate the findings provided.
