This study introduces a combination of memory networks and reinforcement learning to create a fresh and original model.It's worth noting that while the experimental results are clear cut the suggested method displays potential.Yet it raises some queries, about the models strengths and weaknesses; 
How would adjusting the model to handle sentences with variables impact its performance? 
What methods would the model use if the response is not, in the predetermined list of words? 
Further investigation into the curriculum learning element would be advantageous since it significantly contributes to the reinforcement learning models training process; gaining understanding, about how it is applied and its impact could provide valuable insights. 
When it comes to training the model it would be good to explain how you choose the data samples, in each round. Do you pick them randomly or do you go from simple to examples gradually?
