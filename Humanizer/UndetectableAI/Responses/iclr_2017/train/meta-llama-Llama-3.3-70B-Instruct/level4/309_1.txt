The manuscript outlines a method for integrating auxiliary tasks into a deep reinforcement learning (RL) system like A2BCs, within Labyrinth and Atari settings to enhance performance and speed up learning processes towards better outcomes. This document basically demonstrates the application of this instinctive concept. 
The document is well organized. Can be easily understood by those knowledgeable, about deep reinforcement learning (RL) allowing readers to grasp the authorsâ€™ points and discoveries effectively. 
Could the authors elaborate on the resources needed to train the UNREAL agent for better understanding the results? 
The design of the UNREAL agent is quite intricate. Do you think the authors might share their models source code for others to use in their research studies and experiments? 
I'm ready to assist you with your request. Lets get started!
After a response.
The evaluation stays the same.
