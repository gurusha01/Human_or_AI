The writers describe a method for stabilizing recurrent neural networks that is similar to dropout but distinct in that the units are adjusted to their previous time step values, in each element with a certain likelihood instead of being set to zero. 
The paper is nicely written overall. Provides a clear explanation of the methodology that tackles the concerns brought up in the pre review stage. The overview of research is thorough and probably contains the most recent information, on RNN regularization. 
In the experiment section focuses on comparing the approach with the latest technology across various NLP benchmarks and a simulated issue that all contain sequences of distinct values. Moreover an experiment shows that the sequential Jacobian for long term connections is notably greater than, in the dropout scenario. 
The research paper seems hopeful. Raises a few issues of concern.  
During the assessment questions discussed earlier on in this study phase adding the outcomes of trials that encompass a comprehensive exploration of hyperparameters like a standard procedure for selecting models. Considering the abundance of resources at hand it is puzzling why this path was not pursued. Furthermore as indicated in Table 2 it is important to emphasize that validation error may not accurately forecast test error within the dataset, under consideration thus highlighting the risk of overfitting during model selection. Additionally zoneout doesn't seem to lead to enhancements, in other tasks. 
The study of zoneout in mathematics has not been extensively explored yet.The analysis of how the transitions from unit K at time step T to unit Kâ€™, at time step T R would provide valuable insights.It is worth investigating whether zoneout can be interpreted variably as suggested by Yarin Gals research work. Incorporating zoneout into a ResNet framework and combining it with dropout in the components shows a promising relationship; however there is a lack of in depth exploration on why zoneout proves to be effective despite having relevant references, in the existing literature. 
The datasets that were utilized consist of symbolic data; it may have been advantageous to investigate a wider variety of data types including continuous data derived from dynamic systems to better understand the applicability of zoneout, in such contexts. 
With the abundance of strategies emerging for enhancing RNN training nowadays it's crucial to differentiate zoneout from other approaches out there. Though zoneout sounds promising and easy to put into practice the paper lacks depth in its testing (points 1 and 3) and theoretical nuances (point 2). As a result the papers impact is somewhat reduced, resulting in a slight advancement well crafted content, average experimental assessment and limited theoretical clarity.
