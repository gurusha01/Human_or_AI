The manuscript introduces a method for generating images by integrating foreground and background components to form a unified picture—a practical strategy in the presence of a prominent foreground subject. However real life images commonly feature compositions, with various layers that depart from a simple foreground background contrast. It remains uncertain how the authors’ approach would address elaborate situations. 
Overall this study offers a consideration of an important issue, from an original point of view.. However extensive effort is needed to refine the suggested technique into a widely usable approach.
