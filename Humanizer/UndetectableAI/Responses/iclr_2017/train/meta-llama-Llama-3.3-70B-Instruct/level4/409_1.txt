This document introduces MusicNet. A dataset designed to tackle the persistent problem of limited data in machine learning research related to music.The datasets detailed annotations and careful verification process make it a valuable asset for the field due, to its size and genre constraints.The rigorous validation conducted on the dataset highlights the effort put into its development. 
The authors effectively showcase the datasets ability to capture low level features like sinusoidal variations through basic experiments within a comprehensive framework from start to finish. Though some may debate that the datasets main value lies in itself than in the experimental approaches or outcomes presented by the researchers. It's crucial to acknowledge the pivotal role top notch datasets play in propelling research forward and setting benchmarks, for future work. 
Considering the lack of curated datasets at present is quite significant and is expected to bring about substantial advantages in the future ahead. While its true that the experimental methods and findings may not be groundbreaking in nature per se; however the dataset itself is anticipated to rank among all accessible resources. The importance of this contribution should not be overlooked as having access to datasets plays a pivotal role, in propelling advancements in this field forward; creating such resources requires a substantial effort that research teams do not often undertake.
