Sorry for the delay in sending over my review and thanks, for addressing my questions, authors. 
This research introduces an upgraded iteration of the PixelCNN model with various enhancements like integrating dropout and skip connections and implementing changes such as adopting a different likelihood model and conducting multiscale analysis.The outcomes showcase top notch likelihood performance, on the CIFAR 10 dataset. 
In essence the main achievement of this research is its improvement of models like PixelCNN that have the benefit of being able to calculate their likelihood in a straightforward manner. One notable distinction, among these models is the method employed to simulate the likelihood of a pixel based on its surroundings ;
One research direction is depicted in the studies by Theis et al., done in 2012 and 2015 They depict the distribution as a continuous density across real numbers However this method has its limitations due to not considering the discrete nature of observed pixel intensities and assigning probability mass, beyond the valid range of pixel intensities. 
Van den Oord and his team suggest representing the probability as a random discrete distribution, across 256 potential pixel intensity levels instead of using continuous likelihood models to overcome their constraints; however this method could be less efficient and more resource intensive. 
The writers suggest an approach by keeping the discrete aspect of the conditional likelihood intact but limiting the discrete distribution to those, with cumulative distribution functions that can be represented as linear combinations of sigmoids.That idea seems practical and innovative; however it doesn't strike me as revolutionary or important. 
The authors made a change by using downsampling and multiscale modeling instead of dilated convolutions in their model to save computational time without compromising its ability to work at different scales effectively.They also added connections to prevent any loss of information during downsampling.However I don't consider this change particularly groundbreaking since the concept of analyzing images at scales with autoregressive generative models has already been explored in previous studies, like Theis et al.(2012).
In my opinion this submission doesn't bring in fresh ideas and seems to focus more on detailing a particular application of an already known concept rather than introducing original research work.
