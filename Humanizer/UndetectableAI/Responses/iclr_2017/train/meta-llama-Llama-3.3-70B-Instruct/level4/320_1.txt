This paper introduces a method, for learning visual servoing based on Q learning techniques. Key highlights of this approach include; 
A model of dynamics that predicts the features of the frame using information, from the current frame and action.  
A method involving a Q function to adjust the weights of feature channels in a servoing setup.  
An efficient and effective approach, for minimizing the Bellman error in order to enhance the learning of the Q function. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
An in depth investigation into the relationship between action and frame depiction to anticipate frame characteristics; the argument supports a locally interconnected bilinear model that strikes a balance, between computational effectiveness and expressive capability. 
The implementation of a weighted strategy to consider the significance of items across platforms has proven to be more successful, than treating errors uniformly across all channels based on experimental evidence. 
A robust optimization strategy, for the Bellman error is proposed by taking advantage of the observation that adjusting Q function parameters does not influence the selection of the policy significantly.This allows for a sophisticated Fitted Q Iteration (FQi) approach to be employed effectively. 
Nevertheless a few constraints are acknowledged.
Section 4 noticeably lacks experimental comparisons, among the three dynamics models; fully connected, convolutional and locally connected. 
Comparative analysis of the suggested Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm and an iterative strategy that addresses the component, in Equation 5 could offer valuable perspectives on their respective advantages and drawbacks. 
The study findings indicate that the lack of established benchmarks in this field has led to disappointing results because of their small size and dependenceon simplistic simulations.The alterations made to the VGG structure discussed in the assessment need to be tested experimentally to determine how they compare in performance, with the original design. 
The paper makes technical contributions and outlines the problems effectively; however it could enhance its experimental support by incorporating the mentioned suggestions to better showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method.
