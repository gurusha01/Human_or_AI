This paper introduces a method, for ternary weight quantization that provides a different approach.  
One of the highlights of the paper are its key strengths.
It shows results, than current options and highlights the promise of this innovative method. 
Learning quantization parameters of depending on preset algorithms resonates with the latest machine learning principles and introduces a fresh and forward looking approach. 
Nonetheless, 
The papers contribution is somewhat modest as it builds on existing research without any breakthroughs. 
The paper is specifically designed for an audience who are already familiar with ternary quantization research topics.The narrow focus leads to a brief but not detailed explanation of the main algorithm, for a wider audience.This limitation reduces its accessibility and effectiveness. 
The research lacks a motivation to support its significance and relevance to real world issues despite its potential applications in various areas such, as mobile technology enhancements. 
This paper essentially presents a step forward in a specific area of study without a clear practical reason for delving into this topic further; therefore its relevance to a wide and varied audience like the one, at ICLR is uncertain.. Additionally the lack of shared code could impede the ability to replicate and advance the suggested approach.
