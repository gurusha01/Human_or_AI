This article introduces a method for tackling the issues related to making deductions, on Hidden Semi Markov Models (HSMM) by using a bi directional Recurrent Neural Network (bi RNN) integrated within it to estimate the posterior distribution accurately and effectively which seems like a practical and clever approach. 
Nevertheless there may be a need for improvement, in two crucial areas.
A thorough explanation of why bi RNN was chosen over other modeling methods like structured mean field with a sequential model for variational distribution formulation would be helpful, in improving the papers clarity and credibility. 
The real world datasets used in the study are quite small with than 100 sequences each. To strengthen the papers conclusions and increase its significance it would be beneficial to include datasets, in the analysis.
