This paper presents a theory about why there is an area of focused vision in the eye of primates, by proposing that adjusting the position and size of receptive fields in an artificial eye that moves in quick jumps can reduce errors in identifying images with subimages of various sizes and locations.  
In order to make their argument stronger the writers could consider using lifelike image data and drawing a clearer connection to the quantity, size of receptive fields and eccentricities of retinal cells in animals, like the macaque. However doing so would mean finding a loss function that's biologically sound to back up their assertion, which poses quite a major hurdle. 
Furthermore the writers could strengthen their point by addressing the durations involved since the concentration of the central vision area probably relies on the quantity of permitted eye movements and the dimensions of targeted partial images potentially affecting the overall accuracy of classification. 
The high error rate of 24% in classifying dataset 2 is worrisome as it indicates that the model may not be operating optimally as expected.The main point of the paper implies that the model could potentially improve in its classification abilities through training methods or models.If other approaches prove to be more effective it raises questions, about why the human visual system does not utilize mechanisms under comparable evolutionary circumstances. 
The contrast between the model equipped with zoom features and the translation model produces surprising outcomes; the former excels over the latter in dataset 1 and matches it in dataset 2 despite the zoom enabled model seemingly being more appropriate for varying target image sizes in dataset 2. Moreover the notable error rate on dataset 2 raises questions, about whether either or both modelsre performing at their best potential potentially casting doubt on the main assertion of the paper. 
When looking at this model in relation to attention models like spatial transformer networks or DRAW might not be directly related to the main focus of the paper; it could help tackle worries about less, than ideal training or model setup and offer a deeper insight into the findings.
