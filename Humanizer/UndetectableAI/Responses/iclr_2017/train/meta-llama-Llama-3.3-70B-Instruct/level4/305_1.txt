This paper introduces a method, for image compression utilizing deep neural networks that I have come across so far The writing is top notch and seamlessly incorporates rate distortion theory into the frameworks objective function A solid baseline is set by comparing it to JPEG2000 which surpasses earlier papers that focused solely on JPEG I expect this paper to make a notable impact
To make the paper better suggests adding findings from common test images like Lena and Barbara as well as comparing them to established methods using conventional techniques for a thorough analysis of how neural network approaches measure up against older strategies in the field of research.Criteria, for placing these two method categories in context remains unclear after reviewing the draft.
