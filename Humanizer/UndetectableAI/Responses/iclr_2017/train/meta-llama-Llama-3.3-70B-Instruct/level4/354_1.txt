This research introduces a method to effectively create a group of deep neural networks that outperform a single network trained for the same amount of time. The approach involves using a learning rate that quickly brings the model to a nearby minimum and saves its progress at that stage. Afterwardly raising the learning rate allows the model to break free from the minimum and head, towards another point of interest. Throughout one training session by gathering these snapshots the authors were able to achieve impressive results that are on par with standard methods and still maintain some advantages of traditional ensembles but, at a much lower expense. 
The report is nicely organized with to understand visuals and tables that provide helpful insights from various models and datasets used in the studys findings are impressive across a wide spectrum of topics discussed in Section 5 of the document stands out as exceptionally well done adding accessible code for replication adds significant value, to the work. 
To improve the research further it would be helpful to have a conversation, about how accurate and consistent each snapshot is and to compare it more thoroughly with conventional ensemble methods. 
Initial Evaluation; 
This project is really interesting; the experiments are well thought out. Clearly explained. It's a valuable addition. 
Just a quick observation; 
In Figure 5s graph display exhibits the axis spanning from. 0 To +2 values; this stands out as peculiar since lambda typically lies within the range from 0, to 9.
