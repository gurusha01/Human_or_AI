This research combines recurrent neural networks and adversarial neural networks to tackle domain adaptation in time series data by comparing them with various other algorithms using two healthcare datasets, from MIMIC III in domain adaptation situations. 
The new idea, in this study is somewhat restricted because it mainly expands recurrent neural networks using adversarial training to acquire domain independent representations. Even though the experiment outcomes show that the suggested approach outperforms methods it's not clear what gives it this edge. The main contrast between the suggested approach and R DANN is centered on the utilization of RNN as opposed to the conventional RNN method; however the analysis lacks in depth explanation on how this distinction leads to notable differences in performance outcomes and considerable fluctuations, in observed temporal relationships as showcased in Figure 4. 
I appreciate your feedback. Let me carefully review and address each point you've raised. Your insights are invaluable. Will definitely help us improve our work moving forward. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us.
The explanation for Figure 1 needs details for claritys sake. It's important to verify if subplot 1(b)s t SNE projection represents the learned representations by DANN or R DANN as indicated in section 4. The consistency, in the VRADA plot is unexpected. Understanding the two main hidden factors depicted in Figure 1(c ) would be helpful. 
Table 3 shows a difference in results between the two basic methods when evaluated on the complete target data set (which includes the validation set) compared to just the test set alone. On the hand VRADA demonstrates very similar performance, in both scenarios. It would be helpful to understand why this difference exists. 
A thorough explanation of Figures 4 and 5 is needed to better understand the data presented in them; particularly explaining the meaning of the horizontal axis in Figure 4 and both the horizontal and vertical axes in Figure 5 would be beneficial for clarity purposes Additionally a deeper look into why the plots on the right side of Figure 5 appear more consistent compared to those on the left could be valuable, for analysis.
