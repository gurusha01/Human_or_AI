Thank you for allowing me to examine this document that delves into the topic of interaction, between two individuals. 
The article has positive aspects to consider.
The main emphasis is on a topic within the field. The exploration of how machines communicate; a topic gaining significance with the rise of reinforcement learning applications, in recent times. This study raises a fundamental query. Do machines tackle problems in a way that parallels problem solving methods? 
The straightforward nature of the task makes it easier to analyze after learning. 
Agents who are informed tend to use a variety of symbols when transmitting messages compared to agents who are less knowledgeable but rely on just two symbols, for communication. 
Nonetheless there are a constraints to take into account. 
When comparing two images from categories in a task like this one we essentially turn it into a simple image sorting challenge. The symbols used serve as labels for the images and the second agent learns to assign them. This method transforms into a transfer learning task, which might see effective and faster training through methods other, than reinforcement learning.
