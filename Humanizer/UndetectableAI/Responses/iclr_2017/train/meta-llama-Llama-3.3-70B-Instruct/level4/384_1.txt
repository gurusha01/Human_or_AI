This study explores the task of pinpoint the response to a query in a provided text where the solution is constantly intertwined within the input text content. To tackle this issue the writers suggest a strategy that combines two established techniques ; Match LSTM for linking question and text portrayals and Pointer Net for anticipating the responses position, in the text. 
The positive aspects of this document are; 
The suggested method is a fit, for the job and shows effective outcomes; however other recent studies have accomplished superior results as noted by the writers. 
The assessment of the SQuAD dataset indicates enhancements compared with earlier studies. 
There are a few shortcomings that have been observed.
The paper lacks explanation regarding how this method can be used in situations where the response does not directly relate to the input text provided. 
Two issues are brought up through testing; 
The reason, for not including Bi An Ptr in the ensemble even though it performed better according to Table 3 is not clear. 
Is it worth exploring if this method can be applied to datasets?
Other smaller. Conversations to consider; 
The task and method are somewhat similar to finding queries in images and responding to questions; indicating that the authors may find it helpful to look into similar studies, in this field. 
The assignment might be seen as a type of "guided summarization " where the question guides the summarizing process. 
A small mistake was found on page 6 in the paragraph. There is a missing period, in the sentence "… searching This…".
Overall the paper introduces a blend of methods for extracting answers though its originality is somewhat restricted. Despite the outcomes of the experiments it is unsure how well this approach can be applied to different situations due in part, to the seemingly artificial nature of the task.
