The main focus of this paper seems to be introducing an approach involving differential changes in graphs to allow gradient descent to be used in classifying graphs in a one to one mannerâ€”a concept that is comparable to understanding a cellular automaton as a series of interconnected graphs where nodes grow with each step and include special nodes representing values within them.The suggested framework facilitates the learning process for such a sequence of graphs; however the outcomes of the experiments, on the Rule 30 challenge did not fully resolve the issue at hand. 
This idea combines elements from studies (GGSNN) improving the models ability to produce written content by using graphs as a middle step in representation This collaboration helps the model outperform current best practices, in tackling BaBi tasks.
