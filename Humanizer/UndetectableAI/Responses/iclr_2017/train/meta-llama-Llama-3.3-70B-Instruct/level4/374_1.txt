This paper presents a gating method that combines word and character representations effectively leading the way in performance on the CBT dataset. Moreover，the suggested approach surpasses gates lacking linguistic features, on both the SQuAD dataset and a Twitter classification task. 
The vector based gate is likely to outperform the scalar gate because of its resemblance to the gates found in LSTM and GRU structures in my view! The main highlight of this research lies in showing how including features like POS tags. Ner can improve gate learning significantly. The visual representation, in Figure 3 and the instances mentioned in Table 4 effectively showcase the advantages of incorporating these features—a standout aspect of the paper. 
In general while the suggested gate may not be groundbreaking in terms of technology the document presents an valuable addition that is expected to help the NLP community. Therefore I suggest accepting it.
