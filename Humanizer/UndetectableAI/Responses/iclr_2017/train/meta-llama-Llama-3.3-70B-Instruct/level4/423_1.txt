This research combines discriminators within the GAN framework and indicates that this method could be advantageous, for achieving stability in the outcomes.  
The main problem, with stabilization seems to come from the signals produced by the discriminator which led the authors to suggest using multiple discriminators to address this issue. 
I feel like this study is heading in a direction; however I think the writers could make their case stronger by presenting more comparative outcomes and strategies that focus on enforcing discriminator gradients more effectively using techniques, like GANs combined with DAE (as illustrated in the Enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching) to better showcase the benefits of employing multiple discriminators.
