Summary of the paper;  
This paper introduces the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCM) a question answering system that utilizes interconnected document and question representations along, with an iterative dynamic pointing decoder to forecast answer spans effectively outperforming all existing models in terms of performance. 
Here are some advantages of the paper;  
The DCNetwork model brings ideas to question answering systems by incorporating bidirectional attention and a dynamic decoder that goes through various answer possibilities until reaching a conclusion or hitting a set limit of iterations. 
A research analysis has been conducted to showcase the importance of the decisions made in designing the model. 
The effective utilization of co focus in Visual Question Answerings and machine reading comprehension, in fields is commendable. 
Figure 6 illustrates how attention plays a role, in question answering tasks by breaking down performance based on the length of documents and questions. 
The model performs well on the SQuAD dataset and its structure is clearly explained. 
The display of how co focus works, in two different areas enhances the capabilities of the model. 
Areas, for Improvement and Future Paths to Explore;  
The report discusses how well the model performs after 1 and 4 iterations; however it would be helpful to delve into the impact of different numbers of iterations (for example at 2 and 3 iterations). Understanding patterns and the kinds of queries that improve with iterations could offer valuable perspectives. 
The intricate nature of learning structures indicates a focus, on achieving high performance levels in their design methodology. To further enhance our understanding of these models it would be beneficial to conduct an examination of their individual elements. This could include investigating how co. Attention surpasses attention and the advantages of implementing a Maxout Highway Network instead of a basic MLP. 
Initial Assessment;  
The new method for answering questions is cutting edge, with a well explained model description provided in detail.
