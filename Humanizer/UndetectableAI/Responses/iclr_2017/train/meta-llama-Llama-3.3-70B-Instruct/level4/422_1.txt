This document mainly discusses an use of Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) in state space models and highlights its effectiveness in this area of study.The key idea revolves around restructuring a state space model as a temporal conversion in which the innovation variables act as hidden variables.It is important to mention that the prior distribution for these innovation variables remains constant, over time. The method emphasizes estimating solutions for the new variables rather than the actual states themselves by concentrating on a particular issue without delving into wider considerations like how assumptions about model parameters could be influenced by past data observations. Even though it has a scope in this regard the practical use of the approach is interesting. Nevertheless the way it is presented could be improved with brevity and clarity since the paper quickly dives into intricate details without fully seizing an opportunity, for a more impactful elucidation.
The paper and its additional materials are praiseworthy for their nature and attention, to detail.The results of the experiments show encouraging potential despite being conducted using illustrations. 
There are a couple of points that require further explanation or thought; 
In Section 2\. 5 The notation indicates that betaw=t recognizing differences. It would be helpful to mention that elements not covered within betaw=t, like Ft and B_t do not undergo Bayesian analysis but are instead enhanced using different methods. 
In the paragraph of Section 1 a notable aspect is emphasized; the act of shaping the hidden space to align with the transition models requirements is underscored as a crucial development, in the research though it appears to be a rather conventional approach and may not represent a groundbreaking innovation. 
Equation 9 suggests an interpretation that seems to suggest breaking down the recognition model into factors.However this breakdown is not automatically implied since formulations, like q(beta|x)= q(w|x,v)* q(v) could also make sense.This points to the necessity of explanation or clarification regarding the proposed factorization.
