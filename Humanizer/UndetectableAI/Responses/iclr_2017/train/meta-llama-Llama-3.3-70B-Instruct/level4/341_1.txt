This study introduces an adversarial framework for instructive model training in a third person context to execute tasks from a first person viewpoint successfully. By employing the training method it extracts features that are not influenced by the skill level or perspective differences, between third and first persons enabling the agent to implement the same strategy regardless of the viewpoint. 
While the idea is interesting and innovative and makes for a read more experiments are needed to confirm the approachs validity. A major issue is the absence of a comparison baseline like training the model with images from a perspective. It is anticipated that this method would surpass the suggested one. The magnitude of the disparity remains uncertain. Moreover it's crucial to explore how performance is affected as the perspective transitions from person, to first person gradually. One important consideration is whether the system is merely memorizing the strategy in a way that might lead to features being picked up from the image input itself and possibly capturing time related aspects without regard, to domains while still producing effective strategy outcomes. Since the tests are carried out in a setting we can't discount this possibility. A simple test to confirm this would be to use the algorithm with perspectives blurred or differently processed images and different starting conditions randomly set. 
More investigation is needed in terms of analysis as well as a comparison between GAN and EM style training methods with the gradient flipping technique used in Equation 5 highlighted as not entirely convincing, in the experiments presented without any ablation analysis comparing the two approaches.
