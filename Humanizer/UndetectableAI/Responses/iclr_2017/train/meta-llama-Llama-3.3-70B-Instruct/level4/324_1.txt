The idea of focusing on pruning is really great and the authors have done a fantastic job of delving deep into this concept by looking at pruning, in different layers thoroughly.  
The papers clear explanation and helpful visuals with utilized diagrams stand out and deserve acknowledgment as strengths, in itÃÅs design and presentation. Furthermore the precise indication of how layers and spacesre connected using the \mathbbsymbol enhances the overall quality significantly. 
The methodology used in the experiment seems reliable. The results show potential promise, for further study ahead.The inclusion of experiments could indeed strengthen the paper; however it is common to face this challenge in research endeavors.  
One topic that could use exploration is the suggested pruning standard I believe filter level pruning to be the most efficient method; however it would be advantageous to compare the effectiveness of the "minimal sum of weights" criterion, against other techniques How does this criterion fare when compared to other methods of pruning like random pruning?  
In terms the paper is nicely written and puts forward a convincing case, which makes it a pleasant read.
