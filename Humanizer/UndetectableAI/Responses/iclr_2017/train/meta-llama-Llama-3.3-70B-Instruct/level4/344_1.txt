The research introduces a learning method for handling intricate combat situations in real time strategy games by addressing a particular sub issue within the larger RTS framework effectively and cohesively through clearly defined assumptions and constraints like the greedy MDP and action encoding based on distance, for this specific scenario. 
One significant aspect of this research is the implementation of a zero order optimization method for exploration that shows potential when combined with deep learning in reinforcement learning scenarios. The rationale, behind this strategy is supported by reasoning to that found in DPG. The outcomes indicate an improvement compared to standard Q learning and REINFORCE methods which seems reasonable considering the circumstances. Yet the assessment is limited to the RTS field; it would be helpful to observe how well the algorithm works in fields to gauge its wider usefulness.The intricacy of the RTS sector poses challenges in foreseei..ng the possible advantages of this method, in other realms.Perhaps the authors could offer insight to explain why they opted for this approach. 
Some design choices seem random. Are only justified based on how well they work practically speaking. For example using the sign of w / Psi_{theta}(s^{km} a^{km}) and not including the argmax operation, for selecting actions isn't fully explained. It could be that these decisions help keep the values in a range but it appears that crucial information might be overlooked by focusing solely on the sign. The authors might consider looking into truncating or normalizing w/Psi to retain valuable data. Moreover the lack of explanations and evidence supporting claims about the significance of maxpooling and tan nonlinearity as well as the preference for Adagrad, over RMSprop may leave readers questioning the rationale behind them. 
The papers presentation could be enhanced by offering context for certain concepts mentioned in it to aid reader comprehension better For instance on page 5 where the function f(\tilde{s} c) is defined lacks any explanation about the w vector causing uncertainty, about its significance and intent A concise statement detailing its function or directing to the section that elaborates on it would assist in clarifying its relevance and context Furthermore In page 7s comment about using one 'u' for an entire episode is redundant since it has already been stated in the previous text and is evident, from the pseudo code. 
There seems to be a mistake, in the text – "perturbated" should actually be changed to "perturbed." 
After the given time for response had passed without any input or arguments presented in opposition to the initial review comments made earlier on in the discussion; as a result of this lack of rebuttal or counterpoints being raised during the stipulated time frame – it follows that the evaluation and assessment process have remained unaltered and unchanged, from its original state.
