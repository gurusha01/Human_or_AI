The article introduces a method for enhancing memory functions in Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). It utilizes Lie groups to position memory components as points on a surface while supporting training, via backpropagation.This technique offers a version of NTM memory and could enhance the development of more effective memory access systems. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
A fascinating and original idea concerning memory retrieval that provides an outlook, on optimizing NTMs. 
The text is easy to understand and nicely structured for readers to engage with it effectively. 
Nevertheless, 
The need to manually specify the Lie group could be enhanced by enabling the network to learn the best memory access strategy. 
The effectiveness of this method compared to methods is not conclusive since the comparison was done with a simplified version instead of the full standard model. 
The effectiveness of this approach, in real world scenarios is not clear because there have not been comparisons to evaluate its practicality and benefits thoroughly.
