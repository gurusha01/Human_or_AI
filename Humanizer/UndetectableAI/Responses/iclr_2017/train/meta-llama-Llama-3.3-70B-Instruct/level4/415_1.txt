The writer introduces a yet effective approach, to regularizing neural networks that produces remarkable outcomes. Importantly this method proves its efficacy when implemented in state of the art designs which is a key benefit as numerous regularization techniques are often restricted to basic tasks or starting setups that do not lead to the best results.  
This article is nicely. Includes experiments that test the technique with complex deep neural networks similar to cutting edge modelsâ€”a vital aspect because other research often evaluates regularization methods using simpler models where their advantages are clearer rather, than exploring new and difficult setups further.
