This article is nicely. Introduces a fascinating idea that makes it an interesting read.  
At glance    I struggled to grasp the complexity of the concepts presented without real life examples especially when looking at Figure 1A.    It was not immediately obvious how components like the controller, control unit, optimizer and the goal of optimization interacted. Including algorithms in a visual format like boxes, during experimental phases could have made things clearer. Offerings an outline of existing models that match up with the framework might also help in improving understanding. 
The research conducted by Snoek et al. which proposes optimizing machine learning algorithms using expected improvement per second to strike a balance, between expenses and effectiveness could serve as a compelling example to examine within the framework presented here. 
The results of the experiment are well laid out. Show how useful the metacontroller is in a convincing way which makes it intriguing to consider investigating the impact of involving more metaexperts, in upcoming research endeavors.
