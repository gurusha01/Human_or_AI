This research introduces a method, for compressi​ng images using autoencoders​ that has shown remarkable outcomes exceeding the current standards in this field. 
Advantages; 
The paper is very well written with an detailed methodology that allows readers to easily replicate the results if they wish to do so. 
The results show potential compared to previous studies in the area of research.It is important to highlight that this new technology is still in its phase and it might not surpass traditional image compression methods as of yet.However it does exhibit enhancements, over other compression techniques based on neural networks. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The process of training seems complex, with various stages to go through and the need to freeze weights among other intricate details. 
The reason for including Figure 1 appears to be a bit unclear. Might cause some confusion among readers since it talks about the impact, on JPEG which is not directly related to the main theme of the paper focusing on neural network architecture instead of DCT quantization.
