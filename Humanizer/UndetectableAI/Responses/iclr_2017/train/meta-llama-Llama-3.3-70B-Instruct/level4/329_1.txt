The manuscript is well laid out. Easy to follow with a clear structure, in place.The use of a denoising autoencoder to understand a probability distribution stands out as it streamlines the training procedure.In my view the combined training method involving an autoencoder provides gradient details that boost the generators efficiency.This strategy of offering information could be a practical way to enhance Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
Another idea to consider is providing a detailed comparison with Energy based GAN (EBGAN) which could help better explain the significance of this work, in future updates.
