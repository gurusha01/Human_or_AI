This paper introduces a revised iteration of the CNN based texture synthesis method originally suggested by Gatys et al., which takes into account not the relationships between feature responses at the same positions in the feature maps but also factors in the connections, between spatially shifted feature responses.  
The writers argue that this improvement brings about advantages such, as; 
An enhancement, in creating textures with range consistent patterns that the initial Gatys et al.s approach does not maintain appropriately. 
Outperform the Gatys et al.s method, in texture inpainting tasks. 
Enriched results, in style transformation tasks are notably improved when combined with the style transfer method created by Gatys and others.
Preserving symmetry properties around the axis of flipping by aligning correlations, among flipped feature maps. 
In my opinion a) I agree that the suggested technique shows progress in managing textures with regular patterns effectively.While the created textures still have some flaws like grey areas that suggest the problem persists.Also the new process notably raises expenses making an already slow texture synthesis method even slower.For instance a comparison, with Liu et al.s research emphasizes the inefficiency downsides of the proposed method.
