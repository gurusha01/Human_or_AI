This paper is really well done and should definitely be taken into account for approval; it has made me reconsider my evaluation of it positively It delves deeply into the examination of generative adversarial networks (GANs) which have recently become a significant method in neural networks The authors provide an in depth analysis of GAN convergence and address stability concerns. Both crucial aspects As one of the groundbreaking theoretical studies on GANs this paper offers a deep theoretical insight into the architecture setting itself apart from most other submissions, in the field The talk about GAN stability holds importance as the early versions of GAN architectures faced initial instability issues that limited their practical usage.The new concepts introduced in Theorems 2. 4. 2. 6 Use mathematical methods.While I do have a minor technical questions about the verification of Theorem 2. 5,It doesn't take away, from the papers quality.
