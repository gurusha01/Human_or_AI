This research paper introduces a method for sharing knowledge that I find quite interesting as a concept worth exploring further. The idea of transmitting attention maps of activations is a unique aspect that caught my attention. However the results, from the experiments do not show an improvement when compared to just using knowledge distillation alone. I think more experiments are needed in the IMAGENET section. If the authors could provide details in section 4. 4 I would reconsider my evaluation score.
