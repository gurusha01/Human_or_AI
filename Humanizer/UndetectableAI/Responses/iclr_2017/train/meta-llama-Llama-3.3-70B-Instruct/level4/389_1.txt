The research paper introduces a method that employs Sample Recurrent Neural Networks (Sample RNN) for modeling direct waveform signals and showcases its exceptional results in terms of both objective test Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) and subjective A/B testing results. 
However as mentioned in our conversation the current manuscript needs detailed explanation of its model which should ideally be included in the final submission. 
The authors attempt to compare the wavenet model fell short due to their failure to exceed the LSTM RNN performance level which weakens the persuasiveness of their wavenet comparisons altogether. Therefore it may be more beneficial to focus on elaborating on the proposed Sample RNN model of continuing with comparisons, against wavenet that do not provide definitive insights.
