The paper describes a method in which the best RNN cell is chosen after training the controller RNN based on the validation perplexity score and then subjected to a grid search involving hyperparameters like learning rate setting and weight initialization along, with evaluating different configurations and sizes to improve its performance overall. 
In order to make it easier for others to replicate and expand on this studys findings it would be helpful to include information about the specific hyperparameters that were usedâ€” like the kind of dropout technique employed (such as recurrent dropout or embedding dropout). This level of detail is crucial for replication and future investigation purposes. Taking a cue from the method described in "Recurrent Neural Network Regularization" by Zaremba et al. (2014) Sharing a set of hyperparameters would greatly enhance progress in the field by minimizing the need for trial and error, in upcoming research endeavors.  
This amount of specificity would also be beneficial for referenced studies, like the character language model discussed in the paper which tackles a crucial element of automating architecture search. A method that is currently resource intensive but expected to improve with ongoing technological progress. 
In the study of traditional vision and text tasks using multiple standard datasets as examples in the research article reveals the advantages of exploring beyond the usual RNN and CNN models available for analysis purposes. While it would be beneficial to extend this method to datasets for a comprehensive evaluation in the future the existing range covered in the study effectively showcases how this approach can compete with human intuition on architectural design and even potentially surpass it. Moreover this strategy hints at a way to customize architectural designs according to specific dataset requirements without the need for manual intervention, at every step. 
In terms I find this paper well put together and discussing an engaging subject, with solid findings presented in it.Because of its quality I highly suggest that it should be accepted.
