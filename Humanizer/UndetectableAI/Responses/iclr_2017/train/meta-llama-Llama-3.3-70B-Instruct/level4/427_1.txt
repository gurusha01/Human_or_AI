This research article presents a theoretical method for illustrating the components of input feature maps that influence the output decision process effectively by emphasizing the importance of features that have a notable impact on the result yet are not easily predicted based on other features behaviors. In reference to the groundwork laid by Robnik Šikonja & Kononenko (2008) the authors distinguish their approach from research by taking into account both how predictable features are in relation to each other and their effects, on the final output decision. 
The results from the experiment show how well the new visualization technique works by focusing on distributions rather than marginal distributions to pinpoint more noticeable areas of interest. It is particularly impressive that they showcase visualization outcomes for one image across networks and classes as this highlights the methods skill in capturing distinctive features for each class. I appreciate the authors’ choice to include a link to visualizations, for a random selection of images as it shows transparency and could improve the paper’s clarity if added to the appendix. 
One point worth noting is the contrast with the approach suggested by Zeiler and colleagues that includes shading square areas in the picture similar to generating visualizations based on marginal distribution analysis. The authors’ decision to employ 10 samples for both marginal and conditional visualization calculations raises some doubts since a continuous increase in samples, for visualization would lead to a completely gray image. Introducing regularization through a distribution when computing the conditional distribution adds a layer of control that might call into question the validity of comparing both methods utilizing only 10 samples each. 
In order to enhance the papers quality and depth it would be helpful to compare the proposed technique that relies on distribution with a method that utilizes grey image patches – a strategy similar, to the one used by Zeiler et al. This comparison could offer a thorough insight into the strengths of each approach and help confirm the effectiveness of the authors’ methodology further.
