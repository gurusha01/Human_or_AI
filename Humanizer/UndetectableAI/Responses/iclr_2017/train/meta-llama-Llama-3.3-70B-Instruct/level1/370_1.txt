Overview of the Papers Arguments and Impact
The research introduces an approach to training known as Dense Sparse Dense (referred to as DSD) aimed at enhancing the optimization performance of deep neural networks by providing regularization techniques. The DSD training process involves three stages. Dense training followed by sparse training and concluding with re dense training.The researchers suggest that employing the DSD method can lead to performance across a variety of neural network models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks). These improvements are particularly noticeable in tasks, like image classification,caption generation and speech recognition. The study showcases findings that demonstrate notable improvements across various standard datasets such as ImageNet and Flickrs 8000 images collection as well, as the '93 Wall Street Journal dataset.
