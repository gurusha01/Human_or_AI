In a nutshell here's the gist.
The paper discusses Sigma Delta networks as a strategy to cut down on computations in deep neural networks by exploiting temporal redundancies in data streams effectively and efficiently. The authors suggest a technique to transform any trained deep network into an optimally streamlined Sigma Delta network that conveys discretized shifts in activation levels across different layers. Illustrating the success of this method on datasets such as Temporal MNIST and video data sets showcases notable reductions, in computational expenses.
