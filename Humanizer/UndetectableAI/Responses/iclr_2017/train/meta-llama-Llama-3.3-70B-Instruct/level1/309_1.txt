The research paper presents a new advanced reinforcement learning algorithm named UNREAL that focuses on predicting and managing aspects of sensory input and motor output by addressing multiple reinforcement learning challenges at once.The algorithm incorporates control tasks, like pixel control and feature control to enhance its understanding and utilizes bonus reward prediction tasks to emphasize crucial aspects of the task at hand. The UNREAL agent has shown performance compared to the previous best model in Atari and Labyrinth tasks, by speeding up learning processes by a factor of 10 and achieving an average of 87 percent expert human performance on Labyrinth games.
