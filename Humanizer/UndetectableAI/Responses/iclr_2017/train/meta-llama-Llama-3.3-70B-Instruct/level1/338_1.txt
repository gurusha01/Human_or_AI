Summary.
This research puts forward a viewpoint on Highway and Residual networks suggesting that they engage in unrolled iterative estimation processes instead of traditional methods.The researchers argue that the layers in each stage work together to calculate a level of representation that is subsequently refined through iterations using following layers.This perspective is backed up with proofs and practical outcomes, from tests involving image classification and language modeling tasks when comparing Highway and Residual networks. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and approach in the context of existing literature on Highway and Residual networks. I have chosen to accept it for two main reasons. Firstly because the paper introduces a perspective supported by solid reasoning and relevance, within the field. Secondly because it effectively backs its arguments with a blend of proofs and experiments complemented by visual aids. 
Arguments, in favor
The study addresses an issue or inquiry through questioning the conventional perspective on deep learning and suggesting an alternate stance centered around unrolled iterative estimation methods The rationale behind this approach is strong as it offers a cohesive framework for comprehending Highway and Residual networks while also aligning well with previous studies on deep learning and neural networks The research paper is further reinforced with various forms of evidence such, as mathematical explanations experimental findings and visual aids all of which serve to validate the proposed viewpoint. 
Additional Input, from a User
To enhance the paper more I recommend the authors offer clearer explanations of the math behind it especially in Section 3. It would also be beneficial to showcase experimental findings like comparing with different models or tasks to highlight how broadly applicable this perspective is. Lastly I'd love to see a dive, into how the unrolled iterative estimation approach could shape future deep learning research. 
Queries, for the Writers
To better grasp the content of the paper I would like to pose a questions to the authors; 1. Could you offer insights into why the unrolled iterative estimation viewpoint is especially effective, in comprehending Highway and Residual networks?   2. In your opinion what influence do you believe this proposed perspective will have on shaping neural network designs? 3. Have you come across any constraints or disadvantages of the unrolled iterative estimation viewpoint that were not addressed in the paper?
