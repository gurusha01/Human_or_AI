In brief
The research paper introduces a language model that incorporates a key value attention mechanism to generate distinct representations for memory differentiation and encoding the distribution of the next word effectively. Enough it surpasses other memory augmented neural language models on two datasets by primarily focusing on storing the five most recent output representations, in its memory banks. The discovery suggests that a basic model combining output representations performs as well as advanced memory enhanced neural language models. 
Choice
My decision to approve this paper is based on the following reasons; 
The article addresses an well founded issue in neural language modeling. The challenge of traditional attention mechanisms, in capturing distant connections effectively. 
The writers introduce an attention mechanism based on key value pairs and show its success in experiments, on two datasets. 
Reasons, for Support 
The article is nicely. The authors explain their model and its elements in a straightforward manner. Their experiments are extensive. The results are persuasive in demonstrating that their model surpasses current memory augmented neural language models. Additionally they offer an, in depth examination of the outcomes which reveal a discovery that the model predominantly relies upon a brief memory of recent output representations. 
More Input, for Improvement 
To enhance the paper further; I recommend that the authors delve deeper into explaining why the model struggles with longer range dependencies and conduct experiments on different datasets and tasks to showcase how broadly applicable the proposed model is. It would also be valuable for the authors to offer specifics on how the model was implemented. Including details, on hyperparameters and training methods. 
Queries, for the Writers
Could you elaborate on why the model struggles with incorporating connections effectively and suggest any changes that could help improve this issue? 
How do you intend to motivate the model to focus on a historical context as discussed in the conclusion? 
Could you please share information, about how the model is being applied in real world scenariosâ€”like the specific hyperparameter configurations and the steps involved in training it?
