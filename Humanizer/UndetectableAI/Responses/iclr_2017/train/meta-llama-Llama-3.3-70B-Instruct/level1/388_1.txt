The article presents the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCNE) an approach to question answering that tackles the problem of single pass models getting stuck in local maxima associated with incorrect responses.The DCNE comprises an encoder that captures the interactions between the question and the document and a dynamic pointing decoder that scans through possible answer spans.The authors showcase the performance of the DCNE, on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) achieving top notch outcomes using one model and an ensemble. 
After consideration of the papers content and results presented therein. Particularly noting the substantial advancements in performance achieved on the SQuAD dataset that serves as a prominent benchmark for question answering tasks. I have chosen to approve its acceptance for publication. The DCNs remarkable capability in overcoming local maxima and delving into various feasible solutions stands out as a significant advancement, in the domain. 
The method is convincingly. The authors offer a coherent description of the coattention mechanism and the dynamic decoder in simple terms.The paper also fits within existing research literature by extensively discussing relevant studies in statistical and neural question answering.The results, from experiments are persuasive as they provide an examination of how the model performs across different types and lengths of questions. 
To enhance the paper further​ I recommend delving into the coattention mechanism and its function in capturing interactions between the question and document​. It would also be beneficial to present instances of the models predictions and mistakes to gain a better grasp of its capabilities and limitations​. Some queries I have, for the authors are; How does the coattention mechanism manage situations where both the question and document involve multiple pertinent entities or concepts? Is it possible to enhance the decoder by integrating more details, like part of speech labels or identifying named entities within the text content? How does the models effectiveness change when applied to subject areas or datasets?
