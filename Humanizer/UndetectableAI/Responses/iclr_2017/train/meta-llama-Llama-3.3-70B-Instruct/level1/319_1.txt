Key Points of the Papers Contributions
The research paper suggests a method for sharing knowledge from a skilled teacher network to a smaller student network using attention mechanisms. The authors describe attention as maps that indicate the significance of various areas in the input data, for the networks output decision making process. They present two kinds of attention maps; activation based and gradient based showing how these maps can enhance the student networks performance. The research paper showcases findings from experiments conducted across different image classification datasets like CIFAR and ImageNet well as fine grained recognition challenges where notable enhancements, in results were observed through the application of attention transfer techniques.
