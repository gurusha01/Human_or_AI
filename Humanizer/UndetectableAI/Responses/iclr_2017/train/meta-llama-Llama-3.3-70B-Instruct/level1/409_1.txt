This paper presents MusicNet—a music collection containing numerous classical music tracks that are freely available and annotated with instrument/note details—yielded over 1 million temporal labels in total.The authors establish a label classification challenge to forecast notes in music recordings and assess various machine learning structures such as training from spectrogram characteristics and end, to end learning using neural networks and convolutional neural networks. The experiments reveal that holistic models, designed to predict notes acquire selective filters as a foundational audio representation, during training. 
Choice
"I've chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because it addresses a crucial issue, in music research by introducing a comprehensive dataset and evaluating different machine learning models; secondly because the approach is well founded and contextualized within existing literature with a detailed description of the methods and outcomes."
Reasons, in Favor
The paper offers an overview of the issue of predicting notes in music recordings and the importance of having a vast dataset for this purpose. The authors also explain in detail how the dataset was created by matching recordings with scores and through annotation. The experiments are well planned. The outcomes are presented in a clear manner to demonstrate that end, to end models can effectively learn audios low level representations. The document also offers examination that includes error analysis and precision recision graphs to support the assertions put forth by the authors. 
Further Input Needed
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors offer clarity on the assessment procedure by specifying the metrics employed to assess the models and detailing the process of hyperparameter adjustment. Moreover adding visual representations of the acquired features and exploring the potential uses of the MusicNet dataset in music studies would be beneficial. It would also be insightful to include a thorough comparison with other cutting edge approaches, in music research. 
Queries, for the Writers 
Could you please provide details about the points that need clarification, from the authors?
How did the creators decide which composers and musical instruments to include in the MusicNet dataset? 
Could the writers offer information, about how they align things in the process. Like which dynamic time warping algorithm they use and the settings they adjust? 
What are the strategies that the authors intend to use to keep the MusicNet dataset current and accessible to researchers, in the future?
