Synopsis 
The research paper introduces an approach known as PGQL that merges policy gradient with off policy Q learning methodology.The authors establish a relationship, between the equilibrium points of regularized policy gradient algorithms and the Q values of the policy generated as a result enabling them to predict Q values from the policy itself.These predictions are then utilized for executing Q learning updates that're possible to perform using stored experience even when done in an off policy manner. The authors show that PGQL performs well in Atari games and outperforms both A2E and Q learning methods in terms of performance. 
Choice
