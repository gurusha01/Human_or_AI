Summary of the Key Contributions of the Paper 
The research paper introduces a method for autonomously learning patterns based on the infomax principle for extensive neural networks without supervision. The writers suggest an infomax strategy to enhance the mutual information between the initial and final stages of a neural network through an estimated formula over time. This strategy proves to be strong and effective in identifying characteristics from input data collections surpassing current techniques, like independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse coding.
Decision approved.
The article addresses an issue in unsupervised learning of representations. A key challenge in the field of machine learning. The proposed method is logically.
