The research paper introduces an approach, for configuring maximum entropy models known as Maximum Entropy Flow Networks (MEFN). The authors address the challenge of developing an reversible transformation that links a basic distribution to the targeted ME distribution without directly optimizing over the continuous density function itself. This strategy eliminates the necessity of calculating normalization constants and enables sampling from the ME distribution. 
 I've chosen to approve this paper for two reasons; first off is that the approach seems well thought out and aligned with existing research trends in normalizing flow networks while also tackling the drawbacks of conventional ME modeling techniques; secondly is the solid empirical support for the MEFN algorithms efficacy. It showcases its capability to accurately capture the genuine ME distribution in a simulated scenario and demonstrate its versatility and precision, in financial and computer vision applications. 
The research paper backs up its arguments by combining analysis with practical experiments to support its claims, about the MEFN algorithms effectiveness in accurately modeling the ME distribution and producing excellent samples. 
To enhance the paper more effectively I would recommend that the writers delve into a deeper analysis of how the MEFN algorithm converges and experiment with various families of transformations and optimization techniques. Moreover it would be intriguing to witness a range of applications for the MEFN algorithm in practical scenarios like generating images and videos. Furthermore exploring the capability of the MEFN framework in modeling distributions, across different fields could also provide valuable insights. 
I have a questions for the authors to help me better understand the paper. How do the authors decide on the settings for the MEFN algorithm like how layers to use and what learning rate to set it at. Can the MEFN algorithm handle modeling distributions that have peaks or complicated relationships between variables. How does the performance of the MEFN algorithm stack up against approaches, for fitting ME models like using Gibbs distribution method?
