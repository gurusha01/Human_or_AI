The study suggests a method to enhance the anytime efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep neural networks by implementing a warm restart approach.The researchers have tested its effectiveness on datasets such, as CIFAR10,CIFAR100 and a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset.They have showcased groundbreaking outcomes through analysis. 
I choose to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because the approach is well grounded in existing literature and secondly because the paper provides evidence to support its claims, with accurate and scientifically sound results. 
The strategy is well thought out as it addresses the challenge of enhancing the efficiency of SGD in deep learning. An important aspect to consider. The authors present a summary of previous research in this area covering restart methods, in both gradient free and gradient based optimization. Moreover the paper thoroughly examines the restart technique put forward by them; discussing its execution and experimental assessment extensively. The findings are accurate and scientifically robust since they stem from an experimental assessment, across various datasets and are juxtaposed with cutting edge techniques. 
To enhance the paper more effectively and make it better suited for readership comprehension and understanding improvement purposes. I recommend that the authors delve deeper into elucidating details regarding the hyperparameter tuning procedure as it appears that the selection of hyperparameters greatly influences the outcomes obtained from the study conducted. Moreover. It would be intriguing to have a thorough investigation concerning the impact of employing the warm restart technique, on the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGS) and how it contrasts with alternative optimization approaches. Some queries I'd appreciate the authors addressing are; (1.) What factors influenced your selection of hyperparameters for the restart method and how much impact does these choices have on the outcomes? (2.) Could you delve deeper into the impact of the restart technique on SGD convergence and its comparison, with other optimization approaches? How do you intend to expand this research to incorporate optimization techniques, like AdaDelta and Adam and what are the possible obstacles and advantages of such an approach?
