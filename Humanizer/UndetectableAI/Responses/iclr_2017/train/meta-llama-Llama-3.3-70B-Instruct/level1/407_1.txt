The papers main arguments and contributions are outlined in the summary.
The article introduces a deep neural network structure called A² T (Attend to Adapt and Transfer) specifically created for transfer learning in reinforcement learning tasks.Two key challenges, in transfer learning that A² T seeks to tackle are preventing transfer that hinders the learning process and facilitating selective transfer where the agent can choose and apply knowledge from various source tasks to different aspects of the state space in the target task. The authors argue that A to T (A to Transfer) can effectively prevent impact when selectively transferring knowledge from multiple source tasks within the same domain They showcase the efficiency of this structure through practical assessments using different learning methods and assignments such, as policy transfer and value transfer. 
Main Factors
After reviewing the paper I have chosen to accept it for two main reasons; 
A thoughtful strategy is presented in the paper where it effectively points out the drawbacks of current transfer learning methods and puts forward a reasoned solution called A20 that deals with issues, like negative transfer and selective transfer. 
The writers conduct real world tests of A22 to assess its performance, across different tasks and methods; showing how it effectively avoids negative outcomes and selectively transfers knowledge. 
Presenting the reasons, for the argument.
The research paper extensively examines studies and points out constraints in current transfer learning methods.The writers also offer an detailed description of the AOT structure which includes attention mechanisms and base networks.The practical assessments are inclusive. Encompass diverse tasks, like chain world,puddle world and Atari 2600 games.The findings indicate that AOT shows proficiency in evading transfer effects and executing selective transfers sometimes surpassing conventional methods.

To enhance the paper more 
Could you offer a thorough examination of the attention mechanism and how it influences selective transfer?
Explore how well Affect to Task (A² T) can be used for tasks, like continuous control activities. 
Lets assess how A to T stacks up against cutting edge transfer learning methods, in reinforcement learning. 
I have an inquiries that I hope the writers can address; 
How does the attention mechanism manage situations when multiple source tasks are related to the area, in the state space? 
Can A to T be utilized for activities, with varying state and action setups? 
How does the core network grasp the strategies to reproduce the solutions from the original task and what role does the attention mechanism play, in this journey?
