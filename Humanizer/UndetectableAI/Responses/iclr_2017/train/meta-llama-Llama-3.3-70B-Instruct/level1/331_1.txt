The paper introduces a method for sharing skills between agents with different structures by using consistent feature spaces that remain unchanged despite variations, in morphology. The authors outline a scenario where two agents acquire skills by exchanging knowledge and propose a technique that leverages the skills acquired by both agents to develop consistent feature spaces, which can be applied to transfer additional skills from one agent to another. 
Based on factors I've considered and reviewed thoroughly this paper for acceptance into our publication journal. To start with why I'm in favor of it – the approach is supported by reasoning and is grounded in existing research about transfer learning and reinforcement learning methodologies outlined in literature reviews. The authors present a problem statement along with the underlying assumptions which provides a good understanding of the scenario and sets out the boundaries within which their method operates. Furthermore the paper backs up its assertions with evidence from empirical studies that showcase how effective the proposed technique is for transferring skills, between simulated robotic arms even when they have varying numbers of links and different ways of being activated. 
This papers main advantage lies in its capacity to develop a shared feature space for transferring information among agents with varying body structures.The authors showcase how their approach can speed up learning in the intended domain despite rewards.Deep neural networks are employed to depict the connections, between the state spaces of both agents—an innovation that enables a more versatile and expressive mapping compared to conventional approaches. 
I think the paper could be enhanced by having the authors delve into the specifics of the reinforcement learning algorithm employed to acquire policies in the domain of interest more thoroughly. Furthermore it would be intriguing to witness experiments focusing on skill transfer across agents with substantial morphological variations; for example, between a robotic arm and a legged robot. Another avenue worth exploring is applying their approach to intricate tasks like manipulation tasks that necessitate transferring multiple skills adeptly. 
I have a questions for the authors to help me grasp the paper better; (1.) How did the authors decide which proxy tasks to utilize in learning the shared feature space? (2.) Could the authors offer insights into the design of the neural networks employed to depict the correlations, between state spaces? (3.) What approach do the authors take when dealing with scenarios where the two agents possess action spaces or dynamics?  
In my opinion this research paper makes an addition, to the domains of transfer learning and reinforcement learning.It holds promise in shaping the advancement of adaptable learning algorithms for self governing entities.
