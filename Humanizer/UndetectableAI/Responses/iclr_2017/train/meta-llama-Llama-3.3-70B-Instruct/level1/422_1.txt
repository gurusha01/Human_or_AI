Key. Impact of the Papers Claims 
The article presents Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF) an approach for unsupervised learning and recognizing hidden Markovian state space models. DVBF uses stochastic gradient Bayes to address complex inference distributions and can handle nonlinear input data with temporal and spatial correlations effectively. According to the authors assertions in the paper about DVBFs capabilities, in learning state space models that adhere to state space assumptions; this enables accurate system identification and credible long term forecasting of observable systems. They also show that DVBF is capable of handling datasets effectively and delivers strong performance across a range of vision based experiments.
