Overview of the Papers Assertions and Contributions
The researchers introduce a method for learning through imitation from a third party perspective rather than relying solely on demonstrations from the first person view of an agent or human being in a distinct position or viewpoint. They suggest that conventional imitation learning techniques are constrained by the challenges of obtaining data from first person demonstrations; with third person imitation learning one can utilize demonstrations from diverse origins such, as videos or observations of different agents. The article presents a feature extractor that can be applied across domains and a discriminator that can differentiate between expert and novice strategies in various scenarios such, as pointmass challenges and tasks involving reacher and inverted pendulum setups. 
Choices and Main Factors Considered 
After reviewing the paper I have chosen to accept it. The main factors influencing my decision include; 
The article addresses a challenge, in reinforcement learning; the struggle of defining a reward system for intricate tasks. 
The writers suggest a method that expands on the latest developments, in domain confusion and generative adversarial networks. 
The document offers an succinct explanation of the issue of third person imitation learning along with a feasible approach, for addressing it. 
Presenting Reasons
The research thoroughly examines studies on imitation learning and reinforcement learning while pointing out the shortcomings of current methods used in the field. The authors delve into their algorithm in detail by discussing the game setup optimization techniques and the structure of both the discriminator and feature extractor.

More. Inquiries
To enhance the quality of the paper further I recommend that the authors include information, on the following points; 
The selection of hyperparameters, like the domain confusion coefficient Î». How they affect the algorithms effectiveness. 
The algorithms responsiveness to variations, in camera angles and environmental conditions is noteworthy. 
Exploring the ways third person imitation learning can be used in practical situations, like robotics or autonomous driving. 
I have a queries that I hope the authors can address; 
How do the writers intend to expand their method to handle challenging tasks and settings? 
Is it possible to apply the suggested algorithm to agent imitation learning scenarios where several agents learn from each others demonstrations? 
How does the feature extractor that works across domains deal with situations where the examples are given in a different form, like text or audio?
