A Brief Overview of the Paper 
The research introduces a neural network known as Motion Content Network (MCnet) to anticipate forthcoming frames in real life video sequences effectively.The network divides the videos motion and content into encoder pathways to enhance future frame prediction accuracy.The motion encoder focuses on capturing the scenes dynamics while the content encoder extracts crucial spatial features from individual frames.This end, to end trainable network has the capability to forecast frames ahead seamlessly.
