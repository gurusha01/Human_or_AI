In short...
The research introduces a platform to assess conversation systems in goal driven scenarios like making restaurant reservations.The team outlines five tasks involving sentence and symbol manipulation for engaging in dialogues request API interactions and utilize the results from these interactions.They test learning approaches such as rule based systems,traditional information retrieval models,supervised embeddings and end to end Memory Networks, on these tasks. The findings indicate that Memory Networks perform better than established methods; however they face difficulties in understanding information, about subjects and effectively communicating outcomes to users. 
Choice
"I have chosen to approve this paper with revisions after careful consideration." The paper addresses an significant issue within the realm of dialogue systems and the approach is well supported and fitting within existing literature standards.The authors conduct an assessment of various learning techniques across multiple tasks, with scientifically sound outcomes. 

The research paper adds insights to the dialog systems field by introducing a platform for assessing end to end dialog systems in goal driven scenarios.The authorsâ€™ method shows an understanding of the drawbacks of conventional dialog systems and the capabilities of end, to end solutions.Examining learning techniques across different tasks offers a thorough insight into the pros and cons of each method. The findings are backed by scientific methods as the authors assess the effectiveness of each approach using various measurements such as accuracy per response and, per dialogue. 
Here's the paraphrased human like text; "More input is appreciated. Thank you."
In order to enhance the papers quality and depth of insight I recommend that the writers delve further into analyzing the outcomes especially highlighting the pros and cons of each learning approach. Furthermore they could offer insight into how Memory Networks were put into action like specifying the hyperparameters utilized and the number of hops. Lastly the authors might want to think about including instances of predictions generated by Memory Networks to help readers grasp a clearer picture of how the model functions. 
Questions to Ask the Writers.
Could the authors please provide explanation on the following points?
How did the writers decide on the settings, for the Memory Networks. How did changing the number of hops impact the models performance? 
Could the writers offer instances of the forecasts generated by Memory Networks in contexts where the model faced challenges like, in Task 3 and Task 5? 
What are the authors strategies, for expanding the test environment to include goal focused applications and what obstacles and constraints might they encounter in the process?
