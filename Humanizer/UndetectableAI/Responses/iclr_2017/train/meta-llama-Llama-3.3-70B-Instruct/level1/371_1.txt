The document introduces the Neural Physics Engine (NPE) which's a system, for acquiring knowledge of natural physics simulators that can be applied to diverse object quantities and various scene setups with ease. The NPE merges the capabilities of physics engines and neural networks by employing a segmented depiction of physical scenarios and a neural network structure that depicts how objects interact in pairs. The researchers assess the performance of the NPE in scenarios of rigid body physics within two dimensional environments and showcase its capacity to anticipate motion accurately across different object quantities and scene setups while deducing hidden characteristics, like mass of objects effectively.
