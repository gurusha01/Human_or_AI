The research paper introduces a method for analyzing language at the character level using a statistical model that is defined by a program written in a specialized domain specific language (DSL). The process of learning this model involves two steps; generating a program from the DSL and then adjusting the parameters based on the training data provided.The authors showcase the effectiveness of their approach by testing it on two datasets. Linux Kernel and Hutter Prize Wikipedia. Demonstrating that their model performs better than traditional ngram models and recurrent neural networks, in terms of accuracy and error reduction. 
Choice
Given the rationale and contextual positioning within existing literature and the comprehensive experimentation backing its assertions and findings, in the papers support. I opt to approve this submission. 

The study focuses on an inquiry regarding character level language prediction and suggests an innovative strategy involving a DSL (Domain Specific Language). The methodology is thoughtfully reasoned as it confronts the constraints of ngram models and artificial neural networks.The writers present an thorough description of their model discussing both the structure and meaning of the DSL while showcasing its efficiency on two distinct datasets. The findings indicate that the new model performs better than the models in terms of accuracy and mistake rate, with a detailed examination of the outcomes provided by the authors. 
Additional input would be appreciated.
To enhance the paper further​​​​​I recommend that the authors offer insights into the synthesis algorithm employed to train the program using the DSL​​​​​Furthermore​​​​​it would be intriguing to witness more instances of the synthesized programs and their interpretability and debugging procedures​​​​​The authors could also contemplate presenting more comparisons with other cutting edge models, like transformer based models to better showcase the efficiency of their method. 
Queries, for the Writers 
To better grasp the content of the paper in question and deepen my comprehension of it further I would appreciate the opportunity to pose an inquiries, to the writers; 
Could you please give information about the method used to teach the program from the DSL and how it balances between being expressive and efficient? 
How do you intend to expand the DSL to manage intricate duties like representing various languages or fields? 
Could you share instances of the generated programs and elaborate on how they can be understood and fixed to showcase the benefits of employing a DSL oriented method?
