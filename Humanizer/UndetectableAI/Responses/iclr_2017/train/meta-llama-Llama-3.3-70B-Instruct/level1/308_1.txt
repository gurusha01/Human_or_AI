In a nutshell.
This research paper delves into the examination of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) evolve during training sessions to create data sets and understand patterns more effectively than before.  The writers seek to uncover the reasons behind instabilities and loss of modes that occur throughout GAN training processes by offering insights and methods for investigating these challenges in depth.  The paper is structured into three segments which include an introduction to the topic at hand; an exploration of the root causes of instability within GAN operations; and a shift towards utilizing softer measures for evaluating metrics and distributions more contextually.  The authors present a series of proofs that establish the potential, for generating flawless discriminators within GAN frameworks and discuss the implications of incorporating various cost functions in these models. They suggest a measure called the Wasserstein distance to assess how closely the generator matches the data distributions.
