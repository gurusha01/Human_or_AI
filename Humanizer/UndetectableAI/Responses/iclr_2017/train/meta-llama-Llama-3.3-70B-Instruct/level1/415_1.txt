Let me give you a summary.
The research paper presents OrthoReg as a way to regulate deep neural networks by emphasizing local feature orthogonality instead of regulating negatively correlated features which might hinder effective decorrelation methods like their proposed technique which focuses only on positively correlated feature weights regulation instead.Their method has proven to be successful in preventing overfitting and enhancing the performance of leading models across datasets such, as CIFAR 10,CIFAR 100 and SVHN. 
Resolution
After consideration of the papers content and findings presented in a well thought out manner with substantial experimental support I have chosen to approve it. The paper effectively articulates the issue at hand. Introduces an innovative and efficient solution. 
Reasons, for Support 
The study delves into an issue regarding feature decorrelation regularization in deep neural networks It is set within the context of existing research and offers a comprehensive examination of different regularization methods The research is backed by thorough experiments across multiple datasets that showcase the efficacy of Orthoreg in mitigating overfitting and enhancing model performance The findings are remarkable as Orthoreg surpasses leading models, in various benchmarks 
More Input Needed
To enhance the paper more effectively I recommend that the authors delve deeper into the theoretical concepts of Orthoregarding by exploring how feature orthogonality relates to overfitting issues. It would also be intriguing to observe experiments involving various kinds of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks or generative models. Furthermore the authors might want to elaborate on the expenses associated with Orthoregulating and its possible real world utilizations. 
Dear Authors I have some queries for you. Can we discuss them?
To make sure I grasp the papers content correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these queries; 
Could you explain further why it might be problematic to regularize features that are negatively correlated and how Orthoreg tackles this problem? 
How do you intend to expand Orthoreg to include kinds of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks or generative models? 
Could you give me information, about the expenses associated with implementing Orthoreg and how it could be used in practical situations?
