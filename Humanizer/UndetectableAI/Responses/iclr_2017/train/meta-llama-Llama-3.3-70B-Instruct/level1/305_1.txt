The article introduces a way to compress images using nonlinear transformation encoding that outperforms traditional methods such, as JPEG and JPEG 2000 in terms of both rate distortion performance and visual quality. This method includes enhancing an analysis transformation and a uniform quantizer while also optimizing a nonlinear synthesis transformation through stochastic gradient descent. These transformations are developed in three phases involving convolutional linear filters and non linear activation functions inspired by biological neuron models. 
I've chosen to approve this paper for two reasons; First off is the focus on a clearly defined issue in image compression. A crucial matter in engineering that has been extensively studied over the years. The approach taken is sound. Draws inspiration from biological visual systems and past research on nonlinear transform coding. Secondly the paper includes an analysis of results through comparisons, with established methods and assessments using different metrics showcasing how effective the suggested method truly is. 
The research paper backs up its arguments by assessing the suggested approach and comparing it to JPEG and JPEG 2000 across various images and bit rates.The findings indicate that the proposed approach outperforms in terms of rate distortion performance and visual quality, by displaying artifacts and a more realistic look.The paper also delves into an examination of the optimization process and the characteristics of the acquired transformations to enhance our comprehension of the methods advantages and constraints. 
To enhance the paper further; I recommend delving into the optimization process by discussing the selection of hyperparameters and how the algorithm converges over time. Moreover; providing comparisons with other advanced image compression techniques, like those leveraging deep learning would be beneficial. It would also be valuable to conduct an analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method; including evaluating encoding and decoding times to gauge its feasibility for real world use cases. 
Some queries I have for the authors to help me grasp the paper better are as follows;. In what ways do the acquired transforms vary from linear transforms like the discrete cosine transform or wavelet transforms?. Is it feasible to expand the suggested approach to data types like video or audio?. How does the selection of a nonlinear activation function impact the effectiveness of the suggested method?. What are some uses of the suggested method apart, from image compression?
