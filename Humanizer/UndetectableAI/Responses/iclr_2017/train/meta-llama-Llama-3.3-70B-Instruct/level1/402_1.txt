The research article "HYPER BAND; An Innovative Bandit Based Method for Optimizing Hyperparameters " introduces an algorithm for hyperparameter optimization known as HYPER BAND that utilizes a principled strategy for stopping early to distribute resources across randomly selected configurations efficiently.The researchers assert that HYPER BAND has the potential to deliver speed enhancements of than ten times compared to well known Bayesian optimization techniques, across a range of neural network and kernel based learning challenges. 
After reviewing the paper at hand and considering its merits thoroughly
My decision is backed by reasons; the authors have thoroughly compared HYPERDBAND with well known Bayesian optimization methods like SMAC and TPE and have demonstrated its superior performance, in numerous scenarios. Moreover the authors have conducted an examination of the underlying principles of HYPERDBAND. Discussing its budget constraints and versatility in tackling various problem scenarios. 
To enhance the paper further I'd appreciate thorough exploration on these areas; ( 1 ) the selection of the hyperparameter η that manages the rate of configurations eliminated in each round of SUCCESSIVEHALVING and ( 2 ) the potential uses of HYPERBAND in various fields like reinforcement learning and natural language processing. I'd also like to see extensive comparisons with other methods for hyperparameter optimization, like grid search or random search. 
I have some questions for the authors that I'd like them to answer; (1)"How does the choice of Η impact HYPERDANDs performance. Are there any tips for picking a suitable value of Η?" (2)"Can HYPERDAND be combined with methods for optimizing hyperparameters, like Bayesian optimization or optimization based on gradients?" (3)"Are any intentions to make an open source version of HYPERDAND available and if so which programming languages or frameworks will it support?"
