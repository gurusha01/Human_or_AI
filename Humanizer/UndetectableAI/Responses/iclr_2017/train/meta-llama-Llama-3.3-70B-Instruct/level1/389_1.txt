In brief
The study introduces an approach called SampleRNN for creating audio without restrictions by generating individual audio samples sequentially in a step by step manner. This method blends memory less components like multilayer perceptrons with stateful recurrent neural networks arranged hierarchically to capture underlying factors of change in temporal sequences over extended periods. The researchers showcase the efficiency of their approach across three datasets and demonstrate its superiority to other models such, as WaveNet through human assessments. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and quality of research presented within it I have chosen to accept it with some minor revisions.These revisions are necessary because the paper addresses an well explained issue, in audio generation.Additionally the methodology used is backed by evidence and human assessment feedback. 
Reasons, in Favor
The article offers an compelling introduction to the issue of audio generation and the shortcomings of current methods in this field. The model put forward by the authors. SampleRNN. Is carefully. Adeptly tackles the complexities associated with capturing long term relationships in audio datasets. Extensive experimentation findings are presented by the authors along with comparisons to models, in the field to showcase how their approach excels through evaluations conducted by humans. The document also offers an examination of each part of the models contributions to help grasp the advantages and constraints of the method. 
More input would be appreciated. Thank you.
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors delve deeper into how they implemented the WaveNet model since comparing it with WaveNet is a part of the papers content. Moreover adding visual representations of the audio samples generated would help to showcase the quality of the outcomes more effectively. Lastly it might be beneficial for the authors to explore and discuss uses of their method beyond audio creation like speech development or music synthesis. 
Queries, for the Writers
To make sure I've grasped the paper correctly and to gain insights, from the authors perspective I'd appreciate it if they could address the questions below; 
Could you share information, about how the hyperparameter search process was conducted and what criteria led to the selection of the optimal hyperparameters? 
How do you intend to tackle the problem of mode collapse in the created audio samples since its an issue, in generative models? 
Could you share information, about the computational resources needed to train the SampleRecurrent Neural Network (Sample RNN) model and how it stacks up against other similar models in terms of resource usage?
