This study presents QRAO as a simulated environment for teaching interactive agents how to think and respond to questions in a conversational environment effectively.The agent is given a narrative and a challenging question and must inquire about relevant details to address any uncertainties and give the correct response.The researchers suggest two memory network architectures based on reinforcement learning;. Imprl to tackle QRAO issues and test their effectiveness on four datasets, with different levels of difficulty. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and approach in addressing a pertinent issue within conversational systems research domain and its alignment with existing literature, on reasoning and dialogue systems. 
Points, in Favor 
The document effectively outlines the QRA domain and the obstacles it presents by examining the issue and its needs.The authors also conduct an assessment of previous research findings to showcase the distinctions between their strategy and current methods.The suggested structures. BaseRL and impRL. Are explained comprehensively. The trial outcomes exhibit their efficacy in addressing QRA matters.The utilization of reinforcement learning and memory networks is a selection for this issue with the authors offering a clear rationale, for their design choices. 
Further Comments
To enhance the paper further t consider adding information about the QRAQ simulator and the specific algorithm employed for problem generation It would also be beneficial to delve deeper into evaluating how well the agents perform on diverse problem sets with varying depths or numbers of variables Additionally emphasizing on discussing the drawbacks of their method and suggesting potential avenues, for future research could be valuable considerations for the authors to explore. 
Questions to Ask the Writers
To make sure I grasp the paper correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; 
Could you share information, about the QRAK simulator and the specific algorithm utilized for creating the challenges? 
How do the writers intend to tackle the challenge of scalability as the range of issues and variables grows larger? 
Could you delve deeper into how the agents perform on types of problems like ones, with different complexities or quantities of variables?
