Here is the summary.
The document suggests two neural network models for machine understanding that are tailored for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and the Human Created Machine Reading Comprehension (MSMARCO). These models integrate match LSTM and Pointer Network to tackle the characteristics of these datasets wherein responses can consist of any sequence of words, from the provided text. The writers argue that their models surpass methods, like logistic regression and handcrafted features and achieve top notch results on the MSMARCO dataset. 
Upon consideration of the manuscript in question and after thorough evaluation based on two primary factors – addressing a pertinent issue within the realm of natural language processing and presenting a substantiated approach backed by empirical evidence – I have chosen to approve its acceptance, for publication. 
Reasons, for Support 
The article presents an brief overview of the issue of machine understanding and the datasets employed in the study.The authors justify their strategy by pointing out the shortcomings of approaches and the benefits of their suggested models.The test results showcase the efficiency of the models with emphasis on the model surpassing the sequence model and achieving top notch performance on the MSMARCO dataset.Additionally the authors offer examinations and visuals to back up their assertions and shed light on both the strong points and areas for improvement, in their models. 
More Input Needed.
To enhance the paper more effectively I recommend that the writers offer additional information on how they put their models into practice by sharing details about the hyperparameter configurations and training methods they used. Moreover it would be beneficial to compare their approaches with established methods like Memory Networks to present a broader view of the advantages and drawbacks of their suggested models. Lastly it might be worthwhile for the authors to explore using their models, on machine comprehension datasets to show how broadly applicable they are. 
Questions to Ask the Writers 
Could you please help me better comprehend the paper by addressing these questions?
Could you please give me information regarding how the match LSTM and Pointer Network components are applied in practice along with details, on the hyperparameter configurations and training methods used? 
How do you intend to overcome the challenges posed by your models limitations in dealing with sentence reasoning as highlighted in the conclusion? 
Could you delve deeper into the variances between the sequence and boundary models. Shed light on why the boundary model excels, on the MSMARCO dataset?
