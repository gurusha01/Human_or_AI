The article addresses the issue of identifying classified or unfamiliar instances within machine learning models. It introduces a method that relies on probabilities derived from softmax distributions for recognizing these instances. The authors showcase the success of this method across domains like visual perception language understanding and speech interpretation. Additionally they present a module for detecting abnormalities that occasionally outperforms the baseline method underscoring opportunities for further exploration, in this field.

More. Queries
To enhance the paper further I recommend including information, about how the abnormality module is implemented and trained. It would also be beneficial to explore in depth the errors that the baseline approach can identify and how the abnormality module enhances this capability. I would appreciate it if the authors could address some of these questions; 
Is it possible to use the abnormality module with kinds of machine learning models, like recurrent neural networks or transformers? 
How does the selection of assessment criteria, like AUROC and AUPR impact the outcomes. Are there additional metrics that could be employed to assess the effectiveness of the standard and anomaly component? 
Could the abnormality module have uses in real life situations like identifying irregularities, in medical images or spotting unexpected instances in tasks related to natural language processing?
