Key. Contributions of the Paper
The study explores how well different types of Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) designs can handle training. This includes RNNs, Long Short Term Memory ( LSTM ) networks, Gated Recurrent Units ( GRUs ) as well, as two new designs called the Update Gate RNN ( UGRNN ) and the Intersection RNN (+ RNN ). The writers argue that through training all popular RNN structures reach similar limits in terms of task performance and capacity per unit; the apparent superiority of gated models over basic RNN models is mainly attributed to variations in ease of training rather, than capacity differences. 
Important Factors 
After reviewing the paper I have chosen to accept it for two main reasons; 
The report offers an insightful analysis of the capabilities and adaptability of different RNN structures—a key factor, in grasping the pros and cons of such models. 
The writers present a wealth of data to back up their arguments by showcasing various tasks and structures that underline the strength of their conclusions. 
Reasons, in Favor
The research findings are noteworthy as they question the prevailing belief that gated RNN models outperform vanilla RNN models solely based their structure design differences. Than that perspective the authors argue that the variation in effectiveness between these two types of models is mainly due to differences in their trainability. This insight carries implications, for how RNN models are designed and trained indicating that straightforward architectures could suffice for various tasks and emphasizing the need to enhance training methods rather than making architectures more complex. 
The research papers approach to experiments seems reliable as it includes fine tuning of hyperparameters and assesses various tasks and architectures.The findings are well explained and straightforward to comprehend through the use of charts and tables that back up the authors’ arguments. 
More Input Wanted; Further Thoughts and Inquiries
