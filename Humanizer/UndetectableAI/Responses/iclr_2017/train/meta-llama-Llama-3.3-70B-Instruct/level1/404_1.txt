In brief;
The study presents Quasi Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN) a method, for neural sequence modeling that blends the advantages of convolutional and recurrent neural networks together effectively.. QRNN tackles the drawbacks of RNN structures that struggle with parallelizing computations across time steps by leveraging convolution layers and a simplified recurrent pooling function. The writers show how QRNN technology performs well in language related assignments, like modeling language behavior and determining sentiments accurately and quickly when compared to models based on LSTM algorithms. 
Choice.
After consideration of the papers content and findings presented in a well rounded manner with a strong focus and detailed analysis of QRNN advantages over traditional RNN models; I have decided to approve this submission for publication due to its compelling approach and robust empirical results showcasing the benefits of QRNN implementation in comparison, to conventional RNN structures.
