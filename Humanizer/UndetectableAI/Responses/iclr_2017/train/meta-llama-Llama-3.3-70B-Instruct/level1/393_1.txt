This article suggests a method for attention mechanisms in deep neural networks by introducing structured attention networks that integrate graphical models to enhance basic attention functions.The authors address the challenge of capturing more complex structural connections, within attention mechanisms a problem that is well founded considering the constraints of conventional attention based designs. 
The method is nicely situated in the research field as it expands on studies regarding attention networks and structured prediction, within graphical models. The writers offer an succinct summary of the background information and related research aiding in grasping the significance of their input within its context.
The research paper backs up its assertions with a range of experiments on activities such as tree transformation and neural language translation as well, as answering questions and natural language deduction tasks.The findings reveal that organized attention networks are capable of grasping structural characteristics and enhancing traditional models.The authors additionally offer an examination of the acquired representations and focus distributions to aid in comprehending the advantages and drawbacks of their methodology. 
This paper stands out for its easy to understand presentation skills. The authors delve into the aspects of structured attention networks in a detailed manner that can be understood by various readers. The content is presented concisely and logically with headings and sections, for smooth reading experience. 
In order to enhance the papers quality and depth of analysis for readers understanding and clarity purposes would recommend expanding on the aspects with prevailing methods with a focus on computational efficiency and scalability features specifically highlighted by the authors references to structured attention networks potentially taking longer to train compared to simpler attention models without delving into a comprehensive examination of the balance between precision and processing demands, in their studys context. It could also be beneficial to conduct assessments across more diverse data sets and complex tasks in order to showcase further the reliability and adaptability of the proposed methodology. 
There are a questions that I hope the authors can address to help me better grasp the content of the paper.
Could you please elaborate further regarding how the graphical modelsre defined and trained in the structured attention networks? 
How do the writers deal with situations when the structural relationships are unclear or very uncertain? 
Are there any intentions to expand the suggested method to areas or activities like computer vision or speech recognition, in the future? 
How do the writers view the suggested method in comparison to recent developments in attention mechanisms, like self focus or hierarchical attention? 
In my opinion this article adds value to the study of natural language processing and attention mechanisms. I support its acceptance as it offers a way to enhance current models and shed light on how language handles structural dependencies differently.
