In a nutshell. 
The research paper suggests a technique for trimming filters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aiming to cut down on expenses without causing irregular gaps in data points distribution within the network layers. This method focuses on removing filters with weight magnitudes and has shown considerable decreases in FLOP (up to 34 % for VGG. 16 And 38 %, for ResNet. 110 ) When tested on CIFAR. 10 While maintaining accuracy levels relatively stable. Moreover the authors delve into sensitivity analysis of layers within ResNet models, which enhances our comprehension of these intricate networks.
Choice
Based on two reasons. The well supported approach, within existing literature and the scientifically sound results that back up its claims. I have chosen to approve this paper. 
Arguments, in favor 
The research paper focuses on addressing the challenge of cutting down computation expenses in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) an issue in the field of study.Their approach is well grounded as it draws from studies related to compressions and pruning of models.The authors present an easy to understand description of their methodology that makes it accessible.The outcomes are remarkable with reductions, in Floating Point Operations (FLOP) achieved without compromising accuracy.The examination of Residual Networks (ResNets) sensitivity is also an addition that sheds light on how these networks behave. 
Further. Suggestions
I recommend that the writers include information about the computational tools utilized in the experiments like mentioning the exact GPU type and batch size employed for better clarity and understanding of their methodology. Moreover exploring outcomes on different datasets and models such as ImageNet and ResNet 50 would add value to their research. It would also be beneficial if they delve deeper into analyzing the balance, between precision and computational expenses since it holds relevance across various practical applications. 
Inquiries, for the Writers
The authors should provide explanations for the following aspects; ( ) How is the ideal pruning ratio determined for each layer. Is it done automatically or manually? ( ) Could the authors offer explanations as to why employing the `L₁ norm is more effective than the `L₂ norm, in filter pruning and if there are any theoretical reasons supporting this choice? How do the writers intend to expand this study to include forms of neural networks, like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNS) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)?
