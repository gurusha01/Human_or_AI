Exploring "Edward"; An In depth Look at a Probabilistic Programming Language, with Turing Completeness.
Summary of what has been offered.
The article presents Edward as a Turing probabilistic programming language (PPL). It combines representations for both probabilistic modeling and inference to enhance flexibility and computational efficiency in probabilistic programming by giving equal importance to inference alongside modeling tasks. Edward is developed on top of TensorFlow which brings about improvements, in computational speed and allows for GPU acceleration and scalability when handling extensive datasets. The study showcases Edwards adaptability by backing reasoning approaches such as variational inference and Monte Carlo simulations as well as GANs and its effectiveness through performance tests demonstrating a speedup of up to 35 times compared to Stan and a 6 fold increase over PyMC3 software tools. Additionally highlighted are instances where Edward has been used in applications such as neural networks and variational autoencoders among others demonstrating its flexibility as a platform, for research purposes. 

The paper argues convincingly for its approval based on its advancements in probabilistic programmings adaptability and computational effectiveness.The combination of inference and modeling under a structure and the proven enhancements in speed and scalability signify a substantial progression, in the domain. 
Arguments, in favor.
The paper focuses on an significant issue in probabilistic programming. Balancing the flexibility of expression with computational speed effectively by considering inference as a crucial component, in Edward to overcome drawbacks found in current PPL systems that heavily depend on opaque inference mechanisms. 
   
The paper places Edward within the framework of previous research by drawing comparisons to established PPL tools such as Stan PymC3 and WebPPL.The authors emphasize how Edward advances and broadens concepts from these platforms by utilizing computational graphs for better performance and accommodating contemporary inference methods, like variational autoencoders and GANS. 
The arguments are backed by experiments that highlight Edwards computational strengths and its adaptable nature, through various examples provided for illustration purposes effectively integrates with TensorFlow to match the ongoing trend of using deep learning platforms for probabilistic modeling. 
Ways to Enhance 
The paper recognizes difficulties, with control flow and recursion but could improve by delving deeper into these limitations and discussing potential solutions for future research. 
   
Broader Analyses; The benchmarks concentrate on Stan and PyMC ÌŠc. It would enhance the assessment to include comparisons with other up to date probabilistic programming languages such, as WebPL or Venture as well. For example. How does Edwards adaptability measure up against WebPLs backing for inference? 
The paper highlights Edwards adaptability. Should also consider discussing how easy it is for practitioners unfamiliar, with TensorFlow or probabilistic programming to use and learn from it in terms of usability and accessibility. 
The authors noted the presence of a website containing executable code; however providing clearer instructions on replicating the experiments (such, as hardware setups and dataset preparation procedures ) would improve reproducibility..
Queries, for the Writers
How does Edward manage changing model structures in computational graphs when they evolve during execution scenarios? 
Could you explain in detail the pros and cons of Edward relying on TensorFlow compared to the advantages of incorporating other frameworks such, as PyTorch that also back dynamic graphs? 
What practical constraints does Edwards scalability face, in real world scenarios? Are there model types or datasets where Edwards effectiveness noticeably declines? 
The paper makes an argument in favor of Edward being a versatile and effective probabilistic programming language with room for minor enhancements, in clarity and more comparisons that could greatly influence the field.
