"Paper Review of Learning Based Code Super Optimization"
Here are the key points of our contributions.
The article presents a method for optimizing code through learning techniques in order to enhance program efficiency without changing their input output behavior significantly. Unlike methods that use set search strategies without much information available to them for improving proposals, in a program efficiently the authors suggest using a reinforcement learning model to develop proposal distribution. This new technique uses gradient estimators to enhance the overall efficiency of programs effectively. The study showcases how well the technique works on two sets of data. The "Hackers Delight" benchmark and a wider range of automatically created programs. The results, from experiments indicate that the new method surpasses Stoke. A notch stochastic search based optimizer. In terms of both effectiveness and reliability. Additionally the authors point out that their method can be applied to a variety of stochastic search problems as well. 
Decision approved.
The paper is well justified and introduces a contribution with clear explanations and solid empirical backing, for its arguments.Its acceptance is justified by the following factors; 

The experiments are well executed and show enhancements compared to the standard in various scenarios. Controlled (like Hackers Delight). Additionally they also display advancements in settings such, as automatically generated ones. 
Points, in favor 
The authors present a reason for their research by emphasizing the shortcomings of current rule based and stochastic search techniques. They make a to understand comparison to natural language paraphrasing to give context to the issue. Furthermore the section on related research is thorough placing their work, in the realms of program optimization and machine learning. 
The authors approach in utilizing reinforcement learning to enhance the proposal distribution is both creative and well reasoned.The use of the REINFORCE algorithm for estimation is a common and dependable method, for these kinds of tasks.The hierarchical setup of the proposal distribution is carefully crafted to match the layout of program transformations. 

Ideas, for Enhancing 
The paper is well done overall. Howeverl Here are some suggestions to make it more clear and effective; 
The writers discuss using a Bag of Words approach for programs but recognize its shortcomings in capturing temporal details accurately. Potential future research could investigate elaborate representations, like graph based or sequence based models to capture program meanings more effectively. 
Scalability was not directly addressed in the paper concerning the capacity of the method to handle programs or more intricate instruction sets Thus incorporating a talk or initial outcomes, on scalability would enhance the papers credibility. 
The paper could benefit from including ablation studies to isolate the impacts of components, like hierarchical parameterization or feature selection instead of just comparing the MLP based model to simpler baselines. 
Queries, for the Writers 
How does the proposed learning approach deal with programs that have unconventional structures? Would it be necessary to have training data or domain specific features, for such instances? 
The experiments are centered around using runtime to gauge program efficiency.Would it be possible to expand this approach to enhance performance in aspects, like memory usage or energy consumption? 
Have you thought about incorporating expertise from the field (such as compiler strategies ) into the learning process to provide additional direction, for the proposal distribution? 
In summary this paper provides an addition to code optimization by presenting a learning focused strategy for stochastic super optimization. The approach is well founded the findings are persuasive. The study paves the way, for exciting new research opportunities. I suggest accepting it.
