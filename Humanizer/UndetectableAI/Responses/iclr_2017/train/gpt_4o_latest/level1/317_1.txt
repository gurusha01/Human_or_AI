Key Points of the Contribution
The research paper discusses the challenge of enhancing image resolution (SR) an issue with no clear solution at hand. It highlights the drawbacks of approaches that depend on pixel level mean squared error (, for MSE) as they tend to generate fuzzy and unrealistic results. The writers suggest a method that relies on amortized Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference and utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) design to maintain coherence between high resolution (HR) results and low resolution (LR) inputs by using affine subspace projections. They present three techniques, for estimating MAP inference; (1). Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2). Denoiser guided. 3). A density model trained through likelihood. The paper lays the foundation for these techniques by focusing on the aspects of GAN models and establishing a link, between GAN frameworks and variational inference methods. The practical findings showcase the effectiveness of the AffGAN approach based on GAN technology in generating quality super resolution outcomes for various types of images including natural scenes, grass patterns and human faces. 
Verdict. Approved. 
The study greatly adds to the area of image super resolution by suggesting a method that is backed by theory and supported by evidence to overcome the shortcomings of techniques. By introducing affine subspace projections and using GANs in a way for MAP inference shows creativity and good reasoning. The outcomes effectively show how well the suggested methods work; especially AffGAN produces believable super resolution results. Furthermore the paper establishes a theoretical base and links adversarial methods to variational inference in an original manner. 
In favor of the argument.
The paper is well grounded in the existing body of work as it tackles a drawback in current methods for Super Resolution (SR). The authors offer a theoretical rationale for their strategy with a focus, on utilizing MAP inference and affine projections. 
The experiments are thorough and varied. They include a range of datasets such, as images and face textures to showcase the effectiveness of the new methods compared to standard MSE based techniques. Overall AffGAN consistently shows performance in terms of visual quality when compared to other methods. 
Novelty and Impact Analysis; The incorporation of affine projections to ensure consistency and the establishment of a link, between GAN networks and variational inference represent fresh insights that could shape forthcoming studies in super resolution (SR) and its associated domains. 
Ways to enhance your work
The paper highlights the constraints of MAP inference, such as reliance, on representation and uniqueness of the mode. It could delve deeper into how these limitations could impact the real world usability of the suggested approaches. 
Authors propose that drawing samples from the posterior could yield realistic outcomes compared to MAP inference suggesting that incorporating a contrast with sampling based approaches, like diffusion models would enhance the practical assessment. 
Could you please consider including ablation studies in your paper to better assess the impact of affine projections compared to model components? It would provide insights, into their effectiveness. 
The paper mentions the existence of high frequency noise in the outputs of AffGAN highlighting the need, for discussing strategies to address this problem. 
Queries, for the Writers.
How does AffGANs performance stack up against the latest diffusion models or other sampling based methods, for super resolution tasks? 
Is it possible to apply the concept of the affine projection layer to types of inverse problems aside from super resolution (SR)? If yes what changes or adaptations would be needed in those cases? 
Is there a way to reduce the high frequency noise sometimes introduced by AffGAN while maintaining its results perhaps by incorporating more regularization or implementing post processing techniques suggested in the paper? 
Finally wrapping up the discussion in the paper is an well thought out approach to SR that is backed by theory and supported by evidence, from research studies.The paper acknowledges some areas that could be enhanced but overall highlights contributions that justify its acceptance.
