Review of the document

The article discusses the issue of transferring abilities among agents in reinforcement learning (RL) like robots with body structures or ways of moving parts.The authors suggest a technique for creating feature spaces that stay consistent to facilitate skill transfer between agents.This method includes training neural networks, with shared abilities (proxy tasks) to convert agent specific conditions into a universal feature space that allows for the transfer of new skills. The writers present this as a type of "analogy creation" across fields and showcase the efficacy of the approach in simulated robotic activities like transferring abilities between torque driven and tendon driven arms or robots with varied link setups. Furthermore the document contrasts its approach with benchmarks such as CCA, kernel based CCA and direct state matching demonstrating better performance in situations, with scarce rewards.

Ways to Enhance Your Work
The paper is well written in general; however; addressing the following areas could improve its clarity and effectiveness; 
When testing the method in simulations like this one' it would be beneficial to consider how well it can be applied in real world robotics settings that involve challenges such, as noise' limited visibility,' and hardware limitations.'
1 Choosing Proxy Tasks ; This approach depends on using proxy tasks to understand the consistent feature space better and it would be insightful to delve deeper into the practical aspects of selecting or creating these tasks. 
The paper doesn't mention how sensitive the method is to hyperparameters like the weight of the transfer reward (Î±). It would enhance the results to include an ablation study or sensitivity analysis, in this regard. 
Training neural networks for embedding functions and decoders can require significant computational resources making it costly in terms of computation time and efficiency when compared to standard approaches, like baselines which could offer more insight into its practicality. 
Queries, for the Writers
