Thoughts, on the article titled "Exploring Optimisation Methods through Reinforcement Learning."
Key Contributions Overview 
This research introduces a method for automating the creation of optimization algorithms by treating it as a reinforcement learning challenge. The researchers depict optimization algorithms as policies. Employ guided policy search (GPS ) to teach these policies. This enables the identification of optimization strategies that surpass manually designed approaches. The trained optimizers are tested across a range of convex and non. Convex optimization challenges, such, as regression, resilient linear regression and neural network training. The findings show that the developed algorithms reach convergence and/or improved final objective values when compared to conventional techniques such as gradient descent and momentum among others, like conjugate gradient and L BFGS methods. The research is well grounded as it tackles the time consuming task of creating optimization algorithms and adds value to the expanding area of meta learning by emphasizing on learning optimization procedures instead of specific task patterns.

Ways to Enhance 
General Understanding Clarity; The paper examines how well the trained optimizer can adapt to objective functions that it hasn't encountered before but could benefit from elaborating more on the boundaries of this adaptability in order to enhance the researchs credibility. For instance it would be valuable to delve into how effective the optimizer's when faced with vastly distinct types of problems, like objectives that are highly irregular or not smooth. 
The paper discusses research that was published on Arxiv after submission; however a more thorough comparison to this contemporary work (for example Andrychowicz et al., 2016) would offer further insights, into the originality of the suggested method. 
Researchers could conduct an ablation study to evaluate how elements of the suggested framework, such, as the selection of neural network design or the incorporation of GPS influence the effectiveness of the optimizer. 
Scalability is key here—the experiments mainly tackle issues for now. It's important to delve into how well the approach can handle bigger datasets and more complex optimization challenges, for real world use. 
Queries, for the Writers 
How much does the optimizers response change based on the hyperparameters chosen during training? For example; the amount of trajectories used or their length and the design of the network?
Is the optimizer that has been trained capable of accommodating constraints or other specific requirements to the problem such as box constraints or sparsity?
How does the expense of training and utilizing the acquired optimizer stack up against approaches, for handling extensive issues in computational tasks? 
To sum up this paper provides an effectively executed addition, to the realm of optimization and meta learning.With some clarifications and extra experiments it could have a long lasting influence.
