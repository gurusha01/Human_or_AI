The research paper introduces a technique for trimming filters in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This method aims to cut down on expenses without causing random gaps in data distribution like traditional weight pruning methods do and without requiring specialized software libraries for implementation. Of just slicing individual weights as standard methods do and ending up with sparse connections between neurons that necessitate specific tools for computations; this new approach involves removing entire filters along with their corresponding feature maps from the network architecture which allows the utilization of more efficient dense matrix calculations. The authors showcase how their technique brings about reductions in FLOP (floating point operations per second) with gains of up to 34 percent for VGG‐16 and 38 percent for ResNet‐110, on the CIFAR‐10 dataset while still maintaining high accuracy levels following retraining sessions. They also offer understanding into how different layers respond to pruning and suggest a method for pruning and retraining in a step, for ease and effectiveness. 

Main factors contributing to approval; 
The paper makes an impact by tackling a crucial issue in CNN efficiency and offering an organized pruning technique that overcomes the issues of sparse connectivity to be more useful, in real world settings.

The methodology is well explained with descriptions of the criteria for pruning (using 'I norm') sensitivity analysis procedures and methods for retraining involved in the process. The outcomes are strong. Demonstrate reliable enhancements in performance, across various architectures and datasets consistently. 
The authors bolster the credibility of their proposed approach by comparing it with pruning techniques like random pruning and activation based pruning as well as `L₂ norm' pruning method inclusion in their research work is commendable and they also touch upon practical aspects such, as reducing FLOPs leading to time savings during real world inference tasks. 
Here are some ideas to enhance; 
The paper highlights the ease of one shot pruning and retraining. Could benefit from a thorough comparison between retraining time and iterative methods to offer better insights, into the trade offs involved. 
The study mainly examines the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. Showcasing findings across other areas, like object detection or segmentation tasks would help illustrate how widely applicable the approach is.

Queries for the writers; 
How well does the technique work on tasks than classification like identifying objects or segmenting meanings, in a way that might be influenced by the quality of feature maps? 
Is it possible to merge the trimming approach with other compression methods, like quantization or knowledge distillation to enhance efficiency even more? 
How much does the methods effectiveness depend on the ratio chosen and what advice can be given for selecting this parameter in real world situations?
