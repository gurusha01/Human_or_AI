Summary of Achievements 
This study explores the issue of implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on limited resource gadgets like smartphones and embedded systems.Suggested by the writers is a method for trimming that gradually assigns weights to zero throughout training sessions to produce sparse networks with notably smaller model size and quicker inference times.The technique attains a sparsity level of, up to 90% shrinking the model size by 8 times and speeding up inference times by 2 to 7 times while keeping accuracy levels near or surpassing those of comparisons. The method is efficient in terms of computation and does not prolong training time; it can be used with both RNN models and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Results from experiments prove the success of this technique in speech recognition assignments by displaying that pruned models perform better, than models of similar capacity size The writers also delve into real world applications and offer guidance on pruning schedules and sparsity patterns.
