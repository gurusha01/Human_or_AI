Summarizing the document titled "Sparse Gated Mixture of Specialists, for Selective Computing."
Here are the key highlights of our contributions.
This study presents a type of neural network element called the Sparsely Gated Mixture ofExperts (MoE) layer that allows for selective computation to significantly boost model capacity without a corresponding rise in computational expenses. The researchers tackle hurdles in incorporating selective computation like balancing workloads effectively and optimizing batch sizes and network bandwidth restrictions while suggesting methods that enable the technique to be scalable, on current GPU clusters. The research paper shows how MoEs are effective in language modeling and machine translation tasks by achieving top notch results using models with many as 137 billion parameters. Furthermore the authors introduce a MoEs design to increase the number of experts and suggest a gating mechanism that picks a limited group of experts for each input. The results from the experiments are convincing as they demonstrate enhancements in perplexity and BLEU scores, across standard metrics while still being computationally efficient.

Ways to enhance your work.
The paper is well done overall; however the following suggestions could enhance its clarity and effectiveness; 
The paper discusses how experts focus on aspects, like sentence structure and meaning but it could benefit from including more detailed examples or visual aids to illustrate this specialization better. 
The paper discusses comparing MoEs with baseline models and suggests that including a comparison to other sparse or conditional computation methods, like sparse transformers would offer more context. 
The paper mainly talks about GPU clusters. It would be beneficial to also explore how this approach could be applied to other hardware, like TPUs or potential future architectures. 
The paper mainly talks about how models are trained but it would be beneficial for practitioners to have a more detailed conversation, on performance during inference time especially when dealing with very large models. 
Dear Authors I have some questions, for you.
How do MoEs stack up against lean models like sparse transformers or methods based on pruning, in terms of their effectiveness and computational speed? 
Have you looked into complex hierarchies or different gating methods to enhance scalability beyond the promising hierarchical MoEs design? 
Can the suggested techniques be applied to areas apart, from text like vision or speech where selective computation could also be advantageous? 
To sum up the discussion presented in this paper; it offers an advancement, in the realm of deep learning by effectively implementing conditional computation on a large scale.The unique approaches used and robust experimental findings paired with its real world applicability serve to enhance its value within the conference setting.
