The study presents a hybrid model known as the Variational Lossy Autoencoder (VLAE) which merges Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with neural autoregressive models like PixelCNNs.The main innovation is in developing a method to regulate the information stored in the latent representation to allow the model to filter out unnecessary details (such as texture) focusing instead on larger scale structures.This is accomplished by restricting the decoders scope of focus to capture local patterns while preserving global information, in the latent variables. The research paper suggests incorporating a flow (AF ) prior to enhance the effectiveness of Bits Back Coding and improve density estimation performance. Experimental findings exhibit top notch performance on datasets like MNIST, OMNIGLOT, Caltech 101 Silhouettes and competitive outcomes, on CIFAR 10 highlighting the models efficacy in representation learning and density estimation.
