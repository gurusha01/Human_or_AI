Key Points of Contribution;   
This paper presents a method for learning probabilistic models without supervision using real valued non volume preserving (real NVP) transformations. The novel technique tackles issues in generative modeling such, as precise and efficient calculation of log probabilities sampling techniques and inference methods. The authors introduce an expressive set of reversible functions that make use of affine coupling layers and a multi scale structure. The study showcases how effective the model is when tested on natural image datasets such as CIFAR 10 Celeb A and LSUN. This was done by comparing log likelihood values producing high quality samples and manipulating latent spaces in a way. By doing the research closes the gap between existing generative models like autoregressive models, variational autoencoders ( VAE s ) and generative adversarial networks ( GAN s ) leveraging a blend of their individual strengths. Additionally the authors point out uses in areas, like semi supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
