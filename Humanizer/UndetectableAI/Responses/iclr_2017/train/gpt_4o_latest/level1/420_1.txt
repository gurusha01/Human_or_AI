The research paper suggests a neural language model that introduces an innovative attention mechanism based on key value prediction to divide the responsibilities of output representations into three specific roles. Key identification, value assignment and predicting the next word. By using this method they aim to tackle the problem of information overload in memory augmented neural language models. The authors show through their study that their model performs better than memory augmented models on the Childrens Book Test (CBT ) and a collection of articles, from Wikipedia. Enough they also discovered that a basic N Gram RNN model incorporating recent output representations performs just as well hinting that short term memory is often good enough, for various language modeling tasks. The study adds value by enhancing memory augmented structures shedding light on the obstacles of utilizing reaching connections and proposing a more straightforward yet efficient foundational model.
