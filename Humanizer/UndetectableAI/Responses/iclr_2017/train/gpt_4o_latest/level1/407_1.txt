Analysis of the Research Article;"Enhancing Learning, in Reinforcement Learning through A New Approach. Attend to Adapt and Transfer" 
Summary of what has been contributed
The article presents A2TA (Attend to transfer and adapt) an advanced neural network design aimed at tackling two key issues in transferring knowledge for reinforcement learning (RL); negative transfer and selective transfer problems arise when transferring knowledge from source tasks results in reduced performance on the target task; whereas selective transfer entails utilizing various source tasks, for distinct sections of the target tasks state space. The A to T system utilizes an attention method to adjust the significance of various source task solutions and a foundational network developed from the ground up to facilitate flexible transfer learning processes.A versatile design allows for both policy and value function transfer capabilities.The effectiveness of the A to T system is illustrated through assessments in simulated environments like Chain World and Puddle World as well as popular Atari games such, as Pong and Breakout.Its capacity to prevent transfer effects and selectively draw from pertinent source tasks while adapting to imperfect or partially beneficial source tasks is clearly demonstrated by the authors. 
Verdict given is approval.
The research paper adds a perspective to the realm of transfer learning in reinforcement learning by introducing a thoughtful and adaptable framework that tackles enduring obstacles effectively demonstrated through empirical evidence and methodical approach A technique like A To T exhibits originality and real world applicability making it a significant inclusion, in academic works.

Ways to enhance your work
The paper is quite detailed and could benefit from simplifying parts for better readability;, for example the blurring experiments description could be shortened and more detailed information can be included in an appendix. 
Further validation of the applicability of AIT can be achieved through additional assessments on real world RL tasks that are more intricate and challenging such as robotics or continuous control, beyond the experiments that have already shown its effectiveness convincingly. 
The paper should consider making a comparison with recent transfer learning techniques like Progressive Neural Networks or other meta learning methods to better showcase A22s performance compared to the latest advancements, in the field. 
The practical findings are impressive; however examining A3Cs convergence characteristics theoretically or its capacity to prevent transfer would enrich the papers depth. 
Queries, for the Writers
How does A to T manage situations where the state action spaces of the final tasks exhibit notable differences, in size and scope? Could the suggested framework be expanded to cater to scenarios effectively? 
What are the computational costs involved in training the attention network, for large scale reinforcement learning tasks. How does this compare to other transfer learning techniques? 
Could the writers provide details about the drawbacks of Affect to Text technology (AET)? For example; are there situations where the focus mechanism cannot pinpoint source tasks or faces challenges, in excessively chaotic settings? 
In summary....
The article introduces a reasoned and innovative framework for transfer learning in reinforcement learning that has been supported by empirical evidence. Although there is potential, for enhancing clarity and conducting an evaluation of the frameworks effectiveness the contributions made are substantial and the outcomes are persuasive. I suggest approving the submission.
