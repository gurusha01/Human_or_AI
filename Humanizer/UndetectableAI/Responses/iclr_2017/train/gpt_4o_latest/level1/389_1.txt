The paper introduces Sample RNN as a hierarchical model designed for creating audio without conditions by producing raw audio waveforms gradually per sample basis using a combination of autoregressive multilayer perceptrons and stateful recurrent neural networks operating at various time scales to capture extended audio dependencies efficiently. The researchers showcase how well the model works with three sets of data. Speech recordings music samples and human voice sounds. And prove that it performs better than other models such as WaveNet based on both numbers and feedback, from real people. Furthermore the study dives into examining how each part of the model contributes to its overall performance. 
Decision approved.
The main factors driving this choice are;   
The unique and valuable aspect of Sample RNN lies in its design featuring modules that work at varying time scales â€“ a notable advancement in audio generation research highlighted in the paper as superior to established models, like WaveNet.   
The findings are strong and reliable as they are backed by measures like negative log likelihood and qualitative assessments, from human preference tests that validate the claims made by the model across various datasets consistently surpassing baseline performance levels. 
Your points are as follows;   
The research paper is convincingly supported by existing literature. Is firmly rooted in previous studies like WaveNet but also acknowledges and tackles the shortcomings it faces such as fixed receptive fields and absence of hierarchical modeling aspects in the past work referenced before it.The writers offer an explanation for their decisions on design elements like incorporating RNNs to handle long term dependencies and using MLPs, for short term correlations.   
The research design is thorough. Includes in depth comparisons between different datasets and studies to assess the influence of specific elements accurately.The findings from assessments additionally support the argument, for higher sample excellence.   
The article provides information on topics, like the advantages of converting audio signals into quantized form and the application of truncated backpropagation through time for more effective training purposes. 
Ways to enhance;   
The model description should be clearer by simplifying the notations in Section 2 for easier understanding. Using more intuitive diagrams or pseudocode, alongside equations would help improve readability.   
In comparison, to WaveNet the authors note that their implementation of WaveNet may vary from the version suggesting that it would be beneficial to clearly outline these distinctions and consider how they could affect the outcomes.   
Expanding on the potential for applications to types of high resolution sequential data could make the paper more compelling and appealing to a wider audience, beyond just audio generation mentioned by the authors.   
An in depth examination of frame sizes (for instance FS 2 and FS 8 in this case) is essential for enhancing the models effectiveness and outcomes analysis would provide valuable insights into their impact, on performance results. 
Queries for the writers;   
How much does the models performance change based on the hyperparameters chosen like frame sizes or the number of GRUs used in the layers?   
Could Sample RNNs hierarchical setup be expanded for tasks like creating audio based on conditions. Such, as converting text to speech?   
How does the model address imbalanced datasets such, as Onomatopoeia and what techniques were implemented to reduce potential biases?   
What are the differences in requirements for training and inference, between Sample Recurrent Neural Network (Sample RNN) and WaveNet models? 
In summary this paper adds insights to the realm of audio creation and lays a solid groundwork, for upcoming research. With some adjustments and further examination it has the potential to make an even more profound impression.
