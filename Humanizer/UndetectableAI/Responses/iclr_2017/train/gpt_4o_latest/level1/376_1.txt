Paper Evaluation

This study delves into exploring the abilities and limitations of recurrent neural networks (such as RNNs) specifically honed in on two crucial aspects. The capability to retain task specific information within parameters and the capacity to recollect input sequences through hidden units. By conducting experiments and analyses in various scenarios with standard RNN models (like vanilla RNN and others such as LSTM and GRU along with newer versions like UGRNN and + RNN) it is revealed that these models exhibit comparable capacity thresholds when trained optimally. The study finds that the task specific capacity increases proportionally with the number of parameters ( 5 bits, per parameter). The research also shows that variations in performance among structures mainly stem from how well they can be trained rather than inherent disparities in capacity levels.The writers introduce two designs called UGRNN and +RNN that demonstrate enhanced trainability in specific situations like with more complex networks.This study offers a real world approach, to comprehending the capacity and trainability of RNNs and gives practical guidance for selecting architectures based on the complexity of tasks and resource limitations.

"Recommendations, for Enhancing"
In theory terms. Even though the practical findings are solid and reliable in the papers analysis could be improved by having a firmer theoretical foundation to clarify the reasons behind why capacity reaches a saturation point at around 5 bits per parameter or how gating leads to a reduction, in capacity. 
The findings could be made clearer by presenting results like comparing trainability across architectures in a more concise manner – for example a summary table outlining key discoveries, across tasks and architectures would enhance understanding. 
The paper mainly looks at controlled tasks but it would be more impactful to include real world tasks, like machine translation or speech recognition to make the findings more practical. 
The experiments demanded an amount of computational resources equivalent to centuries of CPU time usage which could pose challenges for researchers with constrained budgets and access to resources.Suggestions, on ways to replicate these findings using resources would be greatly beneficial. 
Questions to Ask the Writers
