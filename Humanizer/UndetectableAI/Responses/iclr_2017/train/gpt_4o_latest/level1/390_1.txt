The paper presents an approach to flexible computing in reinforcement learning (RL) using a metacontroller that learns to improve a series of internal simulations based on predictive models (experts). This metacontroller determines the number of iterations and which experts to consult dynamically rather than following fixed policies like traditional methods do in order to strike a balance, between task complexity and computational resources effectively. The authors showcase how well their method works on a physics related problem by proving that the metacontroller surpasses reactive and iterative agents through adjusting its computational approach based on the complexity of each scenario individually.. The study also emphasizes the metacontrollers capability to utilize experts with different levels of reliability and cost effectiveness. Illustrating its adaptability and potential for wider use, in planning and coordination tasks.

Several significant factors contribute to the approval process, including; 
The paper explores a yet overlooked issue, in reinforcement learning focusing on adaptive computation and taking cues from human thinking and limited rationality to propose a fresh and well supported framework. 
The experiments provide empirical evidence of the metacontrollers effectiveness in delivering superior performance while reducing computational expenses compared to standard methods showcasing consistent results across various task complexities and expert setups. 
Reasons, for Support 
The paper shows a foundation in previous research areas such as cognitive science and neuroscience and includes compelling links, to bounded rationality and adaptive computation time concepts. 
The scientific approach taken is comprehensive as it includes explanations of the experiments conducted along with the methods used for training the models and carrying out tasks efficiently. By including baseline comparisons (such as reactive and iterative agents) as well as conducting ablation studies to compare outcomes (like single, versus multiple experts) the arguments made are substantiated effectively. The findings are articulated clearly. Accompanied by thoughtful evaluations of how the metacontroller behaves. 
Practical Applications; This model can be applied to a range of tasks beyond its current scope; for instance trajectory optimization and planning could benefit from its flexibility and adaptability as discussed in the subsequent section which also suggests exciting prospects for future research by incorporating techniques, like Monte Carlo Tree Search and model free RL methods. 
Suggestions to Enhance 
The paper provides an overview but certain parts like the mathematical content in Section 2 may be challenging to grasp and could benefit from clearer visuals or simpler explanations to aid understanding. Such, as a flowchart showing how the metacontroller makes decisions. 
The authors mention briefly the benefits of their method compared to gradient based optimization. Do not back it up with real world comparisons, which could make their claims, about reliability and effectiveness more convincing. 
During manager training sessions about the entropy term issue arises as it can sometimes result in than optimal outcomes, in costly situations according to the authors observations. To enhance the metacontrollers effectiveness exploring regularization methods or adjusting schedules could be beneficial and warrant further discussion. 
The remarkable outcomes achieved in the physics based task are commendable; however it would be beneficial to explore how applicable the framework is to tasks in dimensions or environments, with intricate dynamics. 
Questions to Ask the Writers
How does the metacontrollers effectiveness change based on the number of experts involved or the difficulty of the task, at hand. Do any issues arise in terms of computing limitations during training or inference processes? 
Is it possible to broaden the framework to address situations, with observable environments where the entire state is not known? 
Have you thought about trying ways to train the manager like using policy gradient techniques with entropy reduction or actor critic strategies designed for high level decision making tasks? 
This paper has an impact on the area of adaptive computation in RL and lays a solid groundwork for future studies to build upon it further with slight enhancements, in clarity and scalability to elevate its potential as a highly influential piece of work.
