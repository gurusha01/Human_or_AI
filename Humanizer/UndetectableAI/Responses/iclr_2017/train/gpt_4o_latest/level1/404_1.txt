The document introduces Quasi Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN) a design for analyzing sequences that combines the multitasking nature of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the sequential analysis abilities of recurrent neural networks (RNN). In QRNN architecture¸ convolutional layers run simultaneously across time frames while a simple recurrent pooling function works parallelly across channels in an alternating pattern. According to the writers¸ QRNN demonstrates predictive performance compared to LSTMs, with similar hidden capacities and operates up to 16 times faster during training and inference processes. The study showcases how QRNN models excel in sentiment analysis tasks and language modeling while also proving efficient in character level machine translation compared to LSTM benchmarks, in terms of accuracy and computational speed. 
Outcome verdict is positive.
The main reasons for approval include the paper tackling an issue in RNN technology. The lack of parallelism. By introducing a well thought out and creative design that connects CNN and RNN systems effectively. Additionally the arguments are backed by real world tests across various tasks that demonstrate steady enhancements, in both efficiency and precision. 
I believe that there are compelling reasons to consider.
The paper focuses on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of sequence models, for sequences by introducing QRNN as a solution to overcome the limitations of traditional RNN and LSTMs in managing parallel computation and modeling sequential dependencies effectively. 
The rationale behind the approach is strong as it extensively covers studies such as hybrid CNN RNN models and other architectures, like ByteNet and PixelCNN that can be parallelized effectively.The authors clearly explain how QRNN development builds on and expands upon these concepts. 
The experiment findings are solid and reliable as they are compared against established benchmarks and supported by thorough breakdown analyses for validation purposes. By incorporating tasks such, as classification, language prediction and translation the methods versatility is clearly showcased. Additionally the assertions of increased speed are backed up by assessments of processing times. 
Here are some ideas, for improvement; 
The paper provides in depth information; however a clearer explanation of the QRNN architecture in the model section would enhance understanding for readers, with a high level diagram illustrating the convolution and pooling components. 
The paper mentions types of QRNN variations like f pooling and if pooling without extensively comparing their performance, on different tasks to enhance the evaluation. 
The paper mentions briefly that QRNN models need layers or units than LSTMs for specific tasks like addition and copy tasks suggesting a need, for a more detailed exploration of these limitations and their potential impact to offer a well rounded view. 
Questions to Ask the Writers; 
How does the effectiveness of QRNN models change as the sequence length grows, especially when compared to LSTMs and newer structures such, as Transformers? Are there tasks or situations where QRNN models may not be the best choice to use? 
I'm curious to learn more, about how QRNN hidden states can be understood in the context of sentiment analysis tasks compared to LSTMs or other models. 
Have you thought about using QRNN in areas like time series prediction or speech recognition beyond NLP tasks, in the experiments and how well do they work there? 
The paper significantly contributes to the realm of sequence modeling with its approach that combines parallelism and sequential modeling—an inspiration, for future research endeavors.
