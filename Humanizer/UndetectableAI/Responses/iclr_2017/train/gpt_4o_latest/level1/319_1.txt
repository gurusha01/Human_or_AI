Ways to enhance your work.
Please elaborate on the hyperparameter tuning process mentioned in the paper for datasets other than ImageNet to improve reproducibility and shed light on the methods sensitivity, to hyperparameters. 
The research regarding gradient based attention transfer is currently restricted to CIFAR and a single type of architecture.system Increasing the scope of these trials to encompass datasets and more intricate architectures could enhance the credibility of its effectiveness. 
The paper contains some representations; however a more thorough comparison of attention maps across different datasets and architectures could offer a better understanding of the effects of attention transfer, on learning processes. 
The paper would be improved by a discussion of its limitations; for example the computational expense of secondary backpropagation in gradient based attention transfer or difficulties in implementing the method in tasks other than classification (such, as object detection).
