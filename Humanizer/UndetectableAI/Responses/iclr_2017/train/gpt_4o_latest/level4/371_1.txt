Here is a brief overview. Recap.  
This paper presents the Neural Physics Engine ( NPE ) a network design that models object interactions. In contrast to methods using video frames NPE directly depicts objects while leveraging physics insights, from training information. The approach is tested in a scenario featuring bouncing balls in a 2 D space.   
The suggested design handles each item in the setting one by one. Integrates object pairs into a common space to account for their interactions with each other effectively. These paired embeddings are added together. Merged with the focus objects status to anticipate shifts, in its speed. Additionally the document introduces reference points that either substitute the paired embedding with an individual object embedding or process the focus objects adjacent items consecutively using LSTM states.   
In comparison to these models tested against it in the studys trials showing the inherent significance of structure in learning simulations based on objects and their behaviors across various scenarios and evaluations. Predicting object movements over long periods accurately; handling different scene complexities with ease; adjusting to small changes, like varied wall shapes; and accurately determining object mass from inter object interactions. NPE consistently outshines them all.   
Opinions  
I have a question to clarify about Figure 3 ( b ) / ( c ). Are the inputs to the blue box a combination of the embeddings and the object 3 state vector or is the input to the blue module created in a different way, from these two vectors?   
Section 2 begins by stating that predicting the state of each object can be done independently based on its past states and those of neighboring objects due to the consistent nature of physics, across inertial frames.   
  This seems to suggest the benefit of opting for an object focused representation over the representation seen in previous studies, which could have been better highlighted by directly comparing their method to visual representations, in the work done before.   
Even though the paper recognizes its originality it's important to highlight that Battaglia et al.s work in NIPS 2016 titled "Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects Relations and Physics" also explores the use of object based representations for anticipating interactions.. While their approaches and experiments vary Battaglia et al.s presentation stands out notably. However it's essential to acknowledge the shared core idea, between the two studies.   
General Assessment   
I really enjoyed reading this paper; it had a lot of experiments that resulted in well defined and convincing findings! The unique method it introduces (though similar to the work done by Battaglia et al., 2016) represents a notable progress, in the exploration of instinctive physics.
