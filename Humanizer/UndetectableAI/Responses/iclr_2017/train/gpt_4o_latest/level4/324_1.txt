The idea of focusing on pruning is really great! The writers have truly delved into this concept and have taken it a step further by investigating pruning, in various layers as well. 
Well done with the explanations and the great visuals! I appreciate the mapping of the layers especially using those \mathbb symbols â€“ that's very impressive!
The experiments have been carried out effectively. The outcomes show potential for future progress, in the field of study. 
I've been thinking about the criterion mentioned in your proposal. Focusing on filter level pruning seems like a good idea to me! I'm interested in understanding how the "min sum of weights" criterion measures up, against methods of pruning out there and whether it outshines random pruning in terms of effectiveness and performance. 
Overall I thought the paper was well written and quite enjoyable.
