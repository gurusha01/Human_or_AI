The authors have effectively resolved all the issues I raised in the updated paper version.This has led me to raise my rating and now endorse the paper for approval."
In this study we combine the developments in variational autoencoders (VAEs) and autoregressive density modeling using the PixelVAEf ramework is discussed. The research showcases that by utilizing a simplified PixelCNN decoder in the PixelVAEf model similar negative log likelihood ( NLL ) results are achieved as, with a PixelCNN model.  
Using a VAE to grasp the structure and combining it with a PixelCNN decoder for detailed structure seems like a logical and efficient approach to address the problem of unclear reconstructions/samples common, in VAE models. I found the image generation studies discussed in the paper quite interesting.
Here are my thoughts and feedback regarding the document; 
Have the authors tested whether using a PixelCNN as the decoder in a VAE improves the separation of features in the hidden code through real experiments? For example training a PixelVAe and a regular VAE on MNIST with a 2 hidden code visually representing the hidden codes for test images and color coding them by digit could show if PixelVAe achieves clearer distinctions. Moreover a comparison of supervised classification, between the two models would add significant weight to the research paper. 
A paper submitted simultaneously to ICLR titled "Variational Loss Autoencoder" delves into a concept.It would be beneficial to incorporate a discussion on this related study and juxtapose the two methodologies for added context, in the paper. 
The authors provided information in their responses to the initial review questions regarding the structure of the study; however I suggest incorporating specific details about the architecture in each experiment, within the paper and/or sharing the code as well. The current explanation lacks clarity which could make replicating the experiments difficult. 
In line with my comments before the review phase concluded; It could be advantageous to showcase two collections of MNIST examples—potentially in an appendix—that were produced utilizing PixelCNN and PixelVAV with identical depths for PixelCNN This demonstration could effectively highlight how the latent code, in PixelVAV adeptly captures overall structure. 
Sure I'd be happy to boost my score more if the writers take these ideas into account.
