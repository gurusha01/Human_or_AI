The article introduces a memory method for NTMs that utilizes distinguishable Lie groups allowing memory components to be depicted as points on a surface while still being compatible with backpropagation, during training sessions broadening the scope of conventional NTM memories and potentially enhancing the creation of more effective addressing strategies. 
Strengths; 
A novel and captivating idea concerning accessing memories.  
The content is nicely. Presented in a straightforward manner.  
Downsides; 
The Lie group needs to be chosen but it would be better if the network could learn on its own the best way to access memory.  
The effectiveness compared to NTMs is uncertain especially when only measured against a simplified version.  
There is not proof of how useful it is, in real life situations since there has been no assessment done on actual tasks.
