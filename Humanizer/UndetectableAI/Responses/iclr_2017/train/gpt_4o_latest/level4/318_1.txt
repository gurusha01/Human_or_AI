The main focus of this paper seems to be the introduction of an approach involving differential adjustments to graphs that support learning tasks related to classifying graphs using gradient descent techniques.This framework nicely complements the process of understanding an automaton illustrated through a series of graphs.In this scenario the nodes, in the graphs increase with each step while the edges link neighboring nodes and specific nodes marked as (0/1) signify values. The suggested structure helps with understanding the series of graphs but, in our tests far this particular task (Rule 30) still needs more attention to be fully resolved. 
We have enhanced our approach by incorporating ideas from research (GGSNN) which enables the model to produce text instead of graphs using graphs as interim representations in the process.This integration has empowered the model to outperform existing standards, in tasks related to BaBi.
