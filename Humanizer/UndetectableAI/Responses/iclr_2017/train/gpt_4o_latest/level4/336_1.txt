Sorry, for the late review submission and a big thank you to the authors for addressing the questions. 
This research paper presents an upgraded version of the PixelCNN model that includes various enhancements like dropout and skip connections as well as significant changes such, as a new likelihood model and the implementation of multiscale analysis techniques. 
Here is the revised text; Key points of the contribution; 
Autoregressive models like PixelCNN are popular among models because they can easily calculate probabilities accurately without complex computations. One main feature of these models is how they show the likelihood of a pixel based on its pixels, in a causal manner; 
Earlier methods like MCGSM by Theis et al., 2012 and Spatial LSTM by Theis et al., 2015 represented the distribution as a continuous density over real numbers, in their models.However this approach has its constraints.Real world pixel intensities are quantized into integer values hence using a discrete distribution might lead to better likelihood outcomes.Furthermore the probability mass assigned by distributions often extends beyond the valid range of pixel intensities which could adversely affect the likelihood results. 
Van den Oord and his team have been exploring approaches that represent the probability of outcomes as a set of distinct options among the 256 potential pixel intensity values instead of a continuous range, like before to overcome certain constraints and improve data usage efficiency in their recent research work. 
The authors suggest taking a stance by maintaining the distinct character of the conditional likelihood while limiting the discrete distribution to those whose cumulative distribution functions can be represented as linear combinations of sigmoids. This approach appears practical and slightly innovative. Doesn't strike me as exceptionally revolutionary or game changing. 
The second important change involves using downsampling and multiscale modeling instead of dilated convolutions in the model design decision made by the authors for cost efficiency while maintaining flexibility across different scales in the model structure is justified by them introducing shortcut connections to prevent potential loss of information during downsampling process However I perceive this adjustment as incremental as previous studies have also delved into multiscale image analysis, with autoregressive generative models as seen in Theis et al., 2012 and others. 
In my opinion this paper doesn't offer much in terms of ideas and seems to focus more on explaining a particular application of existing concepts, in detail.
