The writer presents a yet powerful approach, to regularization of neural networks that yields remarkable results and demonstrates effectiveness across cutting edge architectures as wellâ€”a significant contribution considering that most regularization techniques are typically assessed under simpler scenarios or initial setups that fall short of top benchmarks known in the field.  
This paper is quite impressive as the experiments were conducted meticulously and effectively evaluated the regularization techniques in intricate models that are at the forefront of performance standards. In comparison to research studies that typically assess regularization, in simpler models revealing their advantages but not necessarily pushing the limits of current progress.
