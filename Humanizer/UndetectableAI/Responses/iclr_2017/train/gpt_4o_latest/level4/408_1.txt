Advantages;   
"The training requirement is. Thoughtfully planned out."  
Downsides;   
The project is missing benchmarks based on well known ASL methods.   
I appreciate your input.   
The amount of data available is quite small.   
Adding ROC curves for detection and including metrics, like EER could improve the assessment beyond just focusing on AP scores.   
A deeper examination of the outcomes is required; for instance by comparing the accuracy of words learned during training, to how they are detected in out of vocabulary scenarios.   
Scatter plots that show how embeddings and orthographic distances are related can offer insights.
