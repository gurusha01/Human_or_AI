This study introduces a performance model that aims to predict the time it takes to train and evaluate a specific network using different software platforms and hardware configurations employing various communication methods.   
The paper is nicely. Straightforward to understand.The authors have included an amount of flexibility in the factors considered when determining the runtime of a network such as the number of workers,badwidth, platform and parallelization strategy.Their findings are consistent, with what has been documented in literature.   
Furthermore their programming is available for access and the demonstration, in real time shows potential.  
The writers mentioned in their remarks that upcoming modifications, to the interface would enable users to upload networks and model divisions which could significantly improve the tools usefulness.   
It would also be beneficial to have network structures, like ResNet and DenseNet that incorporate skip connections showcased in the analysis.
