This study suggests that being able to deal with recursion is important for programming structures because it helps in making accurate predictions, for different scenarios and allows learning from limited training data more effectively.The main focus of this research is based on the findings of Reed & de Freitas regarding Neural Programmer Interpreters (NPI) from the ICLR conference in 2016 that learns from program trails.In this study the researchers expand on the NPI framework by teaching models through trails that involve repeated calls. They show how accuracy can be confirmed by testing the acquired software on a group of basic examples and simplification guidelines.It is noteworthy that they highlight how the NPI framework can accurately deduce answers for challenges such, as Bubblesort and the Tower of Hanoi. 
The authors highlight the nature of the concept in their work and recognize that the key changes are found in the execution traces given to the training process.I'm unsure about the significance of this study.Does this imply that solving programming issues becomes easy once execution traces are accessible?(If so did the problem lack complexity, from the start?)For example a harder input area could be working with MNIST digits as mentioned by another reviewer. Picture a situation where the NPI needs to arrange MNIST digits in descending order as a learning task scenario to separate the recognition of the digits from figuring out the program logic by utilizing execution traces.This simplifies the challenge to learning how to recognize MNIST digits and performing symbolic bubble sorting.Can you provide an instance of a problem where access, to execution tracess available but cannot be resolved using this method?
