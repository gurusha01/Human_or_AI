This study customizes a soft mixture of experts model to tackle a particular transfer learning issue in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on transferring action policies and value functions across related tasks. Though the experimental design resembles RL methods to some extent​ the exploration of this connection is limited​​​—a potential area, for further investigation​​​. 
This study suggests that of manual design by the experimeter guiding the choice of architecture and learning algorithm for a tasks objective is an interesting idea, for future research directions. 
I'm sorry. I cannot proceed without the input text that needs to be paraphrased. Please provide the text for me to rewrite it in a human like manner.
Advantages; 
The article thoroughly explains how the new network design works with reinforcement learning frameworks to support further research in this field.   
I believe the experiments provide evidence of the concept but fall short of further implications in my view.   
The results indicate that groups of networks that are trained on similar tasks perform better when used together for related tasks compared to conventional transfer learning techniques such, as fine tuning. 
I'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased response, without the original text to work on. If you provide me with the input text I can then paraphrase it for you.
I'm only seeing aspects.
In the section discussing studies on the topic mentioned earlier in this work; it has been suggested in past research to utilize pre existing policy libraries for training on tasks with similar characteristics as a formal approach to achieve this goal effectively. Within the realm of reinforcement learning literature exists a common understanding that leveraging existing fixed (for example Fernandez & Veloso 2006) or jointly acquired policies that cater to specific sections of the state space (such as options, by Pricop et al.) can prove beneficial. Nevertheless; creating libraries poses a persistent challenge that has yet to be adequately addressed; unfortunately; this paper does not offer substantial insights into resolving this particular issue.   
The selected transfer tasks effectively demonstrate the capabilities of the suggested framework; however the study fails to consider transfer or reusing compositions, in difficult scenarios as highlighted in earlier literature (for example; Parisotto et al., 2015; Rusuet al., 2015; 2016).  
The main focus is on findings here; it'd be interesting to check how the outcomes in Figures 6 and 7 stack up when shown over time as it passes by normally. Efficiency of information isn't an aspect to nail perfect gameplay, in Pong (refer to Mnih et al., 2015) so it'd give us better insights to assess tasks where how well you do is limited by the amount of available information. Furthermore it would be intriguing to examine whether the outcomes presented could be attained using computational resources or smaller representations sizes compared to starting from scratch specially in cases where one of the source tasks is a policy already taught for the target task.   
I must say it's a bit disheartening that the model needs a quarter of the data necessary to master Pong from the beginning just to find out that there's already an ideal Pong strategy, in the expert library. By testing each expert across 10 rounds and then pooling their action choices based on average scores could probably yield comparable results using way less data.
