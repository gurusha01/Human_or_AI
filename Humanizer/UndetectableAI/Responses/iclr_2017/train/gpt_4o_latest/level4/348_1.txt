This research delves into the exploration of transformation groups in relation, to convolutional neural networks (convnets). It also showcases findings illustrating the enhanced optimization of network parameters. 
The idea of steerability is quite intriguing. Seems like a valuable concept worth delving into further depth.However this concept is not novel in image processing; it has roots dating back to the efforts of Simoncelli,Freeman,AdeIson,Perrona,Greenspan and others in the 1990s.This study revisits this concept, from the perspective of group theory. Provides a formal analysis. Ultimately the main idea seems simple ; a changed images feature representation should match the transformed feature representation of the image. The authors focus on groupings like rotations, at 0 90, 180 and 270 degrees making the group theoretic approach seem a bit overly technical. It's not really clear what benefits this approach offers in real world applications. It appears that the main difficulty is dealing with changes; if the theoretical structure can tackle this issue effectively it could have a significantly greater impact. 
The section detailing the experiment seems unclear in its explanation.The replication of the authorsâ€™ utilization of capsules or transformation groups based on the given information would pose a challenge.
