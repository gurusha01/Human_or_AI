The research paper presents a Sample based Recurrent Neural Network (Sample RNN) that aims to accurately capture waveform data to show better results, in objective testing NLL and subjective A/B comparisons. 
In the discussion section of the paper mentioned earlier there is a need, for detailed description of the proposed model. It is anticipated that this matter will be taken care of in the submission. 
The authors tried to measure their method against the WaveNet model. Couldn't outperform the basic LSTM RNN model that weakens the effectiveness of comparing it to WaveNet properly. Instead of investing effort into comparing with WaveNet further s it would be more advantageous to concentrate on elaborating the proposed model, in more depth.
