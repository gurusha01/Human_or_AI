This study presents a technique for integrating secondary tasks into a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent like A2Differently from what you've written0Feneticist sources and assesses their method in Labyrinth and Atari settings.a The suggested UNBELIEVABLE agent shows advancements over A2Differently from what you've written0Feneticist sources in terms of both performance and learning speed.a This is an addition to the conference discussion.a Howevera which is surprisinga the outcomes are not highly unexpecteda, as including relevant secondary tasks is predicted to improve and hasten feature acquisitiona This project acts as a demonstration of this idea. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to understand for readers knowledgeable, about deep reinforcement learning. 
Can the writers share details, about the computing power needed to train the UNREAL agent? 
The structure of the system seems intricate do you think the authors will share the code for their model? 
I'm sorry. I cannot fulfill your request to paraphrase the text without the actual content to work on. Please provide the input text for me to rewrite in a like manner.
