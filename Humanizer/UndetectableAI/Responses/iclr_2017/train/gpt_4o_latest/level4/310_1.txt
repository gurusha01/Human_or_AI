"Thank you for the inspiring contribution."
Advantages  
This essay delves into an foundational issue. Grasping the interaction between two individuals. With the expansion of reinforcement learning into fields this study reexamines a key inquiry. Do machines solve problems in a way similar, to humans?   
The tasks simplicity enables an analysis, after learning.   
It was interesting to see how knowledgeable individuals used symbols to communicate ideas while those who were unsure relied only on two symbols.   
Downsides  
When two different images are provided and they fall into categories the task becomes similar to solving an image classification challenge. In these instances the symbols represent the categories of the images which the second participant learns to link with the images. Consequently this method bears a resemblance, to a transfer learning scenario, which might offer a more effective training approach compared to utilizing reinforcement learning techniques.
