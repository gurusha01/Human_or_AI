This research paper presents a model that is created to understand perspectives of objects simultaneously by utilizing a triplet loss mechanism that ensures similar views of an object are closer in the learned feature space compared to views of different objects in an image format. The effectiveness of this approach is tested in tasks related to retrieving object instances and categories. Is compared against standard CNN models (such as untrained AlexNet and AlexNet fine tuned for classification by categories ) using fc7 features, with cosine distance. Furthermore in the paper is an analysis comparing " objects‚Äù, with how humans perceive them.
Strengths include the introduction of a triplet loss, which adds a touch of uniqueness to the problem, at hand although its novelty might be somewhat restricted given research as discussed later in the paper and it is presented in a fairly understandable way. 
The paper has areas for improvement, such as the absence of references to prior research in this field and the need for a clear comparison, with an already established method.

The paper on "image purification' is closely related to the work, at hand. 
The work titled "Joint Embeddings of Shapes and Images, via CNN Image Purification" was presented by Hao Su and his co authors at the SIGGRAPH Asia conference in 2015. 
The previous research has focused on linking CNN characteristics to field descriptors of 3D shapes to facilitate object retrieval that remains consistent across different views. It would be beneficial to include a contrast with this method in the papers discussion section to enhance its credibility and relevance. Moreover the availability of code and data for [Reference A] seems to be open, to the public as indicated.
