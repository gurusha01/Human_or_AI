This research paper presents the idea of integrating discriminators into GAN models, for improved performance and stability as indicated by the outcomes obtained from the study. 
The main issue, with stabilization appears to be related to the signals coming from the discriminator according to the text analysis experts findings.They are working on resolving this concern by utilizing discriminators to reduce its influence. 
The suggested path forward seems hopeful to me! Yet I recommend that the writers incorporate comparisons with different methods that enhance the discriminator gradients, like GAN combined with DAE (Enhancing Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoise Feature Matching) to emphasize more effectively the benefits of employing multiple discriminators.
