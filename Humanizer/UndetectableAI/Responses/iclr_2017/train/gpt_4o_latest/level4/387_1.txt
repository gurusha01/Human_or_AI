The paper introduces a change to the texture synthesis method using CNNs by Gatys and others which includes comparing correlations among shifted feature responses as well as correlations among feature responses, at matching spatial locations within the feature maps.  
The writers claim that this alteration;   
It improves the creation of textures, with regular patterns that aren't effectively maintained by the Gatys et al.s approach.   
enhances results in filling in textures compared to the approach, by Gatys and colleagues   
Integrating c improves outcomes during transitions when combined with the style transfer approach, by Gatys and colleagues.  
Matching the correlations, between flipped feature maps helps to maintain symmetry properties around the flipping axis.   
"I agree with point a). Although the created textures show some flaws, like grey patches which suggests that the issue is not fully resolved yet."
