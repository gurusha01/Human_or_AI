This research paper presents a technique to improve the performance of neural networks handling sequences of related inputs by focusing on computing only what is needed to detect differences between consecutive inputs effectively.This paper is well crafted; the new approach suggested is creative. Its fascinating to see a real world algorithm influenced by spiking networks principles.However the benefits of this method seem theoretical, than practical for now since applying it to existing hardware may not lead to substantial advantages. In my opinion if we use a sparsity penalty when training deep networks it could lead to a significant decrease, in computational requirements.
