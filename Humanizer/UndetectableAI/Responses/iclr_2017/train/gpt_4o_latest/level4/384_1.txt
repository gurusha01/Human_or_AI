The paper discusses how to find where an answer is located in a text when the answer is already part of the text input. The authors suggest combining two models – Match LSTM for aligning question and text representations. Pointer Net for predicting the answers position, in the text. 
Advantages; 
The suggested approach is ideal, for the job. Showcases impressive outcomes (although its worth noting that other recent studies have managed to achieve even better results).
The method was tested using the dataset and demonstrated significant enhancements compared with earlier techniques. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper doesn't clearly explain how well the method works in situations where the solution is not directly stated in the input text. 

   Its puzzling why Bi Anseptr isn't part of the ensemble despite its performance, in Table 20. 
   It would be intriguing to see if this method works well with sets of data. 
Other (small points, for discussion);
There are some similarities in the concepts between the task and method of finding queries in images and answering questions so the authors might consider referring to related research, in these areas. 
It might be valuable to explore if this assignment could be seen as a type of "guided summarization " where the query guides the summarizing procedure. 
On page 6 in the paragraph of the document mentioned a missing period, in the sentence "… searching This…".
Could you please provide the text or context for me to paraphrase? Thank you.
The study presents a blend of two established techniques for answer extraction; however the degree of originality is moderate at best.Its experimental findings show potential. It is unclear how adaptable the approach is, to different scenarios given the artificial nature of the task at hand.
