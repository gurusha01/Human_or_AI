This article presents an fascinating method for tackling the difficulties associated with conducting inference, on HSMMs.The incorporation of an embedded bi RNN to estimate the posterior is an imaginative concept. 
I think there are two areas that could use some fine tuning.
The paper would benefit from explaining why using a RNN can produce more precise estimates than other modeling methods like structured mean field with a sequential model for defining the variational distribution. Providing a rationale, for choosing this model over others would improve the papers overall effectiveness. 
In the experiments it seems that the actual datasets are quite small with than 100 sequences, for example. Enhancing the papers impact could involve presenting findings on larger datasets.
