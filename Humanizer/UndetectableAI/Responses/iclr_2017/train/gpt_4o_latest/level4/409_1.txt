This article introduces MusicNet – a dataset that fills a crucial gap in the application of machine learning to music research by providing well annotated and carefully curated music data with controlled genre diversity for practical use, within the community. 
The validation of the dataset is clearly. Showcases a methodical and careful procedure. 
The researchers present a series of experiments that demonstrate the extensive size of the dataset and prove that important basic characteristics (such, as anticipated sinusoidal patterns ) can be acquired within an integrated framework. 
The main significance of this work may not solely rest in the experiments or methods used but in the quality of the dataset itself – a crucial factor that cannot be emphasized enough in research advancement and setting standards for future progress, in the field given the difficulty and scarcity of such high caliber resources available. If the community consistently created datasets of this caliber on a basis the situation might vary.. That's not the situation right now to be honest.In short the experiments and methods might not meet the 50 percent of accepted papers as per the review criteria.However I'd say that the dataset itself likely lands, in the 15 percent or higher.
