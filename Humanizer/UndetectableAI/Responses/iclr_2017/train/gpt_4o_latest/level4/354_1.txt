This research presents a technique to effectively create a group of networks that outperform a lone network trained for the equivalent period of time.The central concept includes using a learning rate to quickly direct the model towards a nearby minimum point before capturing a snapshot of the model at that stage and then elevating the learning rate to move away, towards another minimums area of attraction. During one training session of collection snapshots here show good performance compared to standard methods and showcase a few advantages of old school ensembles but with much lower computational demands. 
The article is nicely written with insightful graphs and tables and showcases compelling findings across various models and datasets.I especially found the analysis in Section 3 impressive.Furthermore the provision of accessible code, for reproducibility is truly admirable. 
It might be an idea to delve into a thorough analysis of the precision and consistency of each snapshot and also compare them more extensively with traditional ensemble methods. 
Initial assessment;   
This work is quite impressive backed by experimental proof and presented clearly. 
Just a small note.  
In Figure 5. Why is the lambda axis range, from. 3 To 4 when lambda naturally ranges between 0 and 10?
