This study delves into using flows (NF) a technique that allows for creating intricate probability distributions, with manageable likelihood values when tackling maximum entropy (MaxEnt) constrained optimization scenarios. 
The document is nicely. Easy to comprehend. 
The originality of this study is somewhat constrained in scope as the key advancements lie in two areas; utilizing established methods related to NF for addressing the MaxEnt estimation issue and dealing with specific optimization hurdles resulting from stochastic approximations to E [|| T ||] along with the adjustment of Lagrange multipliers.However the application of NF for MaxEnt estimation lacks creativity within a framework.For instance a loss equivalent to the loss, in equation could be derived instead. In studies that use Normalizing Flows for variational inference the approach involves reducing the difference, between certain probability distributions through a process called Kullback Leibler divergence (referred to as KLD). This method aims to adjust the likelihood function f so that it corresponds to a sum adjusted using predefined factors and terms related to T_k values.  
The papers results could be improved by conducting experiments using intricate datasets instead of focusing solely 	on the two experiments that were showcased which only tackled simple issues. 
Just a quick note; 
While the eighth step of algorithm 1 seems straightforward, at glance it would be helpful to briefly talk about it.
