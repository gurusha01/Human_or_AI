This article introduces a combination of a memory network and reinforcement learning method in a way that raises some interesting questions, about its reliability and originality based upon the clear experimental results provided. 
How well does the model handle situations, with variables in a single sentence? 
What does the model do when it encounters a question that is not covered in its vocabulary? 
The authors should delve deeper into analyzing the curriculum learning aspect since it's crucial, for training the RL model effectively. 
Were the data samples chosen randomly or gradually during training, for each iterationâ€”starting from one depth examples and moving on to more complex multi depth ones?
