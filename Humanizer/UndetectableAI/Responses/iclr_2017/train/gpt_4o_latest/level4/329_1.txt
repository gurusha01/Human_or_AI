This article is well written and nicely laid out in my opinion.The suggested technique uses a denoising autoencoder to understand a probability distribution which helps simplify the training processâ€”an admirable strategy.In my view pairing the training with an autoencoder provides supportive gradient details that boost the generators effectiveness.Integrating information may be a useful tactic to enhance GANs performance. 
Additional note;   
In the version it would be beneficial to have a more thorough exploration of EBGAN.
