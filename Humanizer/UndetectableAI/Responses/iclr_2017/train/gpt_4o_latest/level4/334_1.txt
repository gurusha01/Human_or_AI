This study presents a case for fine tuning the position and dimensions of receptive fields in an artificial eye that can perform quick eye movements (saccades). This optimization is aimed at reducing classification errors in image data containing subimages of varying sizes and locations with label dependencies. The findings suggest an insight into why there is a high resolution region like the fovea found in certain species such, as primates retinas. 
The argument could be made stronger by using practical image collections and creating a clearer link with the quantities and characteristics of retinal cells in animals, like the macaque monkey. However this would bring up the issue of finding a loss function that's biologically believable while also backing up the authors’ assertions. 
Moreover， it would help to talk about the timeframes considered in the argument as well． The density of the central vision area is probably affected by the number of quick eye movements, during decision making， the dimensions of the specific image segments， and how they affect the accuracy of classification in general．
The high 24% error rate in Dataset 2 is. Indicates that the model might not be working correctly as intended according to the papers main argument that implies the model can be trained effectively for classification tasks. It raises a question, about why our eyes and visual cortex didn't evolve to adopt mechanisms to alternative training strategies or models that perform better and operate differently under similar optimization pressures. 
Why is it that the model with zoom features performs better than the translation model in Dataset 1 (where all target images have the same size) but only matches its performance in Dataset 2 (where target images come in varying sizes that would seemingly benefit the zoom feature more)? This unexpected parity between the models in Dataset 2 and the high error rate, in classification raise worries that perhaps neither model was optimized fully during training sessions. A factor that could potentially undermine the credibility of the papers assertions. 
Although discussing this model in relation to attention mechanisms like spatial transformer networks and DRAW may not be the main focus of the paper per se; however such comparisons could potentially assist in tackling worries regarding less than ideal training or possible problems, with model parameterization that could potentially be resolved quite easily.
