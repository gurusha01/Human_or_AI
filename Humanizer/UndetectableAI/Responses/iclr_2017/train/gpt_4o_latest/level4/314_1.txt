Advanced deep reinforcement learning methods have been highly effective in solving challenges in extensive environments by utilizing deep neural networks to approximate functions in RL algorithms.The practical study discussed here expands on these techniques by presenting an algorithm that showcases outstanding results in unfamiliar 3D settings through the utilization of raw sensory information.It also enhances adaptability, across objectives and scenarios.This particular algorithm has notably emerged victorious in the Visual Doom AI contest. 
The key advancement of the algorithm is its incorporation of extra simplified observations (like ammunition or health from the game system) which serve as supervised targets for forecasting purposes. An essential aspect is that these forecasts are influenced by a goal vector (provided instead of being learned) along with the current action taken. After the model is educated through training processes; the best course of action, in a situation is identified by choosing the action that yields the highest projected result concerning the intended goal. This method uses learning instead of successor feature representations and does not involve any temporal difference (TD) relationship, between the predictions of the current and future states. 
The writers thoroughly examine studies in section 2 of the paper by looking into research on forecasting future conditions as part of reinforcement learning and goal oriented function approximators. The main highlights of this study are its focus on Monte Carlo estimation than TD methods the utilization of simplified "metrics‚Äù, for prediction the integration of parameterized objectives and notably comparing their findings with relevant existing methods empirically. 
The authors not showcased their achievements in the Visual Doom AI competition but also illustrated how their algorithm can acquire adaptable strategies that can adjust to slight changes in objectives without the need, for extra training sessions. 
The research paper is nicely crafted with empirical evidence that adds significant value to the field. 
Here are a few small recommendations, for enhancement; 
During training using an approximation method in an online learning scenario with a replay buffer involved is a key aspect to consider in the Monte Carlo regression technique where the assumption is that the rest of the path aligns, with the current policy even though data comes from episodes created by past policy iterations; it's important to address this approximation explicitly. 
The algorithm depends upon metadata (for example; recognizing which parts of the sensory input are valuable to forecast) a feature that other algorithms, in the same category do not take advantage of. The writers should acknowledge this reliance in a manner and address the drawbacks of their method by discussing its possible inefficacy in environments where such measurements are not accessible.
