The article presents a method, for tackling the super resolution issue using amortized MAP inference and includes a pre trained affine projection layer to maintain LR output consistency effectively.The paper also suggests three strategies to reduce cross entropy levels.I find this paper quite impressive; nonetheless I do have a thoughts to share; 
The new approach for spread out MAP inference is original. Stands out from previous methods, for single image resolution (SR). When integrated with GAN technology in this model produces top notch outcomes.. When matched against another GAN powered SR technique named "Photo realistic Single Image Super resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network " doubts may emerge concerning the precise advancements offered by this fresh approach to the latest cutting edge technology. 
By using an affine projection structure as a limitation factor in the models operation process removes the necessity, for matching {HR and LR images when training}. Nevertheless the training of the affine projection layer itself still necessitates {HR and LR image pairs}. Does this suggest that the training prerequisite has merely been transferred to the affine projection layer? 
Could the authors add results from super resolution test datasets like Set 14 or BSD100 in the paper to compare with previous studies effectively alongside their frameworks results, on ImageNets natural images? 
The findings in the paper focus up to a resolution of 128Ã—128, for real life images but can this model efficiently process bigger image dimensions too given that super resolution tasks frequently deal with inputs of various sizes? 
Did the researchers try adding a noise vector when working on the Standard GAN model to improve distribution modeling, in the space? 
In essence this article presents a SR framework backed by thorough theoretical examination. The concepts are innovative. The authors delve into various approaches. Nevertheless there are lingering uncertainties about the need and further tests that could enhance the study. Nevertheless I am of the opinion that this article will be a source of motivation, for the research field.
