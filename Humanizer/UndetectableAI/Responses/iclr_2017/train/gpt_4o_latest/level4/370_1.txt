Training neural networks with complex structures poses a significant real world hurdle to overcome; this study offers a thorough exploration of an innovative strategy to enhance training effectiveness.The practical outcomes outlined in the paper. The authorsâ€™ feedback, in subsequent discussions effectively highlight how the suggested technique consistently enhances accuracy across different designs and applications. The process of the algorithm is simple (switching between training the dense network and a sparse version) making it more likely to be embraced by researchers, in the field. 
The paper could use some improvements to incorporate the experiments and perspectives discussed during the meeting. Especially the accuracy comparisons, with an equal number of training epochs.
