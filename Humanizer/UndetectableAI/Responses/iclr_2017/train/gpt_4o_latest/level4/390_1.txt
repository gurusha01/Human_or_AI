The article is nicely crafted and offers a perspectiveâ€”I truly found it engaging to read. 
I had some trouble grasping the formality of it all without real life examples to illustrate the concepts better in Figure 1A breakdowns were a bit confusing, at glance What exactly do the controller and optimizer represent and what are they optimizing in different scenarios It might have helped to include algorithm boxes especially when discussing your experiments Adding examples of similar models that fit within your framework could also make things clearer 
In their research about the application of Bayesian Optimization in Machine Learning techniques Snoek and his colleagues propose optimizing algorithms considering the balance between computational expenses and performance enhancements by assessing the expected improvement per second metric. It might be worth investigating how well these strategies align, with your existing framework. 
The findings, from the experiment were presented in an impactful manner showing the effectiveness of the metacontroller convincingly.I am curious to know the results when including a range of metaexperts.
