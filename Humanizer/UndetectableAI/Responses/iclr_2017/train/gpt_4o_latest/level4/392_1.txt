This research paper presents a technique for compress The paper introduces an innovative approach to image compression using autoencoders The results from the experiments are quite impressive and exceed the existing standards, in this field. 
Advantages; 
The paper is very clear and easy to understand; this makes it possible for others to reproduce the results if they wish to do. 
The findings look promising compared to research in this field and show potential, for being innovative technology worth emphasizing. A point the authors could have stressed more directly in their work here. The novelty of this technology means it's not surprising that it hasn't surpassed the existing image compression methods yet; however it clearly surpasses other compression methods based on neural networks. 
Areas of improvement; 
The process of training seems complex, with various stages involved and the need to freeze weights among other intricate elements. 
The reason for Figure 1 seems a bit unclear because its not obvious what the figure is trying to show.The discussion, about JPEG related effects might confuse readers since the paper mainly deals with a network structure instead of DCT quantization.
