This study presents a memory component tailored for extensive lifelong and instantaneous learning purposes in a way that is versatile enough to be seamlessly incorporated into various neural network structures while showcasing improved performance levels. 
The utilization of k neighbors for memory retrieval is not a completely novel concept and has previously been investigated in studies by Rae et al., 2016 and Chandar et al., 2016 as well as in [R1], for single shot learning purposes. However this research paper adds value by presenting data supporting the successful implementation of this method across various design frameworks. 
The authors have adequately answered all of my inquiries before the review process and I am content, with their replies. 
Would the authors consider sharing the source code to help others replicate their findings in the Omniglot experiments and synthetic task experiments?
