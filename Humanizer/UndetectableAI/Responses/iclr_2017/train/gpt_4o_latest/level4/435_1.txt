The approach focused on improving descent for image classification is clear and efficient. However initially it appeared suited for a workshop presentation rather than a full paper. The initial submission only showcased the algorithm on one task (the CIFAR dataset) without a theoretical foundation, which raised questions about its applicability, to other tasks. 
When working on neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) I've noticed that some findings in the research paper don't quite match up with what I've seen firsthand. In scenarios where different types of layers are combined (such as embedding layers with recurrent neural networks (RNN) convolutional neural networks (CNN) or gating mechanisms) I've found that ADAM type optimizers deliver much better results compared to simple stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum. The main reason behind this superiority is that ADAM removes the need for tuning of learning rates for each layer type. However in my practical experience using ADAM optimizers alongside Polyak averaging for more stable training performance is crucial since ADAM tends to show significant fluctuations, between batches. 
I've made the adjustments to ensure that the text appears more natural and human like. Here is the paraphrased version; 
The writers have greatly improved the study by conducting tests on datasets, than CIFAR. 
The recent study has reached a milestone in research progress; thus my previous categorization of it, as a workshop track paper is no longer accurate. 
After implementing these enhancements I have adjusted my rating accordingly.
