Thank you for sharing such a take, on highway and residual networks in your paper! It delves into an angle regarding the kinds of representations acquired at different layers in these models by integrating residual data periodically to uphold feature consistency and prevent the typical issue of feature degradation seen in convolutional neural networks. 
Advantages  
The process of unfolding step, by step seemed clear and easy to grasp with the help of understanding and sensible presumptions.   
Figure 3 clearly demonstrates the unrolling concept, with precision and clarity.   
Downsides  
Though the viewpoint is interesting and engagingly presented there lacks evidence to support the arguments thoroughly. The main studies primarily dealt with categorizing images and developing language models based on forms of character focused neural language models.   
Figures 4 and 5 should be. Enlarged to emphasize the significance of batch normalization more effectively.
