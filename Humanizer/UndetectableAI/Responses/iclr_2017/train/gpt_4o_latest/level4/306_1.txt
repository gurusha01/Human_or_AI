This study presents a learning approach using LSTM to grasp the optimization process of a different learning algorithm (specifically a neural network). 
The manuscript is crafted overall with a clear presentation of the main content. The key concept of comparing the Robbins Monro update rule to the LSTM update rule and using this comparison to meet the two needs of few shot learning (quick assimilation of new information and gradual extraction of transferable knowledge) is both intriguing and original. 
The writers use a mix of methods seen in work by Andrychowicz and colleagues from 2016 like parameter sharing and normalization while also introducing new design elements such as a unique approach to batch normalization, in their framework which is explained and applied thoughtfully throughout their study.  
The results of the experiment are compelling. Provide additional backing, for the arguments presented in the papers contentions.This submission is robust overall; nevertheless I have some reservations and queries; 
Is it possible that utilizing the loss function along with the gradient and parameters, for the meta learning process is repetition? Have you performed experiments to determine if using input combinations could be just as effective?  
It could be intriguing to investigate if other parts of the networks architecture, like the quantity and types of neurons could also be acquired through an approach. Do you have any ideas or observations regarding this scenario?  
The section discussing research, on meta learning seems a bit shallow as it touches upon well established concepts without delving deep into the specifics or exploring alternative methods that do not involve LSTMs explicitly. 
   Samuel Bengios doctoral dissertation from 1989 delves, into this subject matter. 
   In 1994s research by S.Bengio,Y.Bengio and J.Cloutier it was found that genetic programming was utilized to uncover learning rules, for neural networks. 
   I believe that JÃ¼rgen Schmidhubers work in this field has been valuable so it should be. Referenced to enhance the related research section. 
In summary I believe this paper makes a contribution. The concepts discussed are expected to appeal to a range of readers, at the International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR).
