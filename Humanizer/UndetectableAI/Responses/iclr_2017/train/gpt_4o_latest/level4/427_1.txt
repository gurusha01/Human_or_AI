The research paper presents a theoretical method for illustrating the key areas of the input feature map that greatly impact the final decision outcome.The core concept suggests that features causing changes in the output and are less easily predicted by other features are deemed crucial.In comparison to studies that mainly concentrated solelyon pinpointing features with maximal impacton the output this approach takes into account their predictability, from other features as well. The authors expand upon the ideas presented in the research, by Robnik Sikonja and Kononenko from 2008.
The findings indicate that the new way of presenting data by analyzing the conditional distribution highlights prominent areas than a method that focuses on the overall distribution would do so effectively. I like that the writers have included representations, for one image across various networks and categories. It really demonstrates how well the new approach captures distinctive features of different classes convincingly. Furthermore the writers have provided a link to illustrations for a selection of images, in a comment and I highly recommend them to incorporate this content into the papers appendix. 
One thing that bothers me about the paper is that Zeiler and others suggested a method for visualizing by fading out square areas of the imageâ€”this approach is quite similar in concept to creating visualizations using the marginal distribution method. In their study the authors generate the marginal visualizations, with 10 samples; yet if you were to increase the samples infinitely the image area would eventually turn gray. Conversely they use a distribution to model the conditional distribution bringing in some level of regularization. Therefore it might not be completely justified to estimate both the marginal distributions using just 10 samples each." I'd be interested in seeing how the proposed method based on the distribution compares with a visualization technique that utilizes grey image patches similar, to Zeiler et al.'ss approach.
