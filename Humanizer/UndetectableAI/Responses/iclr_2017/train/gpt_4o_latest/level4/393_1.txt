This article is excellently. Provides a straightforward and concise explanation.The starting point is to expand upon the attention mechanism framework by considering the attention variable \( z \). This variable is viewed as a distribution on both the input \( x \). Also the new method seamlessly integrates these variables as hidden elements, within models by leveraging a neural network to compute the potentials. 
From this point of view the study shows how standard relationships among variables (structures) can be explicitly represented within attention mechanisms. This enables the incorporation of graphical models like CRFs and semi Markov CRFs, into the attention mechanism to adequately grasp the dependencies that naturally exist in language structures. 
The results from the experiments confirm that the suggested model works well in scenarios like sequence to sequence tasks and tree based structures.It is clear that the experiments were thorough and meticulously conducted with attention to detail in the aspects such as standardizing the marginals, within the model. 
This study makes an addition, to the field and the suggested strategy could lead to progress in addressing other similar issues in research.
