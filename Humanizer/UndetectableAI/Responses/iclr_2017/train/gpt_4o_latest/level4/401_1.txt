The authors of this research suggest utilizing an introspection neural network to predict future weight values by analyzing their past trends directly. 
Strengths;   
The document is nicely. Simple to understand.   
The new meta learning method is innovative. Marks a shift from conventional approaches, to "learning how to learn."  
  
To enhance the reliability of the assessment further it should involve other types of neural network structures like fully connected and recurrent neural networks, with parameter space geometries that vary notably from CNN models.   
The specific information, about the architecture used in the MNIST and CIFAR experiments lacks sufficient explanation.   
The paper fails to mention the mini batch size employed in the experiments.   
It would be beneficial to include a comparison with baseline optimizers like Adam to enhance the studys credibility Alternatively Alternatively the authors may want to explain how they chose hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum, for the baseline SGD optimizer.   
In general;   
The limited details provided in the version of the paper pose a challenge, in reaching firm conclusions regarding the efficacy of the suggested approach.
