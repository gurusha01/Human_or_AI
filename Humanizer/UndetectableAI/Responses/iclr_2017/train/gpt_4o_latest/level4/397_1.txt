This study presents a model called the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which is created to filter out details to focus on understanding important overall patterns in the data.The method can be seen as a compression technique that sacrifices some information for efficiency; hence it is named Variational Loss Autocoder.To develop this model the researchers merge VAEs with autoregressive models creating a system that blends a hidden variable setup, with a durable recurrent structure. 
The authors start by introducing an explanation of VAE called Bits Back interpretation that clarifies the instances where the latent code is disregarded.Their findings align with research indicating that the autoregressive aspect of the model tends to encompass most of the datas structure while leaving the latent variables less utilized.To tackle this issue the authors suggest two approaches to prompt the decoder to make better use of the latent variables. The initial approach includes limiting the decoders scope to a small local area in order to require the latent code to handle distant connections effectively. The second method entails defining the distribution, for the latent code using an autoregressive model. 
The article also discusses the top performing outcomes achieved in the binarized MNIST dataset (including dynamic and static binarization) OMIGLOT dataset and Caltech 101 Silhouettes dataset. 
I enjoyed reading your review. It was insightful and well written.  
The Bits and Pieces explanation of VAE brings insights, to the research field.It not deepens comprehension but also highlights potential areas for enhancement as shown in this study. 
Having the skill to precisely manage the kind of data incorporated in the acquired representation holds promise for different uses like image retrieval tasks where these representations could facilitate finding objects, with similar shapes regardless of their textures. 
The authors suggest two enhancements to VAE. Introducing code via explicit information placement (Section 3. 1 ). Training the prior with autoregressive flow (Section 3. 2 ). However they did not analyze how a VAE with a PixelCNN decoder. Lacking an autoregressive flow (AF ) prior would fare. What effect would omitting the AF prior have, on the latent code ?
Furthermore​ it's still not clear if WindowAround(i​ ) only refers to a portion of x_{...}.
