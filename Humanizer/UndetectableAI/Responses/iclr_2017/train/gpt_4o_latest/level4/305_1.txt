I think this paper is the study I've come across so far in terms of using deep neural networks for image compression techniques.Its written well and the way they've included rate distortion theory in their objectives fits in smoothly with their overall framework.The authors also make a point to compare their method against a baseline (JPEG2000 instead of just JPEG like previous studies) which adds more credibility, to their assessment.I believe this paper is going to make an impression. 
It is important to mention the outcomes of benchmark pictures like Lena and Barbara and also compare them with the latest conventional techniques as I mentioned earlier in my queries. It is vital to explain the comparison between neural network based methods and traditional approaches to understand their relative strengths better, in the papers present state.
