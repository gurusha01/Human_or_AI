This article introduces an approach known as Incremental Network Quantization (INQ) which effectively transforms a pre trained high resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low resolution version without losing any important details or accuracy. The researchers argue that their technique can achieve low resolution quantization without sacrificing accuracy levelsâ€”a notable advancement compared to current methods that frequently result in visible reductions, in accuracy. 
The article delves into the challenge of transforming a pre trained high resolution CNN model into a lower resolution version without compromising accuracy efficiently.It's a thought out strategy as it deals with a significant problem in the realm of deep learning. The demand to utilize CNN models on devices with restricted computing capabilities and storage space.The authors conduct an analysis of current techniques and point out their shortcomings making a case, for the necessity of a fresh perspective. 
The research paper backs up its arguments with experiments conducted on the ImageNet large scale classification task utilizing different deep CNN models like AlexNet,VGG16, GoogleNet and ResNet architectures.The findings indicate that the suggested INQUIZ method is capable of attaining accuracy in comparison, to the standard full precision models even when using low precision weights like 5 bit 4 bit 3 bit and 2 bit ternary weights. The writers also show that their approach can be used alongside network trimming to achieve compression rates without compromising accuracy. 
After reviewing the findings and conducting a comprehensive assessment of the papers content and quality I have chosen to approve it for publication based primarily on the following key factors;

A study on how the INq method can be used for computer vision tasks, like detecting objects and segmenting images. 
I have some queries that I hope the authors can address to help me better grasp the content of the paper; 
Could the writers offer explanation on why they chose the variable length encoding method and its impact, on the effectiveness of the INO technique? 
How does the INQuiry method address situations where the pre trained high quality CNN model contains parameters and how does this impact the methods computational workload and memory needs? 
Are there any intentions to broaden the INW approach to include varieties of neural networks, like recurrent neural networks (RNNS) and long short term memory (LTSM)?
