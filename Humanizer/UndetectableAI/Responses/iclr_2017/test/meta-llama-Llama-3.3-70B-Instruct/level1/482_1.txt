The research paper aims to enhance informatics by creating a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that forecasts the medication categories a patient might be using based on a series of billing codes in their electronic health record (EHR). The authors suggest utilizing RNNs to capture the patterns in clinical data and testing their models effectiveness against various benchmarks such, as a feed forward neural network and a random forest algorithm. 
After reviewing the findings provided to me I have decided to approve this paper for publication.I have two reasons for this decision.Firstly the paper addresses an issue in the field of medical informatics by focusing on the accuracy of medication lists, in electronic health records.Secondly the authors introduce a method using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which has displayed encouraging outcomes when compared to standard models. 
The research paper effectively explains why the issue is important by examining existing literature on the challenges of maintaining medication records in detail. Additionally the authors describe their approach, in depth; outlining their RNN models structure and the metrics employed to gauge its effectiveness. The findings demonstrate that the RNN model surpasses models achieving a micro average AUC of 0 93 and a label ranking loss of 0 076. 
In order to make the paper even better I recommend that the authors delve deeper into explaining the implications of their findings especially how they could affect patient treatment and results. Moreover it would be beneficial to explore the mistakes made by the model, like which medications are frequently misidentified. The authors might also think about testing their model with a range of data to show how well it can apply to different situations. 
I have a couple of questions for the authors that I'd like them to address to help me better grasp the content of the paper; 1. How are the authors planning to tackle the challenge of label inaccuracies in the data that they have acknowledged as a limitation in their study?  2. Could the authors shed light on how understandable the RNN model is and highlight which features play a significant role, in predicting medication categories? How did the authors imagine incorporating their model into world medical practice and what challenges might hinder its acceptance?
