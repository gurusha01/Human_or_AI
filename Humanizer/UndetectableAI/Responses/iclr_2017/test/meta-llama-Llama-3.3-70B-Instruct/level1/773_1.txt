In brief
The study suggests utilizing Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) for biclustering analysis to examine datasets by grouping both rows and columns in a matrix simultaneously.The researchers argue that RFNs address the limitations of biclustering approaches like FABIA by creating sparse and non linear high dimensional models of the data efficiently.The research showcases numerical findings from simulated and actual datasets to highlight the enhanced effectiveness of RFNs, versus 13 other biclustering techniques. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and the authors compelling rationale supported by thorough experimental evidence provided in the manuscript summary; I have chosen to approve this submission for publication due to its innovative approach in addressing the shortcomings of current biclustering techniques through the implementation of RFNs (Random Forest Networks). The authors effectively. Articulate the drawbacks inherent, in existing methodologies while showcasing how RFNs offer solutions to mitigate these challenges. 
Arguments, in favor of the topic are provided.
The study thoroughly examines research on biclustering and effectively highlights the benefits of RFNs compared to current approaches in a clear manner.The testing outcomes are comprehensive and well thought out as they encompass synthetic and real life datasets.The researchers also offer an, in depth evaluation of the findings by incorporating assessments to prove the significance of the enhancements accomplished through RFNs. 
More Feedback. 
To make the paper better I think it would be good if the authors explain the results clearly especially in relation to the 1000 Genomes Project and also give more information about the computational resources needed for running the RFM algorithm as this could be important for practitioners to know about how to select the hyperparameters of the RFM algorithm because it may not be easy for those who are not experts, in this field. 
Queries, for the Writers.
To make sure I've got a grasp of the papers content. I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; 
Could you please elaborate further on how the RFNN algorithm's applied on GPUs and the specific enhancements that were implemented to ensure efficient processing? 
How do you determine the number of hidden units (clusters within clusters) and what impact does this parameter have on the outcomes, in the RFM technique? 
Could you elaborate further on how the findings from the 1000 Genomes Project're understood in terms of biology and their connection, to the theory of interbreeding between early human ancestors and other ancient hominins based on the identified IBD segments?
