The research paper suggests a series of design principles for neural network (CNN) structures with the goal of offering guidance to both experienced and inexperienced users in the field.Diving into studies on deep learning literature the authors identify common themes to outline 14 design principles like "Architectural Structure follows the Application" "Proliferate Paths" and "Strive for Simplicity". They also introduce network structures such, as Fractal of FractalNet Stagewise Boosting Networks and Taylor Series Networks while presenting experimental outcomes to support their design principles. 
Choice
After consideration of the paper in question *I have chosen to approve it for two main reasons;* *Firstly * the paper addresses an issue within the deep learning field. Offering valuable insights for constructing CNN architectures. *Secondly * the methodology presented is thoughtfully. Supported by an, in depth analysis of current literature. 
Reasons, for support.
The paper shows a grasp of the latest developments in deep learning research and highlights a noticeable gap in existing literature. Specifically the absence of guidelines for creating CNN architectures.The authorsâ€™ method of outlining design patterns is well reasoned and draws upon established principles from architecture and software design.The results of the experiments offer some support, for the validity of the suggested design patterns; however; a thorough assessment is required. 
Extra Comments 
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors delve deeper into analyzing the trade offs among design patterns and present more comprehensive experimental findings to support their assertions.It would also be beneficial to elaborate more on the uses and constraints of the suggested design patterns.Some queries I hope the authors could answer are as follows;(1)How do the suggested design patterns connect with established frameworks, like Residual Networks and Inception? Is it possible to use the design patterns in neural network models, like Recurrent Neural Networks or Deep Reinforcement Learning structures? How might these design patterns help enhance the clarity and understandability of CNN models?
