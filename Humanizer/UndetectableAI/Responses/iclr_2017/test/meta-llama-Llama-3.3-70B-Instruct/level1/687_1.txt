Overview of the Papers Contributions.
The research introduces a technique, for removing entire neurons from a trained neural network by using a second order Taylor series estimate of the error change when a neuron is eliminated. The authors compare this approach with a first order method and a force sequential removal method that systematically identifies the most optimal single neuron to remove at each step. The study also delves into exploring how neural networks learn representations, at their core level and presents findings supporting the idea of hidden units having a role. Some contribute to align with the output while others work towards neutralizing each others impact. 
Outcome decision is agreed upon. 
Sure thing! Here is the paraphrased text; "I chose to approve this paper because it addresses a question within the realm of neural networks; how to remove neurons from a trained network without compromising performance significantly? The method presented is compelling and supported by an evaluation compared to other pruning approaches, in the field of study."
