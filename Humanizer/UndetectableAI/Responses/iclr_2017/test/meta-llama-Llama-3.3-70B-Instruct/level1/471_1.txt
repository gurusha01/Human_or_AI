The study suggests a batch policy gradient technique (known as BPG) for training chatbots with neural network structures in reinforcement learning scenarios where rewards are uncertain and costly to acquire efficiently validated their approach through simulated trials and a real world test via Amazon Mechanical Turk involving a restaurant recommendations dataset focusing on enhancing chatbot responses using stochastic rewards, from human raters. 
Choice.
"I have chosen to approve this paper because the approach seems founded and the claims are backed up by actual results." 
Points, in Favor 
The research paper highlights the challenge posed by costly rewards in reinforcement learning for chatbots and presents a batch policy gradient technique to tackle this issue effectively.The authors conduct an examination of prior studies and illustrate the benefits of their approach compared to current methods.The practical outcomes on both real datasets indicate the efficacy of the suggested approach, in enhancing chatbot responses. 
Additional Input Needed 
To enhance the paper more effectively would be to recommend that the writers delve into greater depth regarding how they put into practice the GTD (λ) algorithm and why they chose specific hyperparameters to use it. Adding in real life examples of how the chatbot responds both before and after implementing the BPG method could provide a clearer picture of the enhancements made. It might also be beneficial for them to touch on any drawbacks of their method and suggest areas, for future research. 
Queries, for the Writers 
To make sure I grasp the paper correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; 
Could you please elaborate further on how the behavior policy's derived from the unlabeled data and its application, within the BPG algorithm? 
How do you decide on the hyperparameters like the step size and the return coefficient λ when using the BPG algorithm? 
Could you offer details on the pros and cons of using a fixed estimator versus the GTB (λ) based estimator, for the value function and how this decision impacts the effectiveness of the BPG technique?
