The research paper suggests a method for comprehending and enhancing the effectiveness of dropout. A commonly employed strategy for training deep neural networks. The writers present dropout as a close approximation of a hidden variable model that allows them to examine the difference, in inference during the training and inference stages of dropout. They bring in the notion of expectation dropout neural networks that help measure and manage this disparity in inference. The writers also suggest a method to manage the inference gap explicitly through a regularization scheme that can enhance the efficacy of dropout techniques.The document includes both explanations and practical outcomes to showcase the efficiency of the recommended strategy.
