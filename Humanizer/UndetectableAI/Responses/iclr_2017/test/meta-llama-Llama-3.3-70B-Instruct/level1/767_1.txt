Summary of the contributions made in the paper.
The article suggests a method for teaching machine learning algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This involves using actor critic techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). They introduce an approach where a policy network (actor) determines the learning rate during training and a value network (critic) evaluates the decisions effectiveness, at each stage. The studies show that the new approach helps SGD converge effectively and reduces overfitting to some degree while outperforminig competitors designed by humans to an extent. 
The primary factors influencing them.
After reviewing the paper I have chosen to accept it for two main reasons; 
The method is clearly backed by reasoning and is situated within the existing body of knowledge by tackling a crucial issue, in machine learning. The impact of learning rates on the sensitivity of SGD. 
The research paper presents real world data and theoretical support for the algorithms effectiveness through different experiments and comparisons, with other cutting edge techniques. 
Here are the reasons to back up my points.
The article offers an brief overview of the issue by discussing the significance of learning rates, in Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the drawbacks of current methods.The authors also conduct an examination of previous research findings while emphasizing the unique aspects of their method.The suggested algorithm is thoughtfully. The experiments are meticulously carried out to showcase its efficacy.The outcomes indicate that this new approach can outperform competitors designed by humans and mitigate overfitting to some degree.
