The article presents an educational setting called the Retro Learning Environment (RLE) which offers a uniform platform for different gaming consoles like Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis. RLE is crafted to be easily scalable for adding games and consoles and is supported by Python and Torch compatibility features. This setting presents hurdles to the latest cutting edge reinforcement learning algorithms involving aspects such, as 3D understanding, delayed rewards and distracting backgrounds. The authors show how well RLE works by training and testing algorithms on different SNES games and pointing out the importance of using more advanced algorithms to tackle the obstacles posed by RLE. 
Choice
"I have chosen to approve this paper because it presents an well supported learning setting that fills an important void in the realm of reinforcement learning.The paper offers an assessment of the setting and its obstacles while showcasing the promising prospects of RLE, for upcoming studies."
Arguments, in favor 
The article is nicely. Offers a concise summary of the RLE settings features and obstacles it presents.The writers exhibit a grasp of the relevant literature and present a detailed analysis in contrast to established environments like Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and OpenAI Gym.The trials held on RLE offer perspectives into the hurdles posed by the setting and underscore the necessity for more sophisticated algorithms.The article also delivers an brief conclusion encapsulating the key contributions and avenues, for future research. 
More feedback is needed.
To enhance the paper further. I recommend that the authors offer insights into how RLE was implemented by detailing the emulators utilized and explaining how new games and consoles were integrated into the system. It would also be beneficial if the authors conducted an analysis of the experimental outcomes by comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms across a range of SNES games. Furthermore incorporating more visual aids, like screenshots or videos to depict the difficulties associated with RLE and showcase the algorithms performance would be advantageous.
