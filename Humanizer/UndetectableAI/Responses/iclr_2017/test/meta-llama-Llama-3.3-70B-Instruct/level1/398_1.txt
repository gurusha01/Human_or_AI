In brief
The article presents a gated recurrent neural network named Chaos Free Network (CFM) which performs similarly to popular gated structures like LSTMs and GRUs, in word level language modeling tasks.The writers demonstrate that the CFM displays predictable dynamics without chaotic tendencies seen in other common gated architectures. 
Choice
"I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because it addresses a unique and intriguing query regarding the behavior of RNN models and secondly because the method is well grounded and backed by both theoretical and practical evidence."
Reasons to Back Up Your Points
The paper offers an succinct overview of the issue of chaos in RNNs and highlights the importance of having a basic and understandable model, in place.The authors suggest an uncomplicated gated RNN structure called CFNa nd delve into its dynamics through analysis to reveal its nonchaotic nature and straightforward attractor properties.Additionally the paper showcases outcomes in word level language modeling task demonstrating that CFNs performance rivals that of LSTMs and GRUs. 
**More Input Required, for Enhancement** 
To enhance the papers quality I recommend the authors delve deeper into comparing the dynamics and performance of RNN architectures like vanilla RNNs and GRUs. It would also be intriguing to explore experiments on various tasks such, as character level language modeling or machine translation to showcase the CFNs effectiveness further. 
Queries, for the Writers 
To make sure I've got a grasp of the papers content I'd like to pose these questions to the authors; 
Could you explain further why the CFNs can perform well as LSTMs and GRUs even though they have simpler dynamics? 
How do you intend to expand the CFNN to account for longer term relationships and what drawbacks do you see in the design? 
Could you please elaborate further on the method of initializing the CFNs and LSTMs. How it impacts the effectiveness of the models?
