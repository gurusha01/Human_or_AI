My decision is to approve this paper because the approach is well founded and fits within the existing literature context.The authors have effectively outlined the background and notation while presenting convincing results that highlight the advantages of incorporating eligibility traces and Adam as the optimizer. 
Reasons to back up your point.
The study addresses an issue in the realm of reinforcement learning. Focusing on the integration of eligibility traces with recurrent networks to enhance learning outcomes in scenarios with limited rewards.The methodology is justified effectively by outlining the advantages of incorporating eligibility traces and their potential to enhance learning in situations where rewardsre infrequent.The empirical findings are robustly substantiated with an examination of the outcomes and a discussion, on the significance of the discoveries. 
More Feedback Here. 
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the writers delve into the specifics of how they tuned hyperparameters and offer an examination of the outcomes. It would also be engaging to see them conduct trials on various Atari games to showcase how broadly applicable their method is. Moreover a thorough discussion on the constraints of their approach and its adaptability, to more intricate settings would be valuable. 
Queries, for the Writers.
Could I kindly request the authors to provide some clarification on the following aspects? 
How did the authors decide on using Î»=0..80 for the eligibility traces and how much do the results change based on this parameters adjustment? 
Could the writers elaborate further on how they implemented the Adam optimizer and fine tuned it for the experiments? 
What strategies do the writers intend to use to deal with the problem of the networks update frequency and how might this impact their approach?
