The research introduces a method for recommending systems named Collaborative Deep Embedding (CDE). This method utilizes neural networks to comprehend intricate connections between users and items effectively.The CDE model involves a pair of networks. One for encoding items and the other for users. That are trained together in a collaborative manner to enhance recommendations.This approach tackles issues present in conventional recommender systems such, as the cold start problem and the limited ability to capture diverse user item interactions. The writers showcase how well CDE works on three datasets and highlight notable enhancements compared to the best existing methods.
