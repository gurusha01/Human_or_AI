Summary 
The document introduces an optimization technique for Piecewise Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL CNNs) which are a type of convolutional neural networks using piecewise linear activation functions like ReLU and max pooling and an SVM classifier, as the last layer. The method treats the parameter estimation of each layer as a difference of concave (DC) problem that can be resolved through the convex procedure (CCP). The CCCP algorithm shows a reduction in the learning goal with each round of iteration and can determine the best step size through analytical computation methods.The research showcases how well the algorithm performs across standard datasets like MNIST,CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 highlighting its superiority, over advanced versions of backpropagation algorithms currently available.
