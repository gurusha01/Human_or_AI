The research introduces a method for training stochastic neural networks to draw samples from specific target distributions by using Amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (ASVGD). This technique involves tweaking the network parameters gradually to reduce the difference between the models distribution and the desired one (KL divergence). The researchers further utilize this approach to train energy models and create SteinGAN—a generative adversarial network capable of generating high quality images comparable, to cutting edge outcomes in the field.
