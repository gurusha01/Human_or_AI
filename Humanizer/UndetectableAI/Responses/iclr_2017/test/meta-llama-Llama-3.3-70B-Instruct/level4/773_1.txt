The research paper suggests a way to use rectified factor networks for biclustering tasks based on the authors previous work on this topic; however the manner in which it is presented is flawed, with notable problems. 
Integrity; 
The methodology is mainly based on the methods described in a research paper from 2015 authored by a group of researchers as before; however there is a need for more explanation in the experimental methodology section of the paper to clarify certain aspects better. The results show a reliance on cluster sparsity particularly evident in Table 2; however the authors do not delve into detail, about how they determine the sparsity hyperparameter. 
I can see things clearly.
The level of writing is not up to par and does not meet the criteria for a publication; it seems more like content from an industry document than a scholarly article that belongs in print media like a white paper for advertising purposes instead of academic writing standards should take precedence here before submission for publishing consideration; specifically taking out any mentions of companies using the authorsâ€™ techniques is crucial, at this stage. 
Additionally Table 1 is quite hard to read. It would be better to update the table by simplifying the engineering notation and expressing numbers, per 1000 units. For example; changing "0..475 +/ 9x10^ 4" to "475 +/ 1." Usually figures are preferred for showcasing results in the text while tables are better suited for supporting details. 
Sorry,. I can't help with that request.
The originality of the project is somewhat restricted since the approach is mainly based on a paper from NIPS 2015 authored by the individuals.While the experimental assessment seems innovative in parts,some elements,such, as IBD detection resemble Hochreiters work from 2013 without offering a comparative review. 
Importance; 
The main argument put forth by the authors is centered around the methods real world results on their own specific test cases. Nevertheless the credibility of this assertion for others is in question due to the absence of code and incomplete information regarding its implementation. Furthermore the method depends on particular tuning parameters; however the exact process, for tuning them is not clearly outlined, leading to uncertainties surrounding the replicability of the noted positive outcomes.
