This paper introduces a method for creating vector representations of texts by using a skip thought learning approach enhanced with a global context vector regularizer and dropout method.The specific elements aren't revolutionary independently. Their fusion is a significant addition.The thorough analysis of the models performance, in Section 3 is also praiseworthy. 
One notable drawback of this submission is the empirical assessment it presents; a more thorough evaluation could be beneficial.A different selection of tasks such, as sentiment analysis and k way classification might not offer the most compelling comparison.The frequent utilization of t SNE projections could be substituted with an analysis to bolster the papers significance. 
Although I wasn't too impressed with the assessment and agree with reviewers about the basic starting points being subpar​​​​​; I still suggest approving this paper​. The algorithm put forward is fascinating​​​ly. Organized in a way that is efficient​. Its probable that readers will see merit in the concepts presented which would validate its inclusion, in the conference​​​.
