This document outlines a series of recommendations for creating neural network (CNN) structures for image processing and computer vision assignments and serves as a summary of current CNN structures available today. Moreover it puts forth some architectural ideas influenced by these recommendations that have been tested out through experiments using the CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets. Nevertheless the effectiveness of these structures seems to be somewhat lacking based on the outcomes shown in Table 1 which raises doubts, about their utility. 
The issue at hand is whether putting together these guidelines. Mostly drawn from prior studies. Justifies being published as a brand research paper or not. Although condensing insights in the realm of CNNs. Now a key element in computer vision. Could prove helpful particularly for beginners; a substantial part of the material appears to lean on common sense notions (such as points 1, 3 7 11). The rest might be better suited for resources or blog entries tailored towards familiarizing individuals, with CNN training concepts. Moreover the paper appears to lean more towards developments and incremental progressions, in the field like the various versions of ResNet. 
The paper suggests that there is a misconception about the universality of CNN behaviors when it comes to downsampling activations and increasing channel numbers from the initial to layer—an issue that has been previously addressed in connection, with design pattern 5. The explanation given (“the nature of design patterns is that they only apply some of the time”) does not adequately support sweeping claims. It may be appropriate to reconsider this assertion and potentially retract it based on these considerations. 
The explanation given about how normalization improves the efficiency of backpropagation by treating all input samples section 3 point 2 second paragraph) seems unclear and can be understood in various ways.It would be helpful to provide details and back it up with experimental proof rather, than personal views expressed through "we feel." The paper contains instances of ambiguous statements lacking empirical support. 
The suggested link, between Taylor series and the alleged Taylor Series Networks seems tenuous. The labeling appears unsuitable The resultant function is a combination of assorted functions elevated to diverse exponents; it does not form a polynomial and embodies a general nonlinear function of x that lacks specific appeal or originality. 
Overall the paper seems to present a jumble of ideas and thoughts, without organization and the experimental results fall short in terms of persuasiveness of validation. The amalgamation of existing knowledge and the introduction of ideas lack the thoroughness and precision typically seen in a research paper which indicates that further refinement may be needed before considering publication.
