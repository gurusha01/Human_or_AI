This document utilizes the pointer network structure that employs an attention system to concentrate on parts of the input sequence in order for the decoder to produce these parts as results and address simple combinatorial optimization challenges like the well known traveling salesman problem. The model is taught using reinforcement learning techniques with a focus on an actor critic strategy where the actor is trained using the REINFORCE method and the critic estimates the reward baseline, within the REINFORCE goal. 
The article is nicely. Easy to follow as it introduces a fresh use of reinforcement learning and attention models to understand the characteristics of spaces where different sized combinatorial problems can be solved efficiently.There is a prospect in exploring new ways to tackle traditional neural based approaches for combinatorial optimization problems by applying modern sequence to sequence techniques to them.This makes it a compelling option for consideration, at conferences. 
However I do have a number of thoughts and important issues, about the manuscript.
I don't agree with what the authorsre saying about how the pointer network method can work for all types of combinatorial optimization problems. Real life combinatorial problems are tricky because of their constraints that determine possible solutions like time limits or having multiple salespeople, in TSP variations. For these types of problems it's not so simple to rule out solutions by ignoring instances that were visited before; sometimes finding even one workable solution can be really tough. I think it's important to explore if the suggested Neural Combinatorial Optimization method can handle these issue categories effectively and how it can be upscaled if necessary. In my view; the approach outlined seems suited for assignment tasks, with straightforward constraint setups. 
The field of operations research includes standard problems used for comparison purposes like the ones available, in TSPLIB that have multiple instances of Travel Salesman Problem (TSP). It would be helpful to use these problems in the assessment to showcase how well the proposed method works compared to others and how competitive it is.The authors should also think about comparing their outcomes with performing solvers to give a better insight into how well their method performs and where its strengths and weaknesses lie.  
Additional remarks and concerns might involve conversations regarding how the model can be expanded in scope and size and how easily the results can be understood and interpreted along with potential directions, for further study while keeping the technical details and format of the initial review unchanged.
