The changes made to this document are thorough. Have successfully tackled most of the issues I had initially raised. Making the paper more readable overall. Therefore I highly suggest accepting this revised version and have consequently rated it higher in my evaluation. 
In this papers introduction a new method is presented for understanding Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) a type of model known for its complexity in interpretation.It focuses ontackling the challenge of interpreting LSTM predictions in question and answer scenarios by breaking them down into importance ratings, for each word.This technique involves using these ratings to create patterns that can be used to uncover answers through a matching process. When using the WikiMovies dataset for analysis using this method of pattern matching we just discussed achieves accuracy levels as a standard LSTM model does indicate how effective this approach can be, in practice. 
The reason, behind this study is quite interesting since understanding LSTMs continues to pose a challenge that is not easily resolved yet The impressive results obtained through the pattern matching method stand out and may even come as somewhat unexpected Still there are some parts of the pattern identification process that could use explanations and the assessment only focuses on a particular task where predictions are made at the word level. Thus in its state I suggest accepting this manuscript with reservations. I encourage the authors to elaborate on their methodology to benefit researchers, in the field of Natural Language Processing (NAL).
I appreciate your feedback.
Before diving into Section 6 of the document review process guide to evaluate models for QA tasks in depth it might be helpful to offer a thorough introduction specifically outlining the types of QA tasks these models are used for. One key aspect that could be clarified early is the tasks essence—such as pinpointing an entity within a document as the answer—which isn't entirely evident, at this stage. 
In Section 4 can you explain if the softmax function is trying to predict a simple yes or no value ( 2 / not ) to show whether a specific word is the answer or not ?
Sure thing! Can you provide details about the P and Q vectors in Section 3 of your document, for better understanding? 
How does the pattern matching methods effectiveness change, with varying cutoff values? 
In Section 5 point 3; Are there any queries that don't relate to entities?"
Can we talk about how we could expand the suggested method to situations where forecasts aren't made for each word. Like when dealing with classifying sentiment at the sentence level?
