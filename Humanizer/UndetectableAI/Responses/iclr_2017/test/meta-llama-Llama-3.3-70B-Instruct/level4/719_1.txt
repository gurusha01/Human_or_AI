This research introduces a method, for teaching neural networks without using direct labels; it relies on whether example pairs are linked or not linked instead. 
The paper could use presentation and improved writing for easier understanding There are some design choices that need better justification, like using the power function in the distribution approximations E step (section 2. 10 ) And focusing solelyon a uniform distribution. While using a prior might go against the assumption of no prior class knowledge it's not clear how practical scenarios would actually benefit from the suggested configuration. 
Moreover the idea is similar to co training techniques in semi supervised learning that have been widely studied. To ensure this submission is appropriate, for the conference it's crucial to tackle these issues offer detailed explanations and show how the suggested approach can be practically applied.
