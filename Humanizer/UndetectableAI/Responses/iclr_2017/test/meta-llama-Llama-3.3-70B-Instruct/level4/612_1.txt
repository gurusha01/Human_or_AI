This paper introduces an approach to forecasting future frames by altering the preceding frame instead of directly forecasting individual pixels. However this idea has been previously examined in studies. The authors argue that current techniques are predictable, in nature; nevertheless their suggested model overlooks the concept of possibilities.  
In my feedbacks I recommended assessing their approach by utilizing two RGB frames as input to anticipate the transformation as an outcome. This would enable a quantitative evaluation of the advantages of incorporating transformations as both input and output factors which is quite significant given that this study marks the inaugural use of transformations as input data points; regrettably though the authors misunderstood this proposal and argued that using RGB frames to predict forthcoming frames would yield fuzzy results. Contrary, to what was initially intended with the suggestion. The uniqueness of this contribution in comparison, to works is still uncertain and unconfirmed.
