The writers of this paper explore whether chaotic behavior is essential in RNN models to excel in tasks by introducing a chaos free design to validate this theory successfully based on the conducted experiments that confirm chaos is not a mandatory element, for performance.  
This piece stands out for its perspective since it starts with a clear hypothesis and thoroughly evaluates it; this could set the stage for shaping future RNN design principles.  
One drawback of the research is that the tests are focused mainly on tasks that don't require complex dynamic systems so it would be helpful for the researchers to investigate a wider variety of datasets to pinpoint situations where unpredictability is truly crucial.
