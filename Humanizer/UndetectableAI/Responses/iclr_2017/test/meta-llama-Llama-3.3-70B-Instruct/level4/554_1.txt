This paper combines Deep Recurrent Q Networks (DRQN) with eligibility traces while exploring the use of the Adam optimizer for optimizing q networks in a research study setting.The rationale behind this approach is sound and the results from experiments highlight the benefits of incorporating eligibility traces and the Adam optimizer in playing two Atari games.Although the methods used're not groundbreaking the significant contributions of this study are (1)moving forward with incorporating eligibility traces and the Adam optimizer into DRQN and (2)a thorough evaluation, through experiments. The paper is organized effectively and easy to understand in how its presented. 
The results from the experiments give us a number based analysis. Provide in depth qualitative perspectives on how well the methods work and their effectiveness is highlighted in the process. However; due to the focus of the results, on just two Atari games; it becomes difficult to determine how broadly applicable this approach is. Expanding the scope of the results to cover games or different areas would greatly improve the overall quality of the manuscript. Additionally; including error margins based on random starting points would also enhance the overall credibility of the paper.
