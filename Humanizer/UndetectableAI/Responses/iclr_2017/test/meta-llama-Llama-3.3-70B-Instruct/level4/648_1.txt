This document presents a method that combines supervised and unsupervised learning to improve convolutional neural networks performance in a more regulated manner. The writers propose a framework for image completion where the discriminator is trained to distinguish between images from the original dataset and those produced by the model while also learning to identify objects in images from the original dataset. The results of experiments show that this approach is effective as the features learned by the discriminator achieve object recognition results that're on par with or even better than the current leading results, on two datasets. In the end the suggested idea seems to be a efficient approach, to standardizing CNN models resulting in improved classification accuracy.
