This written work introduces a type of recurrent neural network that has two distinct temporal dimensions and can serve as a decoder to create tree structures within an encoder decoder system framework. The suggested design is well supported. Could have wider uses beyond the ones mentioned in the document especially in situations where tree structures must be created from disorganized data. 
The papers notable drawback is its experimental evaluation scope; while the IFTTT dataset and synthetic dataset are a good starting point incorporating more tasks related to natural language processing with syntactic tree structures could enhance its value. Nonetheless the current experiments serve as an initial move, in showcasing the potential of this novel architecture. 
The papers notable strength lies in how the authors examine different design options for the topology predictor element and the thought process behind deciding when to terminate it.This, in depth analysis offers a comprehensive insight into the performance of the architecture instead of being based on just one random design choice. 
I suggest considering this manuscript for the conference as it shows promise for research and has potential, for further development and application.
