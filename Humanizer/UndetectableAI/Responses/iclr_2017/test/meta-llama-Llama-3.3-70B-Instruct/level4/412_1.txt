This paper presents a method for optimizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by layer that uses piecewise linear non linearities in a unique way. The process involves training CNNs with piecewise linear functions one layer at a time by simplifying the problem into a latent structured Support Vector Machine (SVM) which's a well known concept in the field. Additionally the paper improves upon the BCFW algorithm used in the procedure. Overall the paper introduces an idea though the results, from the experiments lack persuasion. 
Advantages; 
The new approach seems original. The authors have conducted a detailed theoretical examination based on what I know. 
The report is nicely. Lucidly written for easy understanding. 
Areas, for improvement; 
While the method could be used for structured prediction issues, in general terms the tests only focuson a simple multi classification job which reduces the significance of this research. 
  
The accuracy of the test results, for the CIFAR. 10 Dataset appears doubtful as the performing model achieved an accuracy of 70. 20 %, A lower figure compared to the commonly cited accuracy rates exceeding 90 % in previous research studies. This outcome brings up doubts regarding the reliability of the findings.
