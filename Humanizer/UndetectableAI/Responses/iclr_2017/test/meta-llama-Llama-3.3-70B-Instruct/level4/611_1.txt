The writers propose using a neural network to understand user and item embeddings for recommending items to users but their method is quite similar to the already existing CDl approach which also uses neural networks for recommendations albeit with some minor differences. Moreover the evaluation of their experiments is limited because the suggested DualNETS method utilizes item characteristics for comparison, with WMf and CDl leading to biased results.
