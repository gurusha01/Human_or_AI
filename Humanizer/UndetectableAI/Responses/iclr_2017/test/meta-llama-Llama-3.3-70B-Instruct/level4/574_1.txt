This study introduces a visual search system that aims to find product images using specific fashion items as reference points.It offers an exploration of the difficulties encountered in this particular field.The strategy discussed in the study adeptly addresses obstacles and reflects a deep understanding of the intricate nature of the task, at hand. 
Several important matters need attention; 
One important issue is that there is no mention or acknowledgment of the research conducted by Tamara Bergs team on fashion recognition and characteristics. They have published works like "Automatic Attribute Discovery and Characterization from Noisy Web Data" in ECCV 2010 "Where to Buy It; Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops‚Äù, in ICCV 2015 and "Retrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing" in TPAMI 2014.To fully grasp the uniqueness and impact of the suggested method requires an examination and contrast, with existing literature. 
The paper doesn't provide specifics about the attribute dataset; where it came from and if the images are clean product pictures or real world images; the annotation process; and the instructions given to annotators in detail is missing crucial information to truly grasp the papers contributions and enable comparisons with future studies effectively. Although some statistical details may be confidential, for reasons including proprietary nature of the dataset; revealing these specifics is vital for the scientific community to replicate and further develop this research. 
Adding baseline comparisons would improve the research papers overall quality and credibility. For example;. Contrasting the outcomes in Table 2 with complex approaches, like BM or CM methods referenced in the content would offer a more thorough assessment of how well the new system performs. 
Ultimately the paper provides a captivating investigation into search, within the fashion realm; however it is crucial to address these issues to ensure the credibility and publication readiness of the study.
