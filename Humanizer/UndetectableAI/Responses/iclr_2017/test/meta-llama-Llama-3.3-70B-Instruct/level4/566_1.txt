This research paper introduces a method for learning that selects mini batches from a pool using deep learning and an estimated Bayesian posterior distribution The approach involves making various approximations, for important terms. 
The suggested approach of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation in reasoning, for active learning poses an interesting but daunting task to grasp because of its intricate nature. 
The writing suffers from English at times and this can make it a bit challenging to read smoothly. 
Though the alternative active learning strategies could be presented succinctly in the papers description section the authors should delve into a more elaborate and organized explanation of their proposed method given its many intricate approximations. Furthermore introducing an additional dataset would enhance the research as the existing datasets such, as gray digits and USPS exhibit similarities and may not completely showcase the methodologys flexibility.
