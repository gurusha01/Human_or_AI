This paper introduces a hierarchical generative model that emphasizes analyzing individual data points in datasets at the lower level and capturing unordered sets of datasets at the higher level.The main idea centers on using a "variational bound where a latent variable, at the higher level represents datasets and another latent variable at the lower level characterizes specific examples within those datasets. 
Hierarchical modeling is an influential area of study that has not received much attention within the deep learning community. 
The positive aspects of this document are; 
The results of few shot learning show success but require a more, in depth understanding of this particular field for a comprehensive assessment. 
The clear explanation of incorporating a "variational bound within a hierarchical generative model showcases its wide range of practical uses. 
There are a things to consider based on the presentation. 
Do they use minibatches (which're subsets of examples during training the statistical network)?
Would using minibatches lead to an assessment of the complete gradient when all instances are taken into account? For example; If the networks goal is to detect a common feature in any instance in the dataset and use it as a representation. This seems consistent with the diagram on the right side of figure 1.However teaching the statistical network, on minibatches could restrict its capacity to understand these representations because each minibatch might not contain all instances from the dataset. This method might limit the models ability to fully express itself. 
Some areas worth exploring could be; 
When using this kind of model, for forecasting tasks like estimating electricity consumption or sales predictions. It presents an interesting and practical application scenario.
