This study introduces an coherent method, for predicting and categorizing graph nodes using a basic algorithm.The concepts are easy to grasp and lead to a training process based CNN that can take advantage of GPU acceleration features already available. 
The thorough assessment conducted covers comparisons with many appropriate reference points using extensive real world benchmark datasets. Although my knowledge of methods in the field is somewhat limited and recognizing that predicting links and nodes has been a persistent challenge with potentially comparable solutions over time I perceive the suggested strategy, as relatively straightforward and well supported by the findings of the experiments.
