The writers present a method for calculating polynomial characteristics on sparse matrices in a more efficient manner by connecting matrices to their polynomial versions smartly to create a powerful Compressed Sparse Row (CSR). They back up their evaluation of time complexity with evidence, from experiments. 
The proposed algorithm seems interesting and well presented with possible uses; however the testing and exploration of its applications lack depth to some extent. Additionally the alignment, between this study and the core theme of ICLR is not evident away and it might be more suitable to consider submitting it to a more appropriate platform.
