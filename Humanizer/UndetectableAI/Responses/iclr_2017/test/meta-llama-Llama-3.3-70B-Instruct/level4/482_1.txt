This article is nicely. Easy to follow with interesting content that keeps the reader engaged throughout the reading process The authors should be commended for their storytelling and detailed explanations Even though it doesn't present groundbreaking methods or new architectural concepts it focuses on an important task which is predicting patient medication patterns using billing code data The dataset used is impressive both, in its size and its relevance exceeding the usual basic datasets often seen in machine learning studies The authors could enhance the thoroughness of their analysis in line with expectations for application driven papers. A common practice in academic writing fields of study like this one. It's worth acknowledging the authors integration of cutting edge tools like Keras and Adadelta into their framework despite the emphasis being, on application related aspects. There are an aspects that call for critical evaluation; 
The way the numbers are shown seems a bit short. To the point in the presentation of results.While Figures 4 and 5 show outcomes. With Figure 5 mostly showing negative findings (since tSNE can only be interpreted in specific situations). Table 1 stands out as the main source of actual evidence presented in the study.Because there is a reliance on just one dataset here the depth of analysis and empirical proof provided may not be as thorough as expected for a paper that doesn't introduce any significant new algorithms or theories.Although not a major issue this particular aspect feels somewhat lacking, in detail. 
In a manner concerning the outcomes presented here; it would be advantageous to swap out Figure 5 with a more detailed evaluation of performance metrics. Figure 5 doesn't offer valuable information apart from showing a negative outcome that could be explained concisely without having a dedicated figure, for it. 
The paper uses words and assumes a certain level of knowledge that might not be familiar to everyone at the ICLR conference audience mentioned by another reviewer who proposed that a medical or healthcare event could be a better fit for this research work. While I understand and respect that viewpoint about the conference venue suggestion issue raised by the reviewer; I personally feel that the machine learning community gains valuable insights from detailed and well thought out applications, like this one. Of relocating the presentation to a different venue as suggested by the reviewer; it would be more beneficial to simplify the complex technical terms and present the findings in a way that is easier for an ICLR attendee to understand and evaluate. Researchers who lack a background are often limited to taking the results presented after Table 1 at face value instead of being able to utilize their quantitative analysis skills on them. 
In terms the paper is well done.
