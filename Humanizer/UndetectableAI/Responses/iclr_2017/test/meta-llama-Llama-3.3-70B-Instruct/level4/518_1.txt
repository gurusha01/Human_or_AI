This paper introduces a modified version of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) where a neural network is created to mimic the SVG dynamics and implements this technique in adversarial training to develop a training method that views the discriminator as a probabilistic model based on energy levels. 
In my view the presentation is a bit off because it puts a lot of focus on laying the groundwork for a method that is supposed to be widely applicable. Then only tests it out in one particular situation.. The paper doesn't convincingly show how broadly the proposed method can be applied or it doesn't spend enough time assessing SteinGAN since it invested so much effort, in setting up the basis. 
The evidence presented is not enough to support the suggested method according to the findings of one reviewer who mentions that DCGAN is now considered an outdated standard for comparison purposes in this context. Upon examination of the results provided qualitatively speaking SteinGAN samples do not show significant enhancements compared to DCGAN samples except for those from the CelebA dataset where there seems to be some discrepancy, with the original DCGAN paper samples. 
Quantitatively speaking DCGAN slightly edges out SteinGAN in the ImageNet Inception Score department but falls behind by a margin in the CIFAR10 Inception Score category. Additionally I personally don't find the "testing accuracy" metric very convincing as an evaluation method since it only focuses on information pertinent to the discrimination task instead of considering the larger modeling task, at hand. This metric may not adequately capture details found in the background of an image.
