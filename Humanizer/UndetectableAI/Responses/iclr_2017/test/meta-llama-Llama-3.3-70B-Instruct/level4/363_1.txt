This article introduces a framework that compares and combines information for tasks, in natural language processing that analyze the meaning of text sequences like question answering and textual entailment.  
The fundamental structure of the model includes using a neural network to combine information and then comparing the attentive results, from LSTMs through element wise operations.  
One significant aspect of this study is its examination of different techniques, for comparing text sequences; the use of element wise subtraction and multiplication operations resulted in better outcomes across four diverse datasets.  
Yet one drawback of this research lies in its approach and somewhat limited originality level. A thorough qualitative evaluation exploring the effectiveness of comparison methods such as subtraction and multiplication, on a range of sentence varieties could yield more enlightening results.
