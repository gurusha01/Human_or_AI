This research introduces a effective starting point for creating textures based on parameters by showing that textures produced using various scales and random filters sometimes perform as well as the VGG based model that uses pre trained filters, across multiple layers.The authors suggest that creating textures may not always require hierarchical structures or learned characteristics from maps.  
The research is definitely fascinating. Offers valuable perspectives to consider.However more verification of the findings is needed, in terms of deep layered representations.Its worth mentioning that the outcomes generated by both VGG and single layer models show flaws and don't reach the same level of quality, as non parametric methods.Furthermore the VGG based model seems to excel in the inpainting assignment as depicted in Figure 7. Furthermore it would be valuable to explore if a hierarchical framework could better manage scale processing instead of depending on multiple filters of different sizes.
