The writers suggest a method to adjust the step size in SGD by treating the learning rate as a move in an MDP game where the prize is linked to the loss functions alteration This technique is compared with popular adaptive optimization methods for training deep neural networks, like Adagrad and Adam Although the findings are interesting it's tough to compare them Here are some key points I noticed; 
What is the computational expense of the actor critic algorithm in contrast to optimization techniques mentioned in the paper without providing visual representations depicting the time taken for optimization processes even though the effectiveness of approaches, like Adagrad mainly relies on their time efficiency instead of the number of iterations performed. 
Why does the system only learn a learning rate instead of training separate RL models, for each parameter like other first order methods do to adaptively adjust the learning rate individually for each parameter and ensure a fair comparison? 
Considering that learning naturally involves change and evolution as opposed to the static nature assumed by reinforcement learning algorithms when it comes to the environments stability; what supports the belief that a reinforcement learning algorithm can effectively determine a suitable pace, for learning? 
How does the new method in Figure 6 stack up against approaches such as stopping in terms of performance effectiveness and generalization capability? One potential explanation could be that the actor critic technique seems to exhibit generalization due, to its potentially less efficient optimization process leading to reduced overfitting.
