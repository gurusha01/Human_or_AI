This study presents an approach to optimize the stochastic gradient descent (SGDM) specifically for scenarios where gradients are calculated using linear operations like least squares linear regression and polynomial regression problems.This method aims to match the effectiveness of SGDM by using a suggested reliable combiner.To improve the performance of this combiner the authors introduce a projection matrix for reducing dimensions.Experimental findings indicate that this new method outperforms existing techniques such, as Hogwild!. Allreduce in terms of acceleration. 
I think there might be a confusion, about the computational difficulty of SGD. 
The matrix M created in the method suggested might end up being pretty big and demanding in terms of computation power.SGD updates the weight vector w sequentially. Needs O(f) time and space where f represents the number of features.On the hand M is an f × f matrix resulting in a time and space complexity of O(f²) for SGD.In practice this would require O(f) processors to achieve consistent speedups which isn't practical, for datasets containing thousands or millions of features. 
The assertion that updating Mi * v demands O(f² ) space and time complexity is not accurate in my view when v is a dimensional vector. Considering Mi as a rank matrix in the format ( I. Ai ai’ ) the complexity and space needs can be minimized to O(f ) by computation such, as O(v. Ai (ai' v )). When M_i is represented as the outcome of n rank one matrices multiplication process can result in a complexity and space demand of O(fn ).In this papers context n must be considerably less than f for the validity of the authors’ assumptions and strategies to be in question due, to their misunderstanding of SGDs space and time complexity. 
Moreover the reason, behind the speedup achieved by the proposed method remains unclear in the paper as it fails to outline which calculations are executed simultaneously or why the sequential algorithm would result in a speedup when M_i * v is computed most efficiently. 
To enhance the precision and academic depth of this papers content I suggest implementing the following adjustments; 
Could you please offer an analysis of the computational complexity, for each stage of the suggested algorithm?
Make sure to analyze the convergence rate alongside the convergence analysis to assess how reducing dimensionality affects complexity.
