The paper introduces an well supported method, for predicting/classifying graph nodes.The suggested approaches are easy to understand and lead to a CNN oriented training structure that can make good use of current GPU enhancements. 
The thorough assessment in the study includes a comparison of the method with well known benchmarks using extensive real world datasets. Although I may not have an, in depth knowledge of methods discussed in the literature since predicting links and nodes has been a long standing issue there could be similar strategies out there. Nonetheless I consider the suggested approach to be straightforward and well supported by empirical evidence.
