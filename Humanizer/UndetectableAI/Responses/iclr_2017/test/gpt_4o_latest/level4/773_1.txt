The research paper discusses the use of rectified factor networks for biclustering task as proposed by the authors before. Faces challenges, in its presentation despite showing promise. 
Lets start with the quality of the product.
The suggested method is mainly based on methods outlined in a NIPS 2015 article written by the same researchers involved here. There is a need, for explanation regarding the experimental process used. In attention should be given to the results. Especially those presented in Table 2. Which seem to heavily rely on how sparse the identified clusters are. Nonetheless the authors do not give specifics on how they choose the sparsity hyperparameter. 
Could you please provide context or details, about the specific elements you need clarity on?
The writing in question presents issues and does not meet the required standards for a scientific publication.It resembles more of a material from the industry rather than an unbiased scientific study.A thorough revision is essential before the paper can be reviewed for publication.Precisely every reference, to companies utilizing the suggested methods should be excluded. 
Furthermore Table 1 is very hard to read all. A better way to show it would be as a picture or by making it much clearer by getting rid of technical notation and showing values per 1000. For example "0,475 ± 9 x 10^ 4'' could be changed to ''475 ± 0,09''. Overall it's best to use figures for showing results, in the body of text while keeping tables for additional information. 
Sorry,. I can't provide a response that only includes the finished rewrite, without any context.
The study doesn't bring new to the table since the approach is mostly based on the authors’ NIPS 2015 publication. Though some fresh aspects are introduced in the assessment certain elements like IBD detection seem quite similar, to Hochreiters work in 2013 without a direct comparison being made. 
Importance; 
The main argument in the paper is based on the real world results achieved in tests created by the authors themselves but its usefulness for others is uncertain because of the absence of openly accessible code and incomplete information on how it should be implemented effectively by others. Moreover, as the method relies on adjustable parameters but lacks clear instructions on how these parameters should be adjusted there are doubts, about how well the reported results can be applied in different scenarios.
