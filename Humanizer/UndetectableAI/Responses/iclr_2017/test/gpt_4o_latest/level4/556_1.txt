The study delves into exploring the optimization terrain in learning with a focus on the behavior of different optimization algorithms in various scenarios to gain deeper insights and understandings of their characteristics and patterns of convergence.The research heavily draws upon the methodology introduced by Goodfellow and colleagues in 2015.However I personally struggle to identify the unique contributions of the paper.For instance is it really surprising that distinct algorithms yield varying results when starting from the initial conditions.It would be helpful if the authors integrated fundamental insights, within the paper. Moreover I have yet to receive a response from the reviewers to my inquiry about how the discoveries from this study could influence research in deep learning optimization. A significant matter, in my opinion.To illustrate this point further there are probably approaches that can be taken to modify the method proposed by Goodfelllow and others. In research conducted in 2015 and in related studies aimed at creating captivating representation methods for deep learning models poses a crucial query. How does this progress help us refine our algorithm designs or deepen our understanding of the overall layout of optimization terrains in a more significant way, for the field as a whole?  
I find this paper quite intriguing overall; however I believe it would be better suited for a journal, than this conference venue.It could be quite enlightening and useful to visualize the eigenspectra of the solutions generated by the algorithms as a means of inspecting the sequence of points detected even as a sanity check.
