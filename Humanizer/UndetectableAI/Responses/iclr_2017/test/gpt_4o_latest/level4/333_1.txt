This research presents a yet efficient starting point for parametric texture creation.The experimental analysis shows that the textures generated with this method. Using a mix of multi scale and random filters. Sometimes match those produced by the VGG based model that relies on pre trained filters, across multiple layers.The authors propose that creating textures may not always demand hierarchical structures or trained feature maps inherently. 
The research is. Stimulating to think about it deeply! However if we dig deeper into the findings about the significance of deep hierarchical representations they might need more evidence to support them properly. To clarify further the outcomes; both the VGG based model and the single layer model generated samples seem to be flawed and notably not as good as those made by parametric techniques. In terms of performance, in the inpainting task shown in Figure 7 that was presented the VGG based model seems to excel compared to other models. Could a hierarchical structure be more effective, in dealing with scale features compared to using multiple filters of different sizes?
