This paper presents a modified version of the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) technique that involves training a network to replicate the SVGD dynamics. This new method is utilized in adversarial training to create a training process that views the discriminator as a probabilistic model based on energy principles. 
I'm somewhat worried about the presentation because it seems to focus a lot on presenting the method as applicable but then only tests it in one particular situation This makes me question whether the paper truly shows how broadly useful the method is or if it spends too much time setting up SteinGAN without proving its effectiveness, with real world data. 
The data analysis in the paper doesn't fully back up the suggested method convincingly and as mentioned by another reviewer; DCGAN is starting to become a standard, for comparison purposes. 
In terms of quality assessment SteinGAN samples don't seem superior to DCGAN samples overall with the exception of the Celeb A dataset; although in this specific scenario the DCGAN samples don't quite align with those showcased in the initial DCGAN paperâ€”where exactly are these samples sourced from? 
In terms of numbers and performance metrics comparison between DCGAN and SteinGAN on ImageNet and CIFAR10 Inception Scores reveals an edge for DCGAN over SteinGAN in the former and a marginal lead for SteinGAN over DCGAN in the latter category. Also personally I feel that relying on the "testing accuracy" metric may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models capabilities since it focuses mainly on discriminating between different classes rather than assessing their overall modeling prowess at capturing details beyond just discrimination tasks such as background information, in images. 
Based on what I've mentioned on in this discussion I personally don't think this paper is prepared for release, at ICLR.
