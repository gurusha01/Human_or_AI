This research presents an approach for optimizing CNN training with piecewise linear nonlinearities in a step by step manner while transforming the sub problem into a latent structured SVM framework commonly used in academic studies." Furthermore " the study introduces improvements to the BCFW algorithm utilized in the optimization process." Although" the paper is interesting overall " the results, from the experiments lack persuasiveness. 
Advantages; 
Far as I know the new approach seems original and the authors have backed their method with a thorough theoretical analysis.   
The article is nicely. Written in a way that is easy to understand and access. 
Downsides; 
Although the technique can be used for structured prediction issues, in general terms the experiments only focus exclusively a straightforward multi category categorization job â€“ a factor that reduces the overall significance and applicability of the study.   
The accuracy of the test results seems uncertain based on the information provided here\. While the top performing model achieves a 70\. 20% Accuracy rate\. other approaches commonly show accuracies above 90%. This raises doubts, about the reliability of the reported figures\. For instance\.
