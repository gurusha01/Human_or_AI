This study focuses on the challenge of acquiring state representations using multi task reinforcement learning techniques. The researchers propose an approach that combines gated neural networks with multitask learning and incorporates prior knowledge, in robotics. They test their method on two simulated datasets. Show encouraging outcomes. The paper is clearly. Based on strong theoretical foundations. 
Advantages; 
The use of gate mechanisms to help in the development of a shared representation. 
Expanding on the concept of task learning beyond the limitations of single task approaches investigated in previous studies. 
Utilizing a blend of loss functions such as coherence and consistency, alongside causality and proportionality enhances the creation of a strong and reliable representation. 
Areas, for improvement; 
Choosing parameters randomly such as the "W parameters."
Multi task learning is limited to distinguishing between tasks of promoting the sharing and transfer of knowledge across tasks. 
Experiments were not carried out using a simulation platform like OpenAI Gym to improve comparability, between results. 
My suggestion is for the writers to follow a method when choosing model parameters and test their approach, on recognized complex datasets to enhance the quality of their research further.
