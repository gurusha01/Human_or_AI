This document presents a technique, for placing data points into a space without losing their similarity relationships intact. 
Although the paper presents this concept as new and innovative in essence; it aligns with the functionality already accomplished by pre trained embeddings (like autoencoders or word2vec); transforming elements into a compact space that naturally reflects their similarities. When focusing on word/context embeddings specifically; the suggested method isn't groundbreaking since it bears a strong resemblance to one of the similarity approaches outlined in "A Simple Word Embedding Model, for Lexical Substitution" (Melamud et al., 2015).The authors need to tune their arguments about uniqueness and effectively position their work in relation, to previous research studies. 
I also think that the assessment could use some enhancements and tweaks to make it better suited for evaluating word embeddings, in context.
