This study presents a technique that helps to tune deep convolutional neural networks using semi supervised learning methods.   
The researchers suggest using a model for filling in missing parts of images by training the discriminator to differentiate between completed images from actual data or generated ones while also learning to recognize objects in real images simultaneously through experiments to prove their methods efficacy by illustrating that the discriminators acquired features perform as well as or better than the best existing method in object recognition, on two different datasets.   
In conclusion the suggested approach seems like a yet powerful technique to improve the classification accuracy of CNN models.
