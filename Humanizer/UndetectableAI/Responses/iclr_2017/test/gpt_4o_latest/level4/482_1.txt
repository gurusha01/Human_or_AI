This paper is nicely. Well put together with a thoughtful presentation that makes it a pleasant read for sure! I appreciate the authors for their storytelling and clear explanations provided throughout the text. Although the paper doesn't bring in any methods or structures new, to the field of study; however it does address a significant issue  predicting a patients medication usage based on their billing code records. The dataset used is quite remarkable. Holds great value as it deviates from the usual small datasets often seen in machine learning experiments.. I felt that the thoroughness of the practical research was somewhat insufficient for a paper centered around real world uses.. NeverthelessI admired how the authors incorporated tools and methods like Keras and adadelata in their design which shows their dedication to utilizing state of the art methodologies.. Here are a few areas, for improvement that I'd like to point out..
The section on findings seems a bit short to me. Figure 4 seems more anecdotal and Figure 5 mainly highlights a negative outcome about tSNE being interpretable only, in certain areas of the study space. Placing Table 1 as the main source of concrete evidence presented in the papers discussion of results. I was expecting a thorough and detailed examination of the outcomes given that there aren't any groundbreaking algorithmic or theoretical advancements proposed in the paper. To be clear I don't consider this to be a flaw or something that disqualifies the work but it did leave me feeling somewhat unenthused. 
I suggest replacing Figure 5 with an insightful analysis of the models performance since the current representation provides little value and could be condensed into a brief explanation of a negative outcome instead of taking up space as a large figure. 
The article contains terms and assumes a certain level of knowledge that may not be common among the average ICLR audience member. Another reviewer proposed that this research could be more suitable for an healthcare oriented platform. Although I see where they are coming from I believe it's important to keep this paper within the ICLR community because insightful and detailed studies, like this contribute greatly to our field. To tackle this issue effectively and make the information more accessible to an audience of ICLR readers who may not have medical knowledge I suggest minimizing the use of technical terms specific to a certain field and explaining the findings in a manner that enables those, without healthcare expertise to analyze them critically. At present individuals lacking a healthcare background can only accept the data presented in Table 1 as is, of utilizing their quantitative skills to evaluate the results.
Overall this paper is well written. Holds substantial value.It presents an argument, with valuable insights and analysis.
