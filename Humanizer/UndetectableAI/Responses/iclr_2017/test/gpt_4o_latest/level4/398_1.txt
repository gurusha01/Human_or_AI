The writers of this study seek to explore whether disorderly patterns are necessary for recurrent neural networks (RNN) to excel in assignments successfully or not. To delve into this issue further the researchers introduce a structure that is purposely created to steer clear of chaos in RNN models. Their subsequent trials and tests provide evidence that disorderlinesss not a mandatory factor, for achieving favorable outcomes. 
This piece is, like a breeze of air! Of just offering small progressions as usual the writers kick off with a clear hypothesis and thoroughly examine it in their work. This method could set the stage for shaping principles in designing RNNs. 
One drawback of the research is that the tests are limited to tasks that are considered complex from a dynamic systems standpoint. It would have been stronger had the authors delved into a variety of data sets especially those involving chaotic dynamics, as a key factor.
