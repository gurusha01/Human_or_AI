This study uses a pointer network structure that incorporates an attention mechanism to identify elements in a given sequence and allows a decoder to produce those elements in order to solve basic combinatorial optimization challenges like the famous traveling salesman problem (TSP). The model is taught through reinforcement learning using an actor critic approach. The actor employs the REINFORCE technique while the critic estimates the reward baseline, in the REINFORCE goal. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to understand with its use of reinforcement learning and attention based models to analyze the patterns in solving combinatorial problems of different complexities seems fresh and creative.It also suggests a path for exploring traditional neural driven strategies for addressing combinatorial optimization problems using current sequence, to sequence techniques.This is why I think the paper should be taken into account for the conference. 
However I do have a thoughts and some major worries regarding the paper.
I don't think the pointer network approach can be used widely for all types of combinatorial optimization problems as suggested in the conclusion made earlier on this matter. The real challenge with combinatorial problems lies in the complex constraints that define workable solutions (, like extensions of TSP that involve time windows or multiple salesmen). Dealing with issues makes it much more difficult to eliminate unworkable solutions by simply excluding previously visited elementsâ€”finding even one feasible solution can be quite a daunting task indeed. It could be beneficial to talk about whether the Neural Combinatorial Optimization method can handle these intricate issue categories and if so how this could be accomplished. I believe that the current version of the suggested approach is mainly suitable, for tasks involving constraint setups. 
The field of operations research has created a database of standard test cases that are commonly employed to assess the effectiveness of solvers in various scenarios.TSPLIB is one resource that provides a wide range of instances, for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
