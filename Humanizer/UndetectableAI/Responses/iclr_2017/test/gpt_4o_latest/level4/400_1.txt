This article presents a version of a recurrent neural network with two distinct temporal dimensions that serves as a decoder to produce tree structures (including their layout) all within an encoder decoder framework setup. The suggested design is well supported. Opens up possibilities for various other uses (not just those outlined in the paper) where generating tree structures, from disorganized data is necessary. 
The paper has a limitation in terms of the experiments conducted as it could have delved into natural language applications that involve syntactic tree structures beyond the IFTTT dataset and synthetic dataset used for experimentation purposes; however I still consider the experiments presented to be satisfactory, as an initial showcase of the innovative architecture. 
One notable aspect of the paper is how the authors delve into design options, for the topology predictor elements within the framework. Specifically focusing on determining when and how to conclude instead of sticking to a single predetermined method. 
In terms I look forward to the potential future uses of this framework and see it as paving the way for exciting avenues in research.I suggest approving it as an addition, to the conference proceedings.
