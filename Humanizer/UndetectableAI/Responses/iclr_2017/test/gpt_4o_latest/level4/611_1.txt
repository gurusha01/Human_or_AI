The authors introduce a technique to develop user and item embeddings by using a neural network for recommendation tasks. However the new method, Dual_Nets shows some differences from the existing CDLf approach that also uses neural networks for similar tasks. In the assessment Dual_Nets incorporates more item features, than WMf and CDLf making the comparisons unfair.
