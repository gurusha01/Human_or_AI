The paper presents a platform called the Retro Learning Environment (RLE) for conducting research in reinforcement learning. Although the main emphasis is on Super Nintendo games in this platform design. The authors mention that it also works well with systems, like the Atari Learning Environment (ALE). The paper includes performance evaluations of algorithms across five recently introduced Super Nintendo games and some interesting insights using a unique "rivalry metric."
Evaluation frameworks that are commonly used in AI and machine learning research have significantly contributed to advancing the field over time through tools like datasets and competitions like the Atari Learning Environment (ALE) which is widely recognized as a key benchmark, for comparing algorithms in this space.The introduction of the RLE could present opportunities for researchers to delve into new and complex research domains. 
The main focus of this paper is to introduce the RLE framework and stress the significance of venturing into territories for exploration purposes.The outcomes of the experiments rely upon established algorithms.Although there are a few discoveries like the advantages of reward shaping and policy shaping (for instance favoring rightward movement, in Super Mario) these findings are somewhat expected given the acknowledged value of domain expertise. The idea of rivalry training is interestingâ€”practicing against an opponent can make you too focused on their strategies and make it harder to adapt when facing the games AI opponent later on. However it's strange that the final assessment is done against the, in game AI of the rival player. 
The part, in the paper discussing the findings and rivalry training is not very well written and lacks excitement overall. 
There could have been a scientific impact when introducing this new environment to the community. It's not certain if making such an impact is necessary for getting published. Its also unclear if ICLR is the right place for this research considering its main emphasis on the new codebase. Other platforms like mloss.org or the journal track linked to JMLT might be more fitting, for this kind of study.
