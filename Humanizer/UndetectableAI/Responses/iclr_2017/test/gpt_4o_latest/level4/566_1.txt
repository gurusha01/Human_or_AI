The article discusses a technique, for learning that picks small batches for deep learning by estimating the Bayesian posterior with some terms approximated along the way. 
The concept of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation in inference, for active learning is both fascinating and complex to grasp within the broader theoretical framework and its associated approximations. 
The document is not well written in English which can sometimes make it challenging to understand. 
The detailed descriptions of active learning methods contrast with the need for a clearer and more structured explanation of the proposed approach that relies heavily upon intricate approximations to be truly beneficial in comprehensibility and applicability to real world scenarios. Moreover the introduction of a dataset could bolster the research findings since the existing datasets such as gray digits and USPS exhibit similarities, in terms of their characteristics.
