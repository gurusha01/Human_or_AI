This study combines DRQN with eligibility traces. Investigates the utilization of the Adam optimizer to train the Q network in a promising research direction highlighted by experiments showing the benefits of including eligibility traces and Adam in two Atari games. However the methods lack originality leading to the contributions being (1) applying eligibility traces and Adam to DRQN and (2) the experimental assessment. The paper is well written and straightforward to understand. 
The tests involve a mix of findings and descriptive observations on how well the methods work and why they work that way. However the assessment is restricted to two Atari games, which makes it hard to judge how broadly the method can be applied. Adding outcomes from games or different areas would significantly improve the research paper. Also showing error margins, from random test runs would make the experimental analysis even more robust.
