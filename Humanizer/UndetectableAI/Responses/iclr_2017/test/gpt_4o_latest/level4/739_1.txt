The writers suggest a method for calculating polynomial attributes on Sparse Matrices in a more effective manner.The main idea centers around creating a connection between matrices and their polynomial forms to create an efficient CSR expansion method.They offer an evaluation of the time complexity with backing, from experimental findings. 
Overall the algorithm is interesting quite simple and well crafted with possible uses. However the paper does not delve deeply into its assessment and the examination of real world uses, for the suggested approach. Importantly it is uncertain how this study relates to ICLR s main objectives and it might be more fitting to submit it to a different platform.
