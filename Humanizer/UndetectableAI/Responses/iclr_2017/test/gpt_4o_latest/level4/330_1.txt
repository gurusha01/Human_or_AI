This paper describes a technique for creating vector representations of documents by employing a skipgram learning method along with a regularizer in the form of a context vector and several dropout mechanisms.The components introduced here are not new individually; however their integration in this way is creative.I also appreciated the examination of the models performance, in Section 3â€”it was informative and well done. 
The main downside of this submission is its real world testing which could be improved further for a more robust assessment of the methods effectiveness and applicability to various tasks beyond sentiment analysis and k way classification tasks; moreover investing a significant portion of the document solely, into t SNE projections seems like a missed chance to delve deeper into analysis and evaluation. 
While I have some concerns about the evaluations scope and I agree with reviewers on the soft baseline issue mentioned in this paper; however I believe that this paper should be accepted for publication, as the algorithm it introduces is intriguing and effective. It is likely that other researchers will see value in the concepts put forth here.
