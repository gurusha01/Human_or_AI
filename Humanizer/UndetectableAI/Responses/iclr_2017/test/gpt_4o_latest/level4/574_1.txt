The research presents an advanced visual search system created to find images of products that match a fashion item effectively and engagingly delves into the challenges within this field of study while addressing multiple obstacles, with its suggested methodology. 
Nevertheless. There are concerns that require attention. 
One major issue is the absence of any mention or comparison to the research done by Tamara Bergs team, on fashion identification and fashion characteristics.  
   "Uncovering and Describing Attributes Automatically, from Uncertain Online Information " presented at the ECC Vision Conference in 2010.  
   "Where can I purchase it? Discover streetwear outfits showcased in web stores " presented at ICCB 2015.  
   "Examining Comparable Fashion Trends in Analyzing Apparel " TPAMI 2014  
   Without looking at and comparing it to all the research done in this area extensively it's hard to determine the value and originality of the suggested method. 
The paper lacks information regarding the attribute dataset and how it was collected. Such as the origin of the images and whether they are product images or real world ones; how the annotations were created; what instructions were given to annotators; and what specific annotations were gathered. Even though proprietary data statistics may not be necessary for publication purposes these qualitative specifics are essential for comprehending the significance of the research contributions and facilitating comparison, with others work. 
There are some foundational points that are not present here. For example; how do the findings in Table 2 stack up against more straightforward approaches, like the BM or CM methods referenced earlier in the text? 
The paper presents an analysis; however these issues need to be resolved before it is deemed ready, for publication.
