The article discusses the pressing issue of errors in health records (EHR) specifically the absence of current medications in patient files. The authors suggest utilizing neural networks, like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to anticipate the types of medications a patient might be using based on their recent 100 billing codes sequence. The research shows that GRUs perform better than models, with a micro average AUC of 0.e03 and a Label Ranking Loss of 0.e75.This indicates that these models could help with medication reconciliation and enhance the accuracy of EMRs. 
Verdict issued. Approval granted.   
The study is clearly motivated as it delves into a yet overlooked aspect of computational medicine.The method put forward is backed by scientific principles as it utilizes a vast dataset of 3300000 instances and showcases promising practical outcomes.The innovative use of RNNs to grasp the relationships within billing codes is commendable and seamlessly fits into existing research while tackling a distinct forecasting challenge.The findings are persuasive, with proof that the models can detect omitted medications and might enhance medical processes. 
I'm here to provide some reasons, in favor of the topic.  
The research paper addresses an issue, in healthcare by using RNN technology in a new way to show how it can be useful when dealing with time sensitive information in the medical field.   
The experiments are well crafted as they compare RNNs with feed forward networks and random forests while using evaluation metrics like AUC and Label Ranking Loss for the multi label prediction task.The authors also consider label noise, in the data. Interpret their findings cautiously.   
Empirical Findings; The impressive results of the GRUs along with real world examples showcasing its predictions lend credibility to the assertions made in the research paper. Additionally the analysis of embeddings accentuates the versatility of the acquired knowledge, for practical use cases. 
Suggestions to enhance;   
The authors mention label noise in a manner; however an in depth analysis quantifying its effect, on model performance would enhance the paper further.   
The article could provide insights, on how the model can be incorporated into world clinical practices and verified through practical application.   
Model Scalability is a consideration according to the authors, who highlight the limitations posed by hardware in terms of model size and performance optimization capabilities on improved computational resources would be beneficial, for making the paper more practically applicable.   
Adding features, like patient demographics and lab results could enhance the accuracy of predictions and should be considered for future research endeavors. 
Questions to ask the writers;   
How does the system manage billing codes or types of therapy that are not often seen in the dataset?   
Could the writers please give information about the random exploration, for fine tuning hyperparameters and the scope of values experimented with?   
How can the models predictions be confirmed against a trusted standard in an environment when there is recognized variability, in labeling accuracy?   
Could the knowledge gained from this research be used for purposes like predicting how diseases progress or analyzing similarities, between patients?   
In general this paper provides a contribution to the field, with the potential to greatly enhance the accuracy of EMR and improve patient care.
