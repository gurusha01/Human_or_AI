Ways to Enhance Your Work
The paper is well written overall; however there are an areas that could be improved to make it even clearer and more impactful. 
The tests only focus one dataset (World Cup 2014). Although this dataset works well to showcase the models abilities; conducting tests with broader and varied datasets, like Freebase or WordNet would enhance the credibility of its generalizability claims. 
The paper should consider the computational burden of the Gaussian attention model in contrast to simpler methods such as TransR especially in terms of scalability, for larger knowledge bases. 
The model operates under the assumption of having an oracle for identifying entities—an approach to the problem at hand. It would be beneficial to explore how the model could interact with entity recognition systems, in practical scenarios. 
The authors briefly touch upon the idea that the Gaussian attention model generates results that can be easily understood such, as attention weights but they do not delve deep into this aspect. Provided visualizations or real life examples showcasing the learned attention distributions would enhance the clarity of the models functioning. 
Queries, for the Writers 
How well does the Gaussian attention model handle knowledge bases containing millions of entities and relations and have you tried it out in such scenarios to see how it performs? 
Could the program manage relationships that're not commutative or tackle more intricate reasoning challenges like reasoning across multiple steps, along extended paths? 
How much does the model react to the selection of hyperparameters like the size of embeddings and the terms, for regularization of variance? 
Could we use the attention model for tasks other, than knowledge base embedding like document retrieval or recommendation systems? 
Overall this paper provides an addition to the field by presenting a new and efficient attention mechanism for knowledge base reasoning. With experimentation and examination it has the potential to establish itself as a cornerstone, in this domain. I suggest accepting it.
