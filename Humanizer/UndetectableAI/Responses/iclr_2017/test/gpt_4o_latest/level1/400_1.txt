Summary of the Document
Key Points of Contribution 
This paper presents a neural network design called the Doubly Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) which is tailored for decoding tree shaped objects from encoded representations.The design includes two recurrent modules to capture both ancestral (parent to child relationships ) and fraternal (between siblings ) information flow.This capability allows the model to create tree structures explicitly and make predictions, for node labels at the time. The authors have suggested a method for predicting topological patterns without relying on artificial padding tokens which leads to a more efficient and compact tree formation process.The DRNN model is tested on three tasks including identifying hidden tree structures from sequences,natural language translation to functional programs and machine translation.The experiments show that DRNN models perform better than existing methods in tasks related to tree creation and show features such, as structural consistency and gradual decoding. 
Verdict reached is approval.
Main factors contributing to approval; 
The new DRNN design stands out in research for its focus on capturing tree structures and node descriptions within a frameworkâ€”a valuable addition, to the realm of structured data analysis. 
The study offers experimental proof across various tasks to show how well the suggested approach works and why it outperforms current methods. 
Points, in favor 
The paper is well positioned within the existing literature. Provides a comprehensive review of previous studies on the topic, at hand.The authors effectively outline the drawbacks of techniques and demonstrate how DRNNs offer solutions to these issues.One notable advancement is the representation of tree structure which surpasses traditional approaches using token padding or rule based classifiers. 
The experimental findings exhibit scientific validity and rigor.To assess performance accuracy and quality of programs appropriately for the given tasks while comparing them to baselines in a fair and well documented manner. 
The DRNN structure is evaluated across a range of assignments to showcase its flexibility effectively. The outcomes on simulated tree reconstruction making programs and translating languages indicate its capacity to manage both task specific trees and sequence, to sequence tasks well. 
Tips, for Enhancement 
The paper is well detailed in its aspects; however it could be clearer in explaining the DRNN architecture in Section 3. The mathematical notations used may pose a challenge for readers who're not familiar with tree based models. Including a diagram that showcases the backward passes in the DRNN could enhance understanding, for all readers. 
The paper would benefit from the addition of ablation studies to pinpoint the impacts of elements, like individual ancestral and fraternal recurrences and the explicit topological prediction mechanism. 
Scalability Consideration; The writers discuss the possibility of utilizing batch processing on GPUs without presenting any proof to support it. It would be beneficial to have an evaluation of the computational effectiveness and scalability of DRNN models in comparison, to current approaches. 
Error Examination; Although the outcomes show progressiveness in various areas of study like machine translation studies and its applications, for real world scenarios; a thorough analysis of errors is essential to understand the models boundaries and enhance its capabilities moving forward.
