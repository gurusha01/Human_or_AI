Presenting the reasons.
The paper addresses an significant issue in the field of AI. Navigating through dynamic environments with limited visibility effectively and efficiently by leveraging auxiliary tasks to overcome obstacles such, as sparse rewards and memory constraints as supported by existing research literature and clearly explained. 
In the experiment part of the study is where the researchers tested their method in five 3 dimensional maze settings and compared it with established methods to see how well it performs across various scenarios.The outcomes revealed an enhancement, in learning speed and task completion with their proposed approach particularly shining in dynamic environments that require strong memory skills. 

The method could have implications that reach beyond just navigation tasks and extend to other non navigation tasks as well which indicates its overall usefulness, in reinforcement learning. 
Ways to enhance it
Ensure understanding of how auxiliary tasks are designed in the paper; although the tasks are well thought out and make sense logically speaking it would be beneficial to include more insights into why predicting depth as a classification task yields better results compared to regression tasks in terms of performance enhancement. Moreover discussing the rationale behind selecting loop closure thresholds (η₁, Η₂ ). Their influence, on overall performance could add significant value to the paper.
The paper mentions SLAM briefly. Does not directly compare it with other methods, which could enhance the credibility of end, to end RL approaches. 
The paper mentions challenges, in managing mazes that are generated procedurally and suggests that future research could delve into how external memory structures might tackle this obstacle. 
Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis; Although the study demonstrates stability in response to varying hyperparameters tested in the model settings; a deeper exploration into the effects of hyperparameters such, as auxiliary loss weights could provide valuable insights.
