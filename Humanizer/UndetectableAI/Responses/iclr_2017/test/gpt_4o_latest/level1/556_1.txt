Lets take a look, at this review.
Key Points of Contribution
This research delves into exploring the shapes of loss functions within neural networks and investigates the dynamic interplay between these loss surfaces and different stochastic optimization techniques employed in the field of deep learning. The study involves a range of experiments utilizing cutting edge network designs such as VGG, NIN and LSTM in conjunction with optimization strategies, like SGD, ADAM, RMSprop among others to delve into the characteristics of local minima. The article presents ways to visually represent complex data by using unique methods, like barycentric and bilinear interpolation to simplify the understanding of high dimensional loss surfaces in a more accessible manner. One important finding is that various optimization techniques lead to outcomes when aiming for local minima despite starting from the same point initially; these minima also showcase varied characteristics. Furthermore the authors suggest enhancing optimization strategies by incorporating second order Runge Kutta integrators and evaluating their effectiveness. The study also looks into how batch normalization and different initializations impact the loss surface and training results. 
Outcome Determination. Denial 
Although the paper discusses an issue and offers intriguing real world observations; it lacks depth in some aspects leading to rejection for two main reasons—firstly due to inadequate theoretical basis or elucidation of the observed occurrences; and secondly because of unclear reasoning and precision in linking the empirical findings to the wider implications regarding optimization and generalization, in deep learning. 
Reasons to back up the decision.
The paper offers a wealth of real world data yet falls short in providing a rationale for why various optimization algorithms lead to unique local minima or the variations in loss surface shapes, near those minima remain unexplained hindering the broad applicability of the conclusions. 
   
The paper shows that using optimization techniques results in reaching different local minimum points but suggests that these points yield similar overall performance in generalization terms; this poses doubts about how meaningful the disparities in the geometry of loss surfaces truly are, on a practical level. 
The idea to incorporate Runge Kutta integrators is interesting; however the outcomes indicate performance levels.The comparison between ADAM and its RK augmented version demonstrates that ADAM performs better, than its enhanced counterpart using RK integration method.This challenges the assertion that this approach offers an enhancement. 
The document is quite dense and hard to understand in sections – especially the parts discussing the experiment setup and results.It's not always easy to see how the specific research findings tie back, to the research questions. 
Ways to enhance your work.
In the context of theory development; present a robust theoretical groundwork, for the observed occurrences by explaining why various optimization techniques result in different local minimum points and how this correlates with the shape of the loss landscape. 
Explaining the importance of the discoveries is vital here; consider how variations in the structure of loss surfaces could impact aspects like resilience in models or their applicability, across different scenarios in reality. 
Upon examination it is important to delve into why the RK4 method may not perform in certain scenarios, such, as when paired with ADAM optimization algorithm for instance and explore the possibility if adjusting formulations or parameters could enhance its efficiency. 
Ensure that you make the experimental setup and results easy to understand by simplifying them providing summaries and emphasizing important discoveries more effectively. 
Batch Normalization Review; The exploration of batch normalization is intriguing lacking depth in its coverage. Perhaps elaborating on this examination could offer profound insights, into how it influences the loss surface. 
Queries, for the writers 
Why is it that local minima discovered by optimization methods exhibit similar overall performance in terms of generalization despite their distinct differences, in loss surface structure? 
Are there any connections between the variations in the shape of loss surfaces (like the size of basins) and real world advantages like being resilient against attacks, from adversaries or performing better on data sets? 
What theoretical principles underlie the variations, in the shapes of loss surfaces across optimization techniques and is it possible to anticipate or measure these distinctions beforehand? 
Why doesn't the RK embedding enhancement work to enhance results, with ADAM optimizer technology and could it be because RK embedding doesn't mesh well with ADAMs learning rate system? 
Overall the paper has some points to offer but it needs to be more grounded in theory and clearer, with practical relevance in order to meet the conferences standards.
