Overview of Contributions
This study explores how eligibility traces and recurrent neural networks (also known as RNNs) are utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on their application in the Atari domain specifically to tackle issues in scenarios with limited rewards and incomplete observability by merging eligibility traces that carry rewards across various time steps with recurrent networks that offer memory for time related dependencies.The research also delves into examining the effects of optimizers such, as RMSprop and Adam on training effectiveness. The researchers showcased how eligibility traces enhance the learning process and stability in two Atari games. Pong and Tennis. While Adam boosts learning speed significantly.In Tennis specifically RNNs coupled with eligibility traces achieve perfect performance a feat that eludes other reinforcement learning methods.The paper delves into an analysis of the experimental findings and suggests future avenues to explore such as adjusting the frequency of updates, for frozen networks. 
Verdict given for approval.
The research paper adds insights to the deep reinforcement learning domain by delving into a less explored territory. The fusion of eligibility traces and recurrent networks. The practical outcomes are convincing as they showcase advantages in terms of how quickly learning occurs and the consistency it offers. The study is well founded in existing literature. Maintains a high level of scientific integrity. That being said there are areas where enhancements could be made to the paper particularly concerning how clear and, in depth the analysis is. 
Pointing out reasons 
The combination of eligibility traces with RNNs in RL is groundbreaking and tackles key obstacles in scenarios with limited rewards and incomplete observability.The research also sheds light on the territory of optimizers in RL training—an insightful addition, to the field. 
The experiments are well planned and thorough; they include comparisons between setups such as the presence or absence of eligibility traces and the use of RMSprop versus Adam optimization methods. The findings are reliable. Offer compelling support, for the arguments presented. 
The results have real world significance for enhancing reinforcement learning algorithms in scenarios such, as Tennis where current approaches face difficulties. 
Ways to enhance 
The paper is quite detailed but can be hard to follow at times due to its complexity in explaining eligibility traces such as forward, vs view; adding simpler examples could make it easier for readers to understand. 
The paper suggests that hyperparameters like how the frozen network is updated could impact performance limitations and recommends a more thorough examination of hyperparameter sensitivity to enhance results and offer practical guidance, for practitioners. 

Ablation Studies Investigation; In the research papers exploration of models with and without eligibility traces is informative; further ablation studies such, as testing different λ values or trace cutoff thresholds could offer a more comprehensive understanding of how eligibility traces impact the learning process. 
Queries for the Writers. 
How much do the outcomes change based 0n the selection of λ (, for example when λ equals 0. 80)? Would using larger values for λ have a noticeable impact 0n how well it works?t
Did you notice any compromises, between how you learn and how steady your progress is when comparing Adam to RMSprop optimizer algorithms and is there a way to measure this more precisely? 
Have you thought about trying out the suggested method, in situations where thingsre not entirely clear to see how well RNN and eligibility traces can show their advantages? 
Is it possible to change the update frequency of the network dynamically while training to maintain a balance, between stability and learning speed? 
In general I believe this paper adds insights to the deep reinforcement learning domain and could have an even more significant influence, with some small enhancements suggested for acceptance.
