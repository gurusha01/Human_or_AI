The research paper discusses a visual search tool designed for fashion items that aims to locate comparable products by analyzing an input image query effectively tackling the complexity of defining similarity in the fashion domain by introducing more, than 90 attributes related to fashion and modeling them through a recurrent neural network (RNN). The system integrates both similarity through fashion attributes and visual similarity through region of interest (ROI) based characteristics to enhance the precision of item retrieval. The paper also presents a ResCeption network based on the Inception v4 model and shows its success, with attribute recognition and transfer learning tasks alike. This system is created to perform well at scale through an inverted indexing method and feature representations that are encoded as digits to cater to e commerce applications effectively. 

Although the paper covers an issue and showcases technical thoroughness the rejection stems from two main factors; (1) The methods proposed lack originality as they mostly draw from existing techniques like using RNNs for multi label classification and Faster R CNN for ROI detection. (2) The empirical evaluation section lacks clarity and detail in illustrating the systems practical implications and comparing its performance, with baseline models. 
Here are my supporting points; 
Strengths; 
   The article is clearly inspired by real world issues within the realm of online shopping. 
   Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to understand the connections, between attributes seems like a method to adopt and combining semantic and visual elements appears to be a valuable addition. 
   The ResCeption network demonstrates encouraging outcomes in transfer learning tasks and the systems ability to scale using inverted indexing is praiseworthy. 
Weaknesses, in the system include the following points; 
   The originality of the method is somewhat restricted since the strategies like RNN and Faster R CNN're widely recognized techniques in this field already established for some time now.. Although the adaptation, to fashion search is intriguingly applied in this context; however the study doesn't bring forth fresh methodologies. 
   The practical findings do not include analysis against top performing benchmarks, in the field currently used for fashion search systems or other multi label classification techniques. 
   The assessment criteria (such as precision and recall metrics ) are mentioned for identifying attributes; however the effectiveness of the system in practical situations, like user contentment and retrieval accuracy is not thoroughly examined. 
   The paper lacks ablation studies to clearly distinguish the impact of specific components such, as ResCeption compared to standard Inception v 2 and RNN compared to simpler multi label classifiers. 
Here are some ideas, for how you can enhance your work; 
Please present a detailed juxtaposition between the latest techniques, in identifying attributes and conducting visual searches incorporating numerical measurements and real world instances to underscore the benefits of the suggested approach. 
Perform experiments where you assess the effects of elements like ResCeption and RNN based attribute modeling as well as the inverted indexing approach, through ablation studies. 
Can you explain how well the system works in real world situations regarding its ability to handle a number of queries or larger sets of data effectively? 
Enhance the clarity of the empirical findings section by providing, in depth descriptions of the experiments conducted well as the datasets used and evaluation methods employed. 
Incorporate feedback from users or real life implementations to showcase how the system can be practically useful and influential, on shopping platforms. 
Queries for the writers; 
How does the new system measure up against fashion search systems in terms of accuracy of results and satisfaction of users? 
What extra processing power is needed when using ResCeption and RNN models in comparison, to basic architectures? 
Could you please share information, about how the inverted indexing system affects the speed of retrieval and memory usage? 
How well does the system handle input data that's noisy or incomplete such, as low quality images or missing metadata?
In essence although the paper discusses an issue and showcases technical expertise its lack of originality and inadequate empirical validation restrict its impact, on the field. Tackling these issues could greatly enhance the paper for submissions.
