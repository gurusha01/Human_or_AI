The research paper introduces a method for improving the Skip Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model by using a Riemannian optimization framework effectively. The authors suggest an approach to solving the SGNS optimization problem through a two step process which involves identifying a low rank matrix to optimize the SGNS objective directly and then deriving word and context embeddings from this matrix. The main innovation lies in employing a projector splitting algorithm, for optimization, which streamlines the optimization procedure while still ensuring computational efficiency. The new technique surpasses the existing methods, like SGNS enhanced through stochastic gradient descent (SGS) and SVD concerning the SPPMI matrix regarding both the SGNS goal and language similarity measurements.
