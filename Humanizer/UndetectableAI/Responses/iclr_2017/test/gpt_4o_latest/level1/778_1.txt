"In brief"
This research introduces an approach to speeding up and reducing the size of complex neural networks during testing by breaking down weights and activations into integer and non integer parts.The main idea is to estimate the weight matrix as a result of multiplying a matrix (containing values { 2 0. 2}) With a numeric coefficient matrix and splitting activations, into binary vectors plus a bias term. This method allows for forward movement using logical functions such as AND and XOR operations while also considering bit count calculations to facilitate its use on energy efficient CPUs or custom hardware setups. Tests conducted on three networks—MNIST CNN, VGG16 and VGG Face—showed notable speed enhancements (up to 15 times faster) and reduced memory usage (up to 5. 7 %) All with minimal impact on accuracy (such as only a modest 1. 95 % Rise in five error rates, for VGG16).The approach is introduced as a system that merges matrix factorization and integer decomposition without the need for retraining or modifications, to the training procedure.

Reasons, for Support 
The paper tackles an issue of implementing deep neural networks on devices with limited resources—a relevant concern as the need for edge AI applications grows rapidly today.The rationale behind this research is well explained. The approach is situated within existing literature by leveraging previous studies, on matrix factorization and integer decomposition. 
The method suggested is thoroughly developed with mathematical explanations and an elaborate description of the optimization procedure in place.The experiments conducted are inclusive as they encompass datasets and architectural models while also incorporating studies to assess the significance of key parameters such, as kw and k x. 
The findings strongly back up the assertions made in the study.The technique brings about speed enhancements and reduces memory usage while maintaining accuracy effectively.However the comparison, with constraints clearly demonstrates the superiority of the ternary method. 
Ways to enhance your work
The paper provides technical information but could improve clarity in certain sections such, as simplifying the explanation of binary activation encoding in Section 4 for better readability. 
The paper mainly compares its approach to constraints and a few previous studies but could benefit from a more extensive comparison with cutting edge network compression techniques, like pruning and quantization aware training to enhance the assessment. 
Hardware Validation Assessment; Although the approach is tailored for energy processors and custom hardware components in mind; the trials conducted were solely carried out using a regular CPU unit. Displaying the effectiveness of the approach with hardware accelerators such, as FPGAs or ASIC chips would significantly boost its practical applicability. 
The experiments only focus on CNN based architectures; it would be beneficial to explore how the approach could apply to architectures, like transformers or graph neural networks.
