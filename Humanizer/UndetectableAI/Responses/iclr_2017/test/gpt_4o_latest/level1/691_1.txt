The article presents the Retro Learning Environment (RLE) a reinforcement learning (RL) system that enhances the functionalities of the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). RLE accommodates games from gaming systems, like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis introducing fresh obstacles owing to the elevated intricacy and variety of these games. The writers emphasize advancements such as the flexible structure of RLE that enables seamless incorporation of new games and consoles and the introduction of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) features.. The study also showcases test outcomes that reveal the constraints of RL algorithms on SNES games while underscoring the necessity, for stronger and more adaptable strategies. 
Verdict reached. Approval granted. 
Top factors contributing to approval; 
A new addition to the field is the introduction of RLE as a RL environment surpassing the complexity of ALE with its modular and adaptable nature that promises enduring value for research, in RL. 
The experiments are well crafted. Offer valuable insights into the constraints of existing RL algorithms with the addition of scenarios involving multiple agents and experiments, in reward shaping enhancing the depth of the assessment. 
Here are some points to consider; 
The paper is firmly grounded in existing research. Improves upon the achievements of ALE while acknowledging its drawbacks. The authors extensively compare it to environments like OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Lab to highlight the necessity, for RLE. 
The findings are strong. Point out the difficulties presented by SNES games like delayed rewards and complex action spaces in noisy environments The tests conducted with multiple agents and reward adjustment provide valuable insights into the capabilities of RLE to push forward research, in reinforcement learning.
