Overview of the Document 
The paper introduces a type of policy gradient for reinforcement learning without models that enhances exploration capabilities. This fresh method called Underappreciated Reward Exploration (UREG) encourages the exploration of action sequences leading to rewards than anticipated by the model. UREG combines a mode seeking goal ( REINFORCE method) and a mean seeking element to strike a balanced approach, between exploiting known rewards and exploring new possibilities. The researchers test UREx using algorithmic challenges and show notable enhancements compared to standard methods, like entropy adjusted REINFORCE and one step Q learning techniques.
