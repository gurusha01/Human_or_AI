Synopsis 
The study introduces a method for navigating challenging environments with limited rewards by focusing on internal drive rather than external stimuli. The writers define surprise as the difference between transition probabilities and those predicted by a trained model and present two estimates. Surprise and k step learning progress. They illustrate the benefits of these factors across various settings such, as continuous control exercises and Atari games surpasses traditional exploration strategies in terms of effectiveness. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and findings I have chosen to approve it for two main reasons; first and foremost is the strong foundation, in existing literature that underpins the approach and secondly the real world data clearly highlights how the suggested incentives can yield positive outcomes across different scenarios. 
Reasons, for Support 
The document offers an succinct overview of addressing exploration challenges in intricate domains highlighting the importance of intrinsic motivation as a driving factor behind it all.The authors delve into an analysis of relevant studies effectively outlining the uniqueness of their methodology when compared to established techniques.The empirical findings are comprehensive showcasing the effectiveness and resilience of the suggested incentives, across settings. Comparing Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) a reinforcement learning algorithm in the paper to other methods, like Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIEM) enhances the papers credibility and effectiveness. 
More Feedback is Needed 
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the authors delve deeper into explaining why they chose hyperparameters specifically focusing on the KL divergence step size and the sub sample factor. It would also be beneficial to have a comparison of the speedup in relation to VIME along, with a detailed breakdown of the time costs associated with each approach. Lastly I would appreciate it if the authors could clarify how the proposed incentives relate to Bayesian surprise as discussed in Section 3. 1. 
Queries, for the Writers 
Could you give me information about the hyperparameter selection process, for the KL divergence step size and the sub sample factor? 
How do you intend to expand on this research to tackle intricate settings like ones, with extensive state and action variations? 
Could you give me a thorough examination of the improvement, in speed compared to VIME and also break down the time expenses associated with each approach?
