The study introduces a multiscale method known as the Hierarchical Multiscale Recurrent Neural Network (HM RNN) that aims to grasp the hidden hierarchical arrangement in sequences by incorporating temporal relationships with varying timescales through an innovative updating technique.The researchers assert that their model is capable of underlying hierarchical patterns in sequences, without relying on explicit boundary details. The study assesses the suggested framework through character level language modeling and handwriting sequence creation assignments and attains top notch outcomes on the Text 2 collection while showing outcomes to existing achievements, on the Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia datasets. 
"I've chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because it addresses a significant issue within the realm of recurrent neural networks by focusing on learning hierarchical and temporal representations; and secondly because the proposed approach is well reasoned and backed by empirical data demonstrating the models ability to uncover hidden hierarchical patterns, in sequences leading to improved generalization performance."
The document offers an detailed explanation of the proposed models workings and how it is updated as well as the process for detecting boundaries. The authors conduct an analysis of the findings with visual representations of the hierarchical structure they learned and the frequency of updates, in each layer. The paper is structured well with concise writing. 
To enhance the papers quality further I recommend including in depth comparisons with research like the Clockwork RNN and the Hierarchical RNN. Moreover adding an analysis of the hierarchical structure learned and its connection to the datas fundamental structure would be beneficial. Questions that I hope the authors address are; (1) How does the suggested model manage sequences, with lengths and complexities? Could the writers offer explanations on the acquired boundary detectors and their connection to the fundamental data structure? How does the suggested model stack up against models that incorporate explicit boundary details, like the Hierarchical RNN?
