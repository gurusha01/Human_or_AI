In brief
The study delves into how various ways of representing actions impact the process of learning to navigate articulated figure movement using deep reinforcement learning methods.The researchers compare four representations of actions. Torques,muscle activations target joint angles and target joint velocities. And assess their influence on the time taken to learn the stability of policies the quality of movements and the frequency at which policies are queried.The findings indicate that representations incorporating feedback,such, as target joint angles and muscle activations tend to enhance policy performance and speed up the learning process across a variety of movements and body shapes. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and approach to the impact of action parameterization on dynamic articulated figure locomotion control learning process I have decided to approve it for two main reasons; Firstly the paper addresses a well defined and meaningful question with clear motivation.Secondly it offers an meticulous assessment of various action parameterizations along with an in depth analysis of results a consideration of constraints and potential directions, for future research. 

The research is quite compelling since it focuses on an area where our knowledge of deep reinforcement learning falls short â€“ the influence of action parameterization on mastering complex system control tasks is explored in depth by the authors in an easily understandable manner in the opening section of their paper.They explain the rationale behind the action parameterizations they examine with clarity and precision.The paper also fits within the existing body of work, on deep reinforcement learning and biomechanics. The authors thoroughly assess ways to set action parameters and discuss the results comprehensively while also highlighting limitations and potential future research directions in a scientifically sound manner based upon a well executed experimental evaluation. 
More Input Required, for Better Understanding 
To enhance the document further I recommend the writers offer information regarding how they applied the actor critic learning algorithm by specifying the hyperparameters and optimization method utilized. Moreover the authors might delve deeper into exploring uses of the findings, such as applying action parameterizations in robotics or computer animation. Furthermore they may wish to assess how well the policies perform on intricate tasks, like 3D locomotion or manipulation activities. 
Queries, for the Writers 
Could you please provide details on the points that need clarification, from the authors?
How did the authors decide on the configurations of actions they examined in the research paper and what criteria did they use to pick them? 
Could the writers offer information regarding the method employed to fine tune the actuator parameters, in the muscle activation model and its practical application? 
How do the writers intend to expand the findings to 3 movement and what difficulties and constraints might they face in doing so?
