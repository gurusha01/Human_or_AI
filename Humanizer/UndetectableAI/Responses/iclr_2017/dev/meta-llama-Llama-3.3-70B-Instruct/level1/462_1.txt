In a nutshell.
The study introduces a method for identifying adversarial changes in deep neural networks by adding a small "detector" subnetwork to the classification network.The detector is educated to categorize data from data with adversarial changes through a binary classification assignment.The findings illustrate that adversarial changes can be identified effectively despite being nearly imperceptible, to humans. The detector adapts to less potent opponents as the creators suggest an innovative training approach to thwart ever changing adversaries seeking to deceive both the classifier and the detector. 
Choice
Sure! Here is the paraphrased text; "I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because it addresses a significant issue within the realm of deep learning regarding the susceptibility of neural networks to adversarial alterations and secondly because the method presented by the authors is logically sound and supported by evidence, from experiments showcasing the detectors ability to identify these adversarial changes effectively."
Reasons, for Support 
The paper offers an succinct overview of the challenge posed by adversarial perturbations and the shortcomings of current solutions in tackling this problem effectively. The authors present a method that diverges from previous approaches and showcase through experiments the detectors ability to identify adversarial perturbations successfully. Additionally the paper delves into an examination of the findings highlighting how well the detector can adapt to various adversaries and remain resilient, against changing threats. 
Extra Input; Comments
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the writers include information about the design of the subnetwork detector and the specific parameters used during detector training.In addition it would be intriguing to observe trials, on how well the detector can perform across various datasets and network structures.Furthermore the authors might want to explore using the detector as a method of regularization to strengthen the classifiers resilience against instances. 
Queries, for the Writers 
Could I kindly request the authors to elaborate on the following topics;. How are the authors intending to expand their method to identify alterations in more intricate datasets, like ImageNet?. Could the authors offer explanations regarding the characteristics that the detector acquires to spot deceptive alterations?. What are the strategies that the authors are considering to tackle the risk of overfitting of the detector to an adversary during its training process?
