Key Points, from the Paper
The article suggests a method for creating host intrusion detection systems (IDSs) focusing on anomalies using a language modeling technique based on system calls. The researchers utilize a language model. Particularly a long short term memory (LSTM ) network. To grasp the semantic significance and connections, between system calls. To minimize alarms they introduce an ensemble approach that merges various thresholding classifiers. The effectiveness and adaptability of the suggested system are verified on benchmark datasets. 
Choice
"I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons; Firstly because it addresses a crucial issue in computer security and the proposed method is well supported by existing research.
