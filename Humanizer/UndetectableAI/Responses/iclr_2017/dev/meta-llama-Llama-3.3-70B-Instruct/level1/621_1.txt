The research article introduces a method for creating music with the help of machine learning by investigating the application of blocked Gibbs sampling as a way to simulate the human creative process in composition work. The writers introduce COCONET as a neural network within the NADE generative model family and show how it enhances the quality of samples compared to conventional ancestral sampling techniques. The study suggests that this method offers a natural approach to music composition similar, to human creativity with encouraging enhancements observed in sample quality. 
After reviewing the paper carefully​ I have decided to approve it because the approach seems grounded and backed by real world data​. The authors clearly outline the drawbacks of ancestral sampling techniques and show how their new blocked Gibbs sampling method is more effective​.
The study presents evidence to back up its arguments with visual aids depicting the composition process and contrasting them with conventional approaches. The reasoning behind employing blocked Gibbs sampling is soundly. The outcomes indicate noteworthy enhancements, in sample accuracy. Moreover the authors conduct an examination of the factors contributing to the enhanced efficiency by linking it to the superior modeling of conditional distributions. 
To enhance the paper more effectively; I propose delving deeper into the specifics of how the COCONET model and the blocked Gibbs sampling procedure were implemented. Moreover; it would be beneficial to incorporate an extensive analysis of the sample quality through quantitative assessments measuring the coherence and diversity of the music produced. Furthermore; I am curious about the authors intentions regarding expanding this method to tackle intricate tasks, in music generation like conditioned generation or composing for multiple instruments. Could the authors offer information, on the computational expenses involved in using the blocked Gibbs sampling technique as opposed to conventional methods and how this could affect the scalability of the approach?
