Summary 
The research paper presents a type of recurrent neural network structure known as the Input Switched Affine Network (ISAN) which outperforms existing models in a language modeling task while also being easier to understand and more computationally efficient than traditional RNN setups. The ISAN model utilizes affine transformations without elements enabling straightforward analysis and breakdown of the networks output predictions. Through experiments on the Text8 dataset and in depth analyses provided by the authors they showcase the effectiveness of the ISAN model. Offer insights, into how the network generates its predictions. 
Choice
"I've chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because it addresses a significant issue in the realm of neural networks concerning the interpretability challenges faced by conventional RNN models and secondly because the method proposed shows strong reasoning backed by detailed analyses and experiments."
Arguments, in favor 
The article presents a defined and organized introduction to the issue at hand and the suggested solution in a clear manner. The writers justify the importance of neural networks and detail how the ISAN model meets this requirement. The results of the experiments prove that the ISAN model performs similarly to RNN models, in language modeling tasks but is more efficient and easier to interpret. The papers analyses include breaking down predictions by referencing past time steps and adjusting references to provide valuable understanding of how the network predicts outcomes. 
More feedback is needed. 
To enhance the paper further I recommend that the writers compare the ISAN model with interpretable neural network designs and address the potential limitations and obstacles of this model. Also it'd be beneficial to include visual aids and instances to showcase how interpretable the ISAN model is. Some queries I'd like the authors to address are ; ( 1 ) How does the ISAN model deal with words or characters that're not in its vocabulary ? ( 2 ) Can the ISAN model be utilized for tasks, than language modeling ?How does the practical computational efficiency of the ISAN model compare to that of RNN models?
