The research paper titled "Introducing Leakiness to Restricted Boltzmann Machines with Leaky Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)" introduces a method for enhancing Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) through the incorporation of leakier ReLU activation functions instead of traditional ones, like Sigmoid or Tanh functions. 
"I have chosen to approve this paper for reasons; Firstly the approach is well founded and the authors offer a detailed explanation of the background and previous studies on the subject matter. The papers position within existing literature is solid showing the authors grasp of research in the field. Additionally the paper backs up its assertions, with theoretical analysis and real world assessments." The writers thoroughly explain how the leak hopscotch machine benefits, from a sampling technique they introduce by testing it on standard datasets to prove its efficiency. 
The paper makes three contributions; (1.) The authors carefully. Tackle model limitations in leakier RBM. (2.) They introduce a meta algorithm for extracting samples from RBM by adjusting leakiness during Gibbs sampling. (3.) They showcase the effectiveness of the sampling technique in computing the partition function and training the model successfully. Based on results presented in the study the new method proves superior, to the traditional annealed importance sampling (AIS) algorithm in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. 
I believe the paper could benefit from delving into how the proposed method could impact the field of deep generative models as a whole and including more visual representations of the images generated by the leaky RBM model to showcase its ability to create new content effectively. Furthermore it would be great to have some clarification, on how adjusting the leakiness parameter influences the models performance.Can the new sampling technique work with kinds of RBMs or deep generative models as well? How does the computational expense of this method stack up against other sampling methods, like AIS or contrastive divergence?  
The research paper makes an addition to the deep generative models field and could become a powerful publication, with a few small improvements.
