Summary 
The paper suggests a method for combining decisions at the level of choice to classify products in ways by utilizing both text and image data inputs enhancing accuracy in real world product classification tasks, from Walmart.com when compared to individual deep neural networks trained for each input source. 
Choice
Sure I have chosen to approve this document for the following reasons; 
The article addresses an issue within online shopping. Product categorization. And introduces a fresh method to combine written descriptions with visual content, for improved accuracy. 
 The authors thoroughly examine the mistakes made by networks and showcase the benefits of incorporating multiple modes of operation. 
Points, in Favor 
The research paper is well thought out and the approach fits nicely within the existing literature context.The authors give a summary of the obstacles in product categorization and the drawbacks of current techniques.The innovative decision level fusion strategy presented displays encouraging outcomes.The experiments are well thought out. The findings are carefully scrutinized.In addition, to that the authors delve into an exploration of both the possibilities and constraints of their method. 
More Input Required 
To enhance the paper further would be by suggesting the authors delve into greater depth about how they collected the dataset and conducted preprocessing tasks in detail. Moreover a compelling addition would involve studying the categories of products that gain the most advantage from utilizing a multi modal strategy. Additionally the authors might want to expand their work by comparing with cutting edge techniques and exploring potential uses of their approach, in various fields.
