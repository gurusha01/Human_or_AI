The key. Contributions highlighted in the papers summary.
The study introduces an advanced multi view learning approach known as the Variational Canonical Correlation Analysis (VCCA). This model expands upon the idea of linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) interpreting it within a variable framework and utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for nonlinear observation models. Additionally the authors present a modified version of VCCA called VCCA private that's capable of identifying shared as well as individual variables, across different perspectives. The research paper showcases how VCCA and VCCA private excel in multi view representation learning assignments such as pairing images with images or speech with articulation and matching images, with text datasets.
