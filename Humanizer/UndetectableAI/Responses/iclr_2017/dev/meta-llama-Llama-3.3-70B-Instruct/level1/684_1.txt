Summary 
The research paper introduces a model driven strategy for deep reinforcement learning known as Predictive Reinforcement Learning (PRL). PRL involves training a model of the environment to aid in decision making processes and addresses the challenges faced by conventional Q learning techniques when handling multiple tasks and requiring extensive interactions with the environment. The study showcases the efficiency of PRL in mastering tasks concurrently by successfully playing three Atari games and achieving performance levels that exceed those of humans without any decline, in performance quality. 
Choice. 
Based on two factors. Firstly addressing a notable issue in reinforcement learning called multi task learning with a fresh and well founded method and secondly showing through experiments how effective the approach is, in handling multiple tasks at once. I have chosen to approve this paper for publication. 
Here are some points to consider.
The article presents a defined and organized overview of the PRL method by explaining the models structure and training process in detail. Moreover it thoroughly analyzes the outcomes by comparing them to models trained on tasks. The introduction of a type of recurrent neural network known as Residual Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN) is a noteworthy advancement because it simplifies learning intricate environments with minimal memory usage. 
More Input Needed 
To enhance the paper more effectively I recommend that the authors delve deeper into explaining the hyperparameter tuning process and how the results vary with different hyperparameter configurations. Moreover it would be intriguing to witness experiments conducted in various settings and tasks to showcase the versatility of the PRL method. Lastly the authors might want to explore real world applications of PRL in areas, like robotics or self driving vehicles.
