This research introduces a method for understanding the unchanging attributes of flat curves through a convolutional neural network (CNN) system. The writers make use of CNNs ability to calculate geometric properties like curvature and show that their method surpasses conventional axioms in terms of numerical reliability and consistency. Additionally it presents a level representation model that enables a step by step examination of curves, at different levels of detail. 
Choice
After consideration of the papers content and approach to addressing the challenge of learning geometric invariants effectively and with motivation in mind; I have decided to approve it for publication based on its clear introduction to the issue at hand and a comprehensive review of relevant research, alongside a well articulated explanation of the proposed methodology. 
Reasons, for supporting 
The research paper backs up its arguments by conducting a variety of experiments that showcase the strength and efficiency of the suggested method. The authors illustrate that their approach can effectively manage noise levels fluctuations in sampling and occlusions while also surpassing techniques in terms of numerical consistency. Furthermore the paper offers an easy to understand description of the multi scale representation concept, which presents a fresh perspective, in this area of study. 
Further Input; Comments
To enhance the paper further suggestions I have are; the authors should elaborate more on how they implemented the CNN architecture by sharing the hyperparameters and explaining the training process in detail. Moreover adding visual representations of the identified invariant signatures and showcasing their use in shape analysis and retrieval tasks can be beneficial. Lastly discussing any constraints of their approach and proposing paths, for future research could also be worthwhile. 
Queries, for the Writers
To make sure I grasp the paper correctly I'd appreciate it if the authors could respond to these questions; 
Could you offer information, about how the negative examples were constructed for the training dataset? 
How can you make sure that the identified constant patterns truly remain unchanged despite changes, like rotations and reflections?
Could you talk about how the idea you're suggesting could be used in areas, like computer vision or medical imaging?
