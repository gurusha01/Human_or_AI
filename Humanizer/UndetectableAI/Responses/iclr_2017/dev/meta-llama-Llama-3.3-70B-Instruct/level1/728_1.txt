Key Points of the Papers Assertions and Contributions
The paper presents the Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) which is a new method for examining trained policies in Reinforcement Learning (RL). According to the authors claims in the paper; SAMDP simplifies the analysis of policies by introducing temporal and spatial abstractions to create a clearer and more understandable representation of the policys actions. The study illustrates how SAMDP is effective across tasks such, as solving gridworld problems and playing Atari 2600 games; it also highlights its utility in monitoring and enhancing the reliability of trained policies.
