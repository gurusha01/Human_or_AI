Summary.
This research paper explores how neural networks without training and with randomly assigned weights and biases behave based on mean field theory principles. The authors introduce two distinct depth scales. Œûùëû and Œûùëê. Which govern the transmission of information relating to the intensity of an input and the relationship between two inputs. They demonstrate that at the threshold between order and chaos in networks Œûùëê shows divergence potentiality that enables the effective training of significantly deep networks, near critical points. The writers also create a field theory to explain the process of backpropagation and show a connection between forwarding signals and reversing gradients in their research work. They confirm their findings through tests, on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets by demonstrating how the depth scale Œæc effectively forecasts the adjustable parameters feasible range.
