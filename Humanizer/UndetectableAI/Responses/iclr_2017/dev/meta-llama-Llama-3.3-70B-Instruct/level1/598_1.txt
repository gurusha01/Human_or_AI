Here's the summary.
This study introduces a speech recognition system that integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a graph decoding method trained using a straightforward sequence criterion known as AutoSegCriterion (ASG). The system is crafted to generate letters directly from the speech signal without requiring the alignment of phonemes, by force. The authors show performance, on the LibriSpeech dataset with word error rates (WER 7· 9 using Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCS) and 10· 9 using power spectrum and raw waveform features respectively. 
Choice
"I have chosen to approve this paper for two reasons. Firstly because the approach is well founded and fits within existing literature while tackling a crucial issue in speech recognition; secondly because the paper backs up its arguments with thorough experiments and results that showcase the efficacy of the suggested ASR criterion and the system, as a whole."
Presenting. Points, for Consideration 
The article offers an succinct overview of the challenges in speech recognition and the shortcomings of conventional methods.The authors justify their method by emphasizing the importance of a streamlined and effective system that can extract knowledge from unprocessed speech data without depending on forced alignment or phonetic transcription.The findings from the experiments showcase the effectiveness of the suggested approach displaying Word Error Rates (WER) that're on par, with cutting edge systems. The authors also thoroughly examine the ASR criterion. Highlight its benefits compared to the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTCC).
Extra Input, for Enhancement 
To enhance the quality of the paper further I recommend that the authors delve deeper into how they implemented the ASG criterion by discussing the optimization algorithm employed and outlining their approach to tuning hyperparameters. Moreover it would be valuable to explore experiments testing the systems resilience to various forms of noise and diverse speaking styles. Lastly the authors should contemplate offering an in depth analysis of the systems computational efficiency by detailing factors such as memory demands and processing duration, for larger datasets. 
Queries, for the Writers
