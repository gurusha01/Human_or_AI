Brief Overview 
The research introduces a neural comprehension system known as Dynamic Chunk Reader (DCR) designed to identify and prioritize potential answers within a text to respond to queries effectively.The DCR model can predict answers of lengths and address various types of questions – both factual and non factual.It employs a deep learning strategy along, with a unique attention mechanism and incorporates five straightforward yet impactful features. The researchers assess the performance of DCR using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (abbreviated as SQuAD) achieving a 66. 5 % Exact.  74. 9 % F ₁  score.

Arguments, in favor 
The research paper discusses an issue, in understanding written text. Predicting answers that vary in length is difficult.The authors suggest an attention mechanism and an integrated deep learning method.This enables the model to create and prioritize answer options dynamically.The outcomes achieved with the dataset are remarkable and the authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how well the model performs.This evaluation includes analyzing errors and conducting tests without components. 
More Feedback Required
To enhance the quality of the paper further I recommend that the authors delve into depth regarding how they implemented the model. Including specifics like hyperparameter configurations and the training process. Additionally it would be beneficial to incorporate visual aids like attention weight plots to offer a clearer insight into how the model functions. Lastly the authors might want to explore testing the model on datasets, like CNN/Daily Mail to showcase its versatility and effectiveness. 
Queries for the writers.
Could you please share information, about how the attention mechanism is put into practice in terms of selecting hyperparameters and carrying out the training process? 
How do you intend to tackle the challenge of anticipating responses that typically involve opinions rather, than just factual information? 
Have you thought about testing the model on datasets, like the CNN/Daily Mail dataset to show how well it can adapt to various scenarios?
