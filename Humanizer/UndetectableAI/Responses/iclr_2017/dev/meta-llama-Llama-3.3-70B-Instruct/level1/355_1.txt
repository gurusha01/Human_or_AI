The research introduces an approach to teaching a virtual agent to play the First Person Shooter game Doom based on visual input by combining deep reinforcement learning with curriculum learning using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C). The design of the framework is straightforward as it only utilizes game states from the AIs perspective and demonstrates performance in the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 where it significantly outperformed competitors to emerge as the top contender, in Track 1. 

After consideration of the papers content and research findings presented within it regarding the training of AI agents in complex 3 dimensional environments with partial observability issues; I have chosen to approve it for publication based on two main factors.The first reason is the papers focus on addressing an difficult challenge in the field of AI training.The second reason is the rationale behind the proposed methodology and its validation, through empirical evidence showcasing its efficacy. 
Reasons, for Support 
The document offers an brief overview of the challenge of instructive AI characters in first person shooter games and supports the adoption of deep reinforcement learning and educational learning methods.The suggested structure is carefully crafted with an account of the network design training process and teaching strategy.The practical outcomes display the efficiency of the suggested structure as the trained character secures victory in Track 1, at the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016. 
More Input Required.
To enhance the paper more effectively I recommend that the authors delve into additional specifics regarding the hyperparameter tuning process and examine alternative reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q Networks (DQN) or Policy Gradient Methods (PGMs). Moreover the authors might also think about including visual representations of the agents actions,such, as heatmaps or videos to offer a clearer insight into the decision making process of the agent. 
Questions to Ask the Writers
To make sure I've grasped the paper correctly I have a questions, for the authors; 
Could you give me information, about how the curriculum learning approach works and how it manages the complexity of the tasks involved? 
How do you manage the balance, between exploring and exploiting in the suggested framework. What are the consequences of incorporating entropy regularization? 
Could you give me information, about how the agent acts in various situations and the strategies it uses to make decisions and adjust to different circumstances?
