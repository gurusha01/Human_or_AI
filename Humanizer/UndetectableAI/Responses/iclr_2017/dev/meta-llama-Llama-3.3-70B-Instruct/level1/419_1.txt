The research paper introduces a language model named Topic RNN that combines the advantages of recurrent neural networks (RNNS ) and latent topic models to understand both short term and long term connections, in language usage effectively.In their findings the authors suggest that Topic RNN surpasses contextual RNN benchmarks in predicting words and delivers comparable outcomes in sentiment analysis tasks. 
After consideration of this papers content and arguments presented within it. I have chosen to approve it for two main reasons; Firstly the methodology is well founded in existing literature and serves as a strong foundation for the study. Secondly the paper offers evidence, from empirical research to substantiate its assertions. 
The authors offer an comprehensive overview of the background information and previous studies in the field while showing a solid grasp of the pros and cons of current language models.The TopicRNN model they propose is well crafted with the incorporation of inference to understand the model parameters better being a notable aspect.The outcomes observed in word prediction and sentiment analysis are remarkable and are accompanied by an, in depth examination that includes representations of the identified topics. 
To enhance the paper more thoroughly I'd appreciate a deeper exploration of the following aspects; (1); The impact of selecting different topic models (such as LDA versus correlated topic model ), on Topic RNNs effectiveness (2); The possibility of utilizing the model for various natural language processing tasks aside from word prediction and sentiment analysis. Moreover having instances of text generated by the model would greatly aid in comprehending its functionalities better. 
I have a questions for the authors to help me better grasp the papers content; (1); How do the authors decide the best number of topics for a specific dataset? (2); Can the model handle words not in its vocabulary. Does it need extra preprocessing steps? I find the paper well crafted. Believe that the model they propose could have a big influence, in natural language processing.
