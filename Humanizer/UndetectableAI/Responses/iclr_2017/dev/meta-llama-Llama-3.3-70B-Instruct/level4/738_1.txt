The use of sparsity, in adjusting the gradients during LSTM training has shown interesting outcomes.The paper seems unfinished as it lacks experimental validation.Solely presenting validation loss is not sufficient; incorporating testing outcomes and standard evaluation metrics is essential to support the argument that the suggested sparsity approach does not impact performance.Also including proof of the speed and efficiency improvements obtained through this method would greatly strengthen the papers credibility.
