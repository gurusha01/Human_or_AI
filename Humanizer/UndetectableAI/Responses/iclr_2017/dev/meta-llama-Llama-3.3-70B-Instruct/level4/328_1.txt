This research paper explores how nonlinear recurrent neural networks can effectively model neural response characteristics that have been difficult for other models to capture accurately. A complex recurrent neural network (RNN) with layers is taught to mimic the way real retinal ganglion cells respond to a series of natural images. The RNN demonstrates performance compared to standard linear nonlinear (LN) and generalized linear models (GLM) especially, in explaining short term responses. 
This study marks an advancement in comprehending how visual neurons exhibit nonlinear response characteristics. Recent discoveries have underscored the complexities in interpreting how retinal ganglion cells react to natural movie stimuli using receptive field models. This poses a hurdle for researchers, in this field. Creating a model though still in its initial stages serves as a crucial starting point. Therefore this research should be recognized as a contribution. The next obstacle involves understanding the mechanisms of the neural network (RNN) which may entail pruning and simplifying to pinpoint key elements. Despite the lack of an analysis, at this stage it is important to note that the initial findings are significant and merit consideration. 
In this case I find the term "movie" confusing in its meaning here as it seems to describe a series of unconnected images shown for a brief duration each second; although the reference to a frame rate of 1, in 1/~0?83 milliseconds appears to relate more to the screens refreshing pace.  
In my opinion using dynamic natural scenes or actual movies could lead to more noticeable differences, from the LN model. In these situations the RNN might have an influence and produce more valuable outcomes.
