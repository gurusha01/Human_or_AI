This document provides an succinct story that offers results that are easy to understand.  
It's fascinating to see variations among different parameterizations even though they all result in generating torque outputs since theres a known conversion function available to switch between representations or torques. One possible reason, for the advantage of proportional control might be linked to how the tracking cost is influenced by positional data.  
It'd be interesting to see what happens if we take out the reference pose cost and just focus on the locomotion cost to see if the results stay the same.  
Moreover​ exploring an activity like playing with a spinning top could lead to varied results​ indicating that the conclusions might be specific to the task, at hand​. 
While the research is interesting in itself its relevance, to situations seems somewhat constrained which hinders its overall applicability.  
The video that comes with it is nicely. Really adds to the manuscript.
