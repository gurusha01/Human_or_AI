In this paper we introduce a framework that uses reinforcement learning to automate the creation of network structures. Of manually designing each layer and its parameters at every step an agent is tasked with choosing a new layer type and its settings. To simplify the decision making process the authors have limited the design choices. 
The main highlights of this project are; 
A novel method has been introduced for designing network architectures automatically by using reinforcement learning techniques. 
Showing results across various standard datasets, like MNIST and CIFARâ€“10 is quite promising. 
There are a few drawbacks that have been observed.
The decisions made in designing the architecture are limited by preset assumptions like a restricted variety of convolutional filter quantities and a maximum of two fully connected layers, with set dropout rates. 
Although the technique is demonstrated within the framework of tabular Q learning its effectiveness, in extensive state action spaces is still unclear. 
In summary this study suggests an fascinating method, for crafting neural network structures worthy of being published despite a few drawbacks.
