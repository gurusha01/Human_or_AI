The writers present NVI for versions of LDA and compare them with well known inference methods like CGS and online SVI.They also evaluate how well NVI works with the ProdLDA model; however its uniqueness, in the field of topic modeling remains uncertain. 
The papers approach is praiseworthy as a whole and NVI exhibits potential for LDA usage.However the results of the experiments blur the line, between model and inference performance making it hard to grasp the importance of the discoveries.Furthermore the authors fail to address hyper parameter selection discussions,a factor that significantly influences topic models effectiveness.This omission complicates assessing when the suggested method will prove effective. 
To improve the outcomes further and enhance the precision of the findings creating datasets with different Dirichlet distributions and testing the effectiveness of the suggested approach, in accurately determining the actual parameters could be advantageous. 
Figure 1 seems unclear because it mentions sparsity while using "log p(topic proportions)" as a label on​ the y axis​.  
In Section 3A of the document mentions that the term "unibody," concerning the softmax framework appears vague. When looking at a Dirichlet distribution on the K simplex with a concentration parameter of alpha/K and where alpha is less, than 1 resulting in a multimodal distribution; it is not clear if the softmax framework still displays multimodal characteristics. 
The absence of error bars, in the findings gives rise to uncertainties regarding their validity. 
Some small recommendations involve changing the term, in formula (2) try "reconstruction precision" or "reverse reconstruction mistake" for better understanding. Moreover the idea of employing an inference system has already been investigated in the past as shown in the Helmholtz device.
