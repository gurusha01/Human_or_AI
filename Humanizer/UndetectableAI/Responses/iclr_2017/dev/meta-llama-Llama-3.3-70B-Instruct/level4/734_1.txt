This document delves into a method using a deep neural network to understand various perspectives of information to create a complex model that presents challenges, in drawing conclusions; these challenges are tackled through the use of the Variational Autoencoder (VAF).
The authors argue that the similarity between this model and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is unproven since the connection between the proposed model and canonical correlation directions in the linear scenario is uncertain. On the hand methods such as Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCE) and Deep Canonical Correlation Autoencoders (DDCAE) directly include canonical correlations, in their goals and offer explanatory perspectives. Bach and Jordans research shows that when estimating a latent model through maximum likelihood estimation process yields canonical correlation directions; however the discussion of this in the current paper is missing which raises doubts, about labeling it as a CCA type model. 
Additionally the article fails to consider an amount of relevant studies on non linear multi view models. These include probabilistic (as referenced in [2] [3]) and Bayesian (as referenced in [4]) methods well, as variations related to variational and deep learning (as referenced in [5]). 
Despite these constraints mentioned above the concept of integrating multi modeling with VAEs is quite fascinating and could be beneficial in practical applications as well. However the research paper lacks a demonstration of a clear approach to extending VAEs to multiple perspectives. The proposed VCCA model does not seem to push the boundaries in terms of performance improvements compared to existing methods. Moreover the VCCA private model appears to be defined as it requires manual adjustment of dimensionalities and relies heavily on dropout techniques to prevent redundancy in information processing. The experimental outcomes, for VCCA private are also not very impressive.  
Furthermore the estimated posterior distribution is defined based on one perspective restricting the models usefulness as a versatile multi perspective solution. When prioritizing classification tasks it would be more suitable to compare it with a classifier, like a feedforward neural network. 
The figures in Figure 8 are quite interesting. The paper effectively shows the benefits of combining different perspectives with VAEs. However it lacks evidence of how practical the suggested method's its relation, to CCA. Overall even though the document is engaging more work is needed to address these issues.
