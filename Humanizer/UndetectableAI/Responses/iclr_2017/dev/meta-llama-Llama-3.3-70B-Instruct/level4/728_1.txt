The paper starts by emphasizing the need for techniques that can handle both state and temporal representation learning in reinforcement learning (RL) along, with offering an understanding of the learning process that could allow intervention when needed.This aim holds practical value and its encouraging to observe research endeavors aimed at achieving this objective.As a result I highly suggest the authors to persist in exploring this research direction. However I do have some concerns about how this project's currently structured; my worries come from how its presented and the potential drawbacks, in its concept. 
The authors use abstraction techniques to achieve "interpretability " like starting and ending skills in individual states and using clustering to create more advanced states. These limitations might seem confining without a clear explanation for why they are needed beyond convenience. Similarly the method of maintaining consistency appears quite limiting. The authors mention material that is meant to explain these decisions but it was not available, in the paper that was shared. Authors must ensure they offer explanations, for these specific decisions or possibly loosen these restrictions while still prioritizing understandability. 
In terms of presentation quality improvements for the paper include adding definitions for AMDP and SAMDP along with detailed mathematical explanations of the algorithms involved in creating these models like the Bellman equations and update rules. Even though the paper provides to understand explanations of these concepts it lacks precise mathematical statements which are vital for clarity. Furthermore there is a need to address the resources required to construct an SAMDP such, as time and space usage. 
The experimental part is nicely done; it includes both gridworld experiments for visualization and understanding and Atari games as well.The outcomes seem promising; however the methods complexity with its reliance on specific decisions leaves the significance and general usefulness somewhat uncertain for now.Having access, to all the materials could have shed more light in this area. 
There are a small errors in the notation and an incorrect symbol, in the equation that comes after Equation 2.
