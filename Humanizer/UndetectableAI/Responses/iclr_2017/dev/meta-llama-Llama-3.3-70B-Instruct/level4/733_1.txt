This document suggests a method for detecting intrusions on a system using anomaly detection techniques. It uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze sequences of system calls and determine behavior that may signal an attack. Furthermore the study examines an approach alongside two standard models, for classification tasks. 
The paper is strong because it presents its ideas clearly and in a planned manner while effectively communicating the concepts discussed within it. Additionally it demonstrates an use of LSTM sequential modeling, for addressing issues related to Host Based Intrusion Detection Systems (known as HIDS).
After taking a look at the papers content overall and considering the key technical elements like LSTM RNNs and ensemble techniques which are already widely used in the field; it seems that there might be limitations in terms of originality. One major point of concern is whether the proposed ensemble method truly brings much new value as claimed since the concept of ensembling could potentially be applied to baseline models, like kNearest Neighbors (KNN) and kMeans Clustering (KMC). This aspect calls for exploration to fully understand its impact.
