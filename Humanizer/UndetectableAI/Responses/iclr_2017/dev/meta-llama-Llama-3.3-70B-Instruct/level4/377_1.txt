This study delves into how physical interactions can be used to predict outcomes in the realm of physics without knowledge of rules or properties using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). While the approach taken by the authors is unique and thought provoking within the machine learning communitys interest in understanding physics some aspects of the papers contributions are still ambiguous, from my perspective. 
The unique experimental setups stand out as they seek to establish the importance of blocks or recognize connected blocks based solely on physical interactions like pushing and pulling without any prior knowledge provided beforehand.The study showcases results in these experiments by offering elaborate descriptions, for each scenario tested. 
The experiments have sparked curiosity and discussion. Its unclear how groundbreaking or significant the findings really are as theres a question about whether this work brings fresh perspectives to the field or not.The tasks involved in these experiments may not be that different from Deep Reinforcement Learning tasks like mastering game environments such as Atari games which could mean they are less challenging or unique, in comparison. In order to improve the paper further I suggest that the authors should explore the analysis of learned representations thoroughly or talk about how the experimental results are connected to human behavior or natural laws and characteristics. 
In my opinion the final evaluation is a bit of a bag. But I am inclined to suggest accepting it based on the strength of the concept presented in the paper; however I believe a more detailed examination would enhance its overall quality. 
There are a particular aspects that require more explanation or thought; 
Reconsidering the belief that interaction's essential for acquiring knowledge, about physical attributes is important since observation alone could also aid in learning. 
Figure 1 needs a label, on the Y axis for clarity. 
The connection, to bandit problems is intriguing; however the formal method heavily depends on reinforcement learning (DRL).
Detect the two blocks apart is tricky because of a slight weight gap; it's odd that a machine might struggle with this since even small speed variations could be detected unless its a network architecture limitation. 
Using feature observations for the rest of the experiments based on training times might be justified by demonstrating a connection between performances, at the individual level. 
Many findings rely heavily upon the training datasets characteristics, like task complexity. Could benefit from cross validation across different datasets to validate their reliability. 
Adding a method, for comparison would improve how we assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
