This design showcases a method by gradually collecting and improving mistakes while analyzing a video sequence and demonstrating a distinct learning process. 
The video that comes with it really helps to understand how the networks information flows better and putting a link to it in the paper would make it easier to read. 
The model created by the authors is designed for KITTI and has been fine tuned with settings but does not reach the level of effectiveness seen in Finn et al.s work, from 2016; however it outperforms the advanced model introduced by Mathieu et al in 2016. 
The differentiation between the training and testing sequences in video prediction lacks benchmarks which results in varying sequence selections by different authors causing confusion The performance, on the H36M Walking videos is slightly disappointing when compared to Finn et al (2017).
