Apologies for the tardiness, in sending over my feedback. 
This paper introduces a method for determining the structure through framing it as a supervised classification task; given an empirical covariance matrix of observed data as input and producing a binary decision, on whether two variables are linked as output. 
One standout feature of the paper is the findings showcased in the experimental segment that illustrate how this straightforward method surpasses older approaches that are not learning based in nature.This discovery is. Carries important consequences, for challenges related to uncover the underlying structure. 
In my view the creation of the learning approach is a practical effort to tackle this issue even though it doesn't introduce any groundbreaking technical advances. For example coming up with an algorithm that remains unaffected by data rearrangement could have been an avenue, for technical innovation. Yet the authors do not assert anything in this regard. The approach is well developed and efficiently implemented. 
The writers have done a job of clearly presenting the theoretical concepts, in the paper.The findings are easy to understand. I like that the assertions are clearly articulated even if they aren't unexpected.  
The paper concludes by stating that graph estimation could be considered a learning challenge where training data from one source helps understand the structure of new and unseen test data from another source.The authors suggest that while this method may offer benefits with solid empirical evidence it might also raise concerns about interpretabilityâ€”a point they recognize as a potential focus, for future research efforts. In general this marks a starting point; there's room, for enhancement but it holds its own.
