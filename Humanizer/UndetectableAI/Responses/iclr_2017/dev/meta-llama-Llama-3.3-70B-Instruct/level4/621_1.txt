This article discusses how music can be created using a NADE model for the task of filling in missing notes in a sequence of pitches over T timesteps.The model is trained by masking some pitches at random and predicting the missing notes according to the training method, for orderless NADE models. Usually in the sampling process they use sampling where they set an order for the outputs and keep running the model step by step based on the current input by selecting one output at each step and adding it to the next input until all outputs are selected. According to the authors this method of sampling is not very effective so instead they suggest using the blocked Gibbs sampling method which was presented by Yao et al back, in 2014. This technique includes hiding a set number of inputs and then sampling them repeatedly to improve the mixing of the sampling chain with a focus on larger sets of inputs (N). However using a N may lead to disjointed samples because of their lack of interconnectedness. To tackle this issue the writers introduce an approach to adjusting N over time. Slowly decreasing it until eventually resorting to ancestral sampling. To establish an overall structure, for the sample. The study showcases a range of tests using measurements and assessments, by people to show that blocked Gibbs sampling outperforms other sampling methods. 
The article is nicely. The authors have done a great job in communicating their findings effectively.However I am mostly concerned about the value of the contributions made by this paper in relation to a submission.After reading Uria and Yaos work I am uncertain, about how significant this papers contributionsre.If this paper were to be submitted to a conference focusing on music or art it would probably be accepted.Yet in terms of ICLR I find it lacking in originality compared to the works it references since it does not prioritize orderliness. NADE is a known model with similarities to the blocked Gibbs sampling and annealing scheme found in Yaos work The key innovation in this study is its focus on applying these methods to the realm of music and discovering that Yaos approach proves more successful for sampling music This finding holds particular significance, for individuals operating within the music domain If the authors could show that these findings are relevant in areas like images (such as CIFAR or tiny ImageNet) or text (like document creation) I might change my assessment and suggest accepting this paper for ICLR conference review process to consider for acceptance is justified based solely experimental evidence provided in the paper. Exploring musical styles apart, from Bach chorales could also be insightful to broaden the scope of research topic However drawbacks current experiments make it difficult to fully support acceptance recommendation at this time.
