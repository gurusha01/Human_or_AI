This research introduces a time based recommendation system that uses point processes with user and item latent features that change over time in sync through processes called coevolutions.The interactions trigger updates in user or item representation, by integrating representations before time t.The system is designed to handle inputs and is tested against different benchmarks using various datasets. 
The paper makes contributions, to various important aspects of the field. 
Recommendations are created using point processes in this model where the parameters behavior is influenced by hidden user and item characteristics. 
A new optimization technique is presented to enhance the chances of this procedures success by using technical methods to reduce its natural complexity. 
The study performs assessment trials centered on suggestions that vary with time. 
However the study shows striking similarities to a publication by the same researchers (NIPS 2016) outlining a related concept of continuous time coevolution and a similar evaluation method The key distinctions are found in the details of the model, like the point process and factor dynamic model; yet the general approach and discussions remain mostly consistent.. This prompts inquiries about which particular elements of the updated model enhance its performance compared to the earlier version â€“ like the process chosen or the new set of parameters used in it. Regrettably though the paper fails to provide reasoning behind opting for the point process form. Does not delve into other possible forms. Likewise the decision to use a linear function (sigmoid function) to model latent user/item vectors appears restrictive without a thorough discussion, on how it affects the models performance. 
The assessment approach presents two standards. Lacks clearness  particularly in terms of how item suggestions are evaluated at each time point ts occurrence is captured in the model or not predicting the following item a user will engage with post time t remains opaque as well as the importance of temporal anticipation, as an indicator of recommendation excellence is inadequately elaborated upon a contrast involving the computational intricacy or runtime of various methodologies would offer beneficial perspectivesUnderstanding the limitations of this approach is essential as it seems that the complexity increases in relation, to the quantity of items and users involved. 
The paper seems researched and offers a unique perspective; however it lacks certain specifics and bears similarities to the authors prior work that may question its originality.The evaluation methods and the models ability to handle datasets are areas that require more thorough explanation.Altogether the authors should do a job in showing how this study significantly progresses from their past work contributions.
