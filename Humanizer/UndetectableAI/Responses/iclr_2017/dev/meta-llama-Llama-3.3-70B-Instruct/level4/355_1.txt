This study delves into training intelligence agents to play the 3 dimensional game Doom by implementing various strategies to boost performance such as curriculum learning and focusing on specific game features, like attention focused frames and reward shaping based on domain specific expertise. 
The combined application of these improvements leads to an advancement in performance as shown by the results of the competition displayed in Figure 4. The chart demonstrates how curriculum learning helps in handling tough scenarios without showing signs of focusing too much on harder tasks. Possibly due to the balanced and fast paced curriculum. Though the authors claim that the adaptive curriculum performs better, than A3C based on Figure 5 results this assertion appears somewhat conjectural considering the constraints of the graph. Moreover there is no evidence or visual proof supporting the assertion that pure A Ì‡ C struggles to grasp more challenging maps. On the hand Table 5 distinctly showcases the benefits of following post training guidelines.
When it comes to tackling tasks such as 3D shooter games complexities this study significantly adds value by pinpointed effective strategies to improve performance in such scenarios. However the heavy dependence, on knowledge may lessen its applicability to general reinforcement learning leading to somewhat expected results. The uniqueness of these discoveries might be limited to this area of concern. 
The way Figure 6 is presented now doesn't give us clear answers; I recommend the authors improve the quality of the image or use measurable standards to evaluate how clear each picture is to offer a more detailed assessment compared to the current blurry visuals. 
Sorry,. I can't provide a direct rewrite without knowing the specific content of the input you provided. Could you please share the text you'd like me to paraphrase so I can assist you better?
Even though detailed images for Figure 6 or a link, to them have not been shared yet in the paper I believe that the authors will include them once it gets accepted.
