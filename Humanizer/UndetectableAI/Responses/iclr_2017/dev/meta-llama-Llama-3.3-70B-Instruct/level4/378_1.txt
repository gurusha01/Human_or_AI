This document introduces a method for promoting the exploration of less explored areas with rewards in a unique way It suggests using importance sampling as a simple adjustment to the REINFORCE algorithm Experimental findings, from different toy tasks show that the suggested model outperforms both REINFORCE and Q learning algorithms significantly. 
The research paper shows promise in exploring automated algorithm discovery using reinforcement learning techniques but the main goal of the study is not entirely clear from the content provided. If the main objective is to improve exploration in policy gradient methods it would have been helpful for the researchers to compare their algorithm with established reinforcement learning tasks. Considering the existing body of work on enhancing REINFORCE it raises some concerns that the authors chose to compare their approach, known as UREX with a version of REINFORCE, on non trivial tasks. It might be more effective to showcase URExs strengths by comparing it to baselines or common tasks instead of simply claiming superiority without context. If the focus is enhancing algorithm learning performance goals as the aim of the study it could be beneficial to use more robust baseline comparisons. Provided clarity, about the goal would enhance the papers impact. 
Moreover the range of actions being evaluated is quite limited in scope at first glance The authors are worried that introducing entropy regularization might not be suitable for larger sets of possible actions Consequently an examination comparing MENT and UREx in a situation with a vast array of potential actions could shed valuable insights on whether UREx continues to be efficient, under such circumstances

After giving a response, in opposition; 
After reconsidering the situation agains I observed the conversation about action scenes that tackles my worry about the limited space, for actions. 
When it comes to addressing the challenge of starting points in research studies on reinforcement learning methods like REINFORCEMENT LEARNING and its high variability issue in results uncertainty reduction can be achieved through various techniques suggested in academic writings one example being the method proposed by Mnih and Gregor back, in 2014. 
I've updated my rating from 6 to 7 as a result of this development! I still advise the authors to work on improving their elements; however the rebuttal has effectively tackled some of my initial worries.
