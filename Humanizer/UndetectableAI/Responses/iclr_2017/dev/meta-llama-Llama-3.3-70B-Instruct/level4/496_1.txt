This document introduces a recurrent neural network structure that incorporates multiple time scales controlled by a neural network rather than being predefined at each layers level of operation within the recurrent neural network framework and demonstrates outstanding performance, on various standard datasets; the writing quality is praiseworthy overall.  
In the future we could consider expanding this approach to support RNN models.
