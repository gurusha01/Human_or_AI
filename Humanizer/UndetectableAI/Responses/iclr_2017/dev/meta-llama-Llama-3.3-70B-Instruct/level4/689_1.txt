This paper introduces a model that generates mixtures of local elements interconnected by a tensor to capture their dependencies accurately The authors use tensor decomposition based on their prior research on CNN capabilities and hierarchical Tucker decomposition to create a method, for inference However the success of this strategy relies on finding an appropriate decompositionThe authors neglect to thoroughly discuss how their method applies to the context raises concerns as they fail to define the specific space where this break down is effective and results in a minimal approximation error efficiently existing or not mentioned in their response when questioned about it in the paper is too vague and lacks clear explanation which makes the manuscript deficient, from a theoretical perspective leading to unjustified assertions being put forth. Some statements in the existing tensor research cannot be confirmed conclusively due to limitations highlighted by the authors in their analysis section.Therefore it is crucial for the authors to amend their assertions to align with the scope of their study, on a particular subset of tensors. 
Based purelyon real world findings and setting aside the limitations for a moment; the results showcased in the experiments are not robust enough to justify approval.The reliance solelyon MNIST and CIFAR 10 as benchmarks seems basic; additional thorough trials are vital.Furthermore the tests involving data seem artificial and failto capture real life circumstances effectively.Notably the paper falls short in exploring applications, beyond image data – an oversight considering the authors’ claims of broader usability. Given the gaps, in the framework provided so far in the manuscripts draft conducting further experiments is crucial to ensure its acceptance.
