My emotions are a bit conflicted regarding this submission.The use of the MPEG.  Dataset and mentions of curvature scale space give off the impression that if a task isn't valuable enough its not worth doing.It's clear that the MPEG. Dataset and standards are outdated by now making their inclusion, in a machine learning conference submission quite unexpected. When asked about it the writers explained why they decided to use that method by mentioning that their main goal was to link the abstract concepts from differential geometry of curves, with the practical functions of a convolutional neural network.. It seems reasonable since these areas are quite different. Credit should be given to the writers for trying to connect them. If we consider this task valuable and worth pursuing the authorsâ€™ strategy seems rational as they use a setup and apply deep convolutional network models to one dimensional data signals in a sensible manner. Since techniques based on invariance typically involved smoothed or filtered data representations, with nonlinear elements incorporated within them it makes sense to revisit this issue by utilizing convolutional networks. Although I don't have any objections to the acceptance of this paper due to its viewpoint that diverges from the common narrative; I am apprehensive about the narrow audience appeal at ICLR who may not have much interest, in this specific form of shape representation.
