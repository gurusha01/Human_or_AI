This paper introduces a product classification system that utilizes multiple models on a large scale consisting of three main parts. An Image CNN using the VGG 16 design structure a text CNN inspired by Kims work in 2014 and decision level fusion methods. The writers investigate fusion techniques like policies that merge data from both text and image CNN probabilities pick one CNN over the other blend predictions together or use end, to end training. Based on the results presented in the study report it is observed that the textual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) shows better performance compared to the image CNN model and combining multiple models leads to a slight enhancement in accuracy levels. Enough end to end feature level fusion doesn't perform as well as using just the text CNN model alone which was somewhat surprising. The paper is well crafted and provides real world perspectives on training extensive models; however I am leaning towards suggesting rejection due, to certain issues that I have noted; 
The research does not include information about datasets mentioned in the study report that could be crucial for reproducing the results due to the authors decision not to share the Walmart dataset, with others. 
The papers technical advancements are restricted since all the decision level fusion strategies studied have already been examined in research studies. 
The improvements in performance are not significant either. Add weight to the argument, for rejection.
