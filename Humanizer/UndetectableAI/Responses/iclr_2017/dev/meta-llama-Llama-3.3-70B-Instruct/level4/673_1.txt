The memory organization is pre established of being adaptively acquired and the test environment doesn't have a hierarchical layout; it only includes one layer, for the softmax function. 
The findings show a pattern in performance where the 10 mips performs better, than the 100 mips processor and then the 1000 mips processor follows suit. This leads to questioning whether opting for the 1 mips would be the decision. 
The estimated k mips method does not perform well as the initial technique implying that the new approach needs precise k mips to work effectively and raising questions, about its reliability.
