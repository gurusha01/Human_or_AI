While I may not have an understanding of mean field methods to thoroughly evaluate the accuracy of Equation 2 I am willing to acknowledge and use it for the sake of this review. 
When we talk about how \( x_{ i;a } \) evolves within the network in terms of presentation styles aspects it could offer some valuable understanding to certain readers.However I personally found the terminology a bit because \( x^{ * ; a } \) is described as an unchanging input vector.What actually shows the development or change of the input are the added variables \( z \) and \( y \) not \( x_{ i;a } \) itself. 
Upon reviewing the analysis provided it seems that a network could be considered trainable even if data doesn't pass through it initially. This scenario might happen when the training process adjusts the weights in a manner that allows data to start flowing within the network long as subsequent training steps don't modify the weights to impede this data flow. To elaborate on this aspect it could be helpful to define what qualifies as a "training algorithm" in this scenario.
When discussing the arguments presented in the research literature on setting up neural networks to enhance data transmission efficiency is crucial to take into account the studies conducted by Glorot & Bengio.
