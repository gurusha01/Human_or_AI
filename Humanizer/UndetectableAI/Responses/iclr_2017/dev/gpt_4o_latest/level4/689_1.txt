This study presents a model that creates mixtures of simple local patterns, with connections represented as a tensor format. The researchers use tensor decomposition based on their studies involving CNN capabilities and the hierarchical Tucker form to develop an inference method. However this strategy relies heavily on the belief that such decomposition's feasible. The paper doesn't discuss how broadly their method can be applied or specify the areas where this decomposition works well in terms of efficiency and accuracy of approximation. When asked about this issue by others the authors argue that in the age of learning such theoretical analysis is not needed.This viewpoint may be open to debate. The paper fails to provide evidence, for this assertion or highlight the drawbacks of their method.As a result the paper has deficiencies and its assertions are not completely supported. The authors of the tensor literature recognize that certain assertions lack support, in their discussion and should have been revised to state that the proposed method is limited to a specific subclass of tensors. 
Based upon observation and practical experience with the research detailed in the paper does not provide enough evidence to justify its acceptance as conclusive or valid, in its findings alone.The choice to utilize MNIST and CIFAR 10 as yardsticks for comparison is lacking; these datasets are deemed basic and do not sufficiently represent real world complexities which merit more thorough investigations.Additionally the experiments concerning missing data seem contrived and do not address scenarios that occur in reality.Furthermore the absence of experiments exploring domains beyond image data contradicts the authorsâ€™ claims that their methodology can be applied across fields.Despite their insistence otherwise the paper fails to substantiate this through testing. Ensuring the framework is fully developed and highlighting its wider relevance are key factors in securing approval, for the paper.
