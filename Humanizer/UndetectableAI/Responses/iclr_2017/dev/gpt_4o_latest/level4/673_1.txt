The memory systems hierarchy is pre established of acquired through learning processes; additionally the experimental segment does not feature a genuine hierarchical arrangement since it utilizes only one layer, for the softmax procedure.   
The findings show that a 10 mips processor outperforms a 100 mips processor, which in turn outperforms a 1000 mips processor. Does this suggest that opting for a 1 mips processor is the decision to make?   
The estimated k mips method shows performance compared to the initial approach prompting the question of why precise k mips is essential and casting doubts on the reliability of the suggested technique.
