This study presents an exploration technique designed to promote the exploration of less explored areas of rewards, in a simple manner compared to REINFORCE and Q learning algorithms. 
The research shows outcomes in the field of automating algorithm exploration through reinforcement learning techniques; however the main purpose of the paper lacks clarity regarding whether its primary aim is to improve exploration for policy gradient methods or not.The authors could strengthen their argument by testing their method on established reinforcement learning benchmarks despite the abundance of literature, on refining REINFORCE methods.The authors have chosen to concentrate on a version of REINFORCE applied to an unconventional task and have found that UREX outperforms it. If the main goal is to enhance results in algorithm learning activities by leveraging baselines that may not be as robust as desired it is important for the authors to clearly state their primary aim. 
Moreover the range of actions being examined is rather limited in scope and scale.It is pointed out on in the document that there are reservations regarding the adaptability of entropy regularization to more extensive action sets.As such a study comparing MENT and UREx within a scenario involving a range of actions could offer significant perspectives on the resilience of UREx, in such settings. 
I'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased response without seeing the original input you want me to rewrite. Please provide the text you would like me to paraphrase so I can generate a like version for you.
Following a response; 
When discussing the action options I failed to consider the impact, on action scenes. 
When it comes to the issue of starting points in REINFORCE methodology research papers propose various methods to tackle the problem of high fluctuations in outcomes A good example is the work, by Mnih and Gregor published in 2014. 
My rating has been adjusted from 6 to 7 now; nevertheless I urge the authors to enhance their work further.
