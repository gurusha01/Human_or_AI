The writers suggest an approach to intrinsic motivation based on surprise in the field of deep reinforcement learning that sets it apart from other recent methods and backs up their arguments with experiments across various types of actions – both discrete and continuous ones.The study presents two adaptations of their framework – one that overlooks the random aspects of real environmental changes and another that calculates the information acquisition rate akin, to Schmidhubers formal concepts of creativity,fundamentals and internal drive. When TRPO is combined with their technique in practice it often exceeds the performance of TRPO due to the exploration bonus it provides. However including a thorough comparison with recent intrinsic motivation methods would have added more strength to the paper.. For instance Bellemare et al.s (2016) research showcased advancements in performance in challenging Atari games like Montezumas Revenge by integrating an exploration bonus, with DQN.. Yet this study does not include Montezumas Revenge as a test benchmark.. Including comparisons would greatly improve the overall impact of the paper..
