The researchers suggested using leakier rectified units instead of binary units in Gaussian RBMs and introduced a new sampling technique for training the leakier ReLU RBM model in their studys empirical analysis section where they presented AIS derived likelihood results, for the CIFAR and SVHN datasets. 
The idea of investigating nonlinear hidden units for RBMs is intriguing but there are a few issues, with the current research;   
The authors failed to explain the theoretical validity of the proposed sampling method (Algorithm 2). Furthermore they should delve into the intricacies of the computational burden resulting from the inner loop and projection step.   
The outcomes shared in the report. Encompassing both the probability assessments and the created examples. Appear less favorable compared to the usual standards seen in Gaussian RBMs instances which leads to doubts, about the effectiveness of the training undergone by Gaussian RBMs.   
Quality generative models acquired representations frequently enhance classification task outcomes significantly in situations with limited labeling data available to train the model effectively. Moreover Gaussian RBMs are acknowledged for their performance, in tasks related to synthesizing textures given the crucial role played by blending various elements. The authors are advised to carry out experiments exploring these two aspects to bolster the robustness of their study.
