In this study (paper) we delve into the situation where various perspectives of information are represented through a neural network system that relies heavily upon probability calculations (framework). Unlike methods such as CCA which focus mainly linear relationships between variables (unlike) this method introduces complexities through non linear operations but also makes it challenging to draw conclusions or make deductions (inference). To tackle this challenge or issue effectively and efficiently (address this) the researchers utilize the VAE approach, within the framework to aid in drawing conclusions and making decisions (inference). 
The study in [Ref 1] shows that when employing a latent model for maximum likelihood estimation it results in canonical correlation directions being obtained.If we switch to a linear scenario with DNNs though it is not clearly understood at this point (from the current examination) what the resolution interprets as in relation, to canonical directions.The research paper fails to offer such an interpretation making it challenging to categorize this model as a CCA method. On the hand techniques like DCCA and DCCAE explicitly include the correlation between features, in their goals and provide clearer explanations of their results. 
Cited in a report from 2005 are the works of F.R Bach and M.I Jordan, on a probabilistic understanding of canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
Moreover the paper fails to address an amount of previous research concerning non linear multi view models. For instance there exist non linear multi view models [Ref 2, 3] expansions of frameworks incorporating shared and private spaces [Ref 4] and uses of variational and deep learning techniques [Ref 5].

The idea of combining multi modeling with VAEs shows promise and as far as I know this approach has not been previously considered which could make the proposed model quite valuable. 
The key issue at hand is how to expand VAEs to accommodate multiple perspectives in a convincing manner according to the papers findings here may not effectively address this challenge as intended for example VCCA does not seem to push boundaries in this field (and actually underperforms, in general) while VCCA private appears to lack a clear and well defined model. The dimensions \( d \) need to be adjusted by thorough exploration in this case; however there isn't a solid mechanism in place to prevent overlapping information in private and shared variables efficiently within the model structure itself.It seems arbitrary to rely solely on dropout, for addressing this concern (as highlighted in Figure 4 (version 1) where the dropout rate has a significant impact). Although fine tuning could potentially lead to improved performance (potentially explaining the FLICKER results in version 1 without altering the model) the optimization process remains complex as described. Based on experiment results VCCA private doesn't seem to push the boundaries of innovation much.Although its not expected for every new study to surpass all benchmarks the idea of extending VAEs to multiple perspectives is intriguing and deserving of deeper exploration, for better execution methods. 
One more drawback is that the rough estimate posterior is defined using one perspective instead of multiple perspectives.This decision in design lessens the effectiveness of the model, as a multi view structure since it might not work well for tasks that go beyond classification purposes.If the main goal is classification tasks the model needs to be assessed against classification techniques like feedforward neural networks. 
The illustrations in Figure 8 are nicely. Offer valuable insights into the topic at hand. In terms. The paper effectively showcases how VAEs can be combined with multi view modeling. However it falls short in two aspects; a lack of demonstration of the practicality of the suggested method and insufficient exploration of its relationship with CCA beyond their shared emphasis on multiple perspectives. To sum up. While the paper is engaging and holds value in its content there is room for improvement, through fine tuning.
