A fascinating structure that gathers mistakes and gradually rectifies them while analyzing frames, from a video sequence. 
The video created provides a visual representation of how information flows in your network making it easier to understand the concepts discussed in the paper. 
After adjusting the settings of our model to fit the KITTI dataset better, than Finn et al.s (2016) we found that our model did not perform well as Finn et al.s but outperformed Mathieu et al.s (2016) which was previously considered the best model available. 
At this moment in time it's not very clear how different the training and testing sequences are because there is no standard for video prediction benchmarks. Each author chooses their favorite datasets making it hard to compare results across studies. It's a bit disheartening that the model isn't performing well as Finn et al.s work from 2018, with the H olving motions videos.
