The report is well written and organized with results that're easy to understand. 
Since all these setups end up generating torques in the end result to be unlikely that there would be variations among them Suppose there is a recognized method for transforming one form into another (or, at least into torques). Could it be that the slight edge of control emerges only because the tracking expense is influenced by positions? 
If we were to take out the reference pose cost and focus solely on the locomotion cost instead would the outcomes stay consistent? 
If we were to try spinning a top do you think the outcomes would remain the same as before or do you have a feeling they might change? 
Although the task is interesting and holds my attention enough; its relevance, to different situations seems somewhat restricted and this limits its overall significance in a wider context. 
The video that comes with it is really well made.
