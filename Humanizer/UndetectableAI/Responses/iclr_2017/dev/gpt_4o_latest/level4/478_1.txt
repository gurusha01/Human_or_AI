It's a bit of a dilemma for me when it comes to this submission I'm reviewing here. When the mention of the MPEG­‐‐­‐­‐‐ dataset and talks about curvature scale space came up my mind immediately jumped to the saying "if its not worth doing " It's clear that the MPEG­‐‐­‐ dataset and its benchmark has been thoroughly examined and probably exhausted for quite some time now so seeing it pop up in a submission, to a ML conference is quite unexpected. When I asked the writers about why they chose to represent things that way they said they wanted to link the theory of geometry for curves, with the computational power of a convolutional neural network." I think that's a reason. I understand that these are fields of research and its commendable that the writers are trying to connect them. If we agree that this project is valuable and important to pursue steps with a Siamese network setup appears sound and their adjustment of deep convolutional network structures for 1 dimensional data signals seems well thought out too. Considering that methods based on invariance used smoothed or filtered representations along, with nonlinear elements rethinking this issue using convolutional networks sounds reasonable. Though I'm not against the idea of accepting this paper since it presents a viewpoint than whats commonly seen in the field; however my worry is that the audience, at ICLR might be too limited to fully grasp the significance of this specific form representation.
