This study addresses the task of deciphering esque symbols from pictures by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with synthetic data produced by a generative adversarial network (GAN). The GAN is trained using images and includes a "3D model" that experiences learned modifications to its images such as blurring effects and adjustments in lighting and background settings to enhance realism and diversity, in the generated data while confusing the GAN discriminator through optimized transformation parameters. After that a CNN is trained using the images generated by GANS. Then evaluated against two baseline models. One utilizing manually created features and another trained on authentic images.The new method outperforms both baselines when it comes to decoding barcode markers. 
The suggested GAN design shows promise to work in theory but I am not fully confident in supporting the paper wholeheartedly because of some shortcomings, in the assessment process. 
One important aspect that is currently absent is a comparison with a standard GAN model for reference purposes, in the research paper mentioned above. This would help in understanding the benefits of the newly proposed structured GAN better. Furthermore it would also be beneficial to analyze how well the system performs when integrating both artificially generated and real images together for the objective. 
Two sources that are important, for this project include references related to object detection utilizing simulated perspectives of three shapes.

"Examining the Transition from Real to Rendered Views in Deep Exemplar 2 2 Dimensional Detection, by Francisco Mass–∞ and collaborators at CVPR 2016."
The issue area (interpreting barcode markers on bees) is limited in scope.It would be intriguing to observe the technique used in an area,such as recognizing objects from 3 dimensional models as discussed in citation [B] allowing for direct comparisons, with previous studies. 
The text is a bit confusing, at times. For instance the beginning doesn't really lay out the points of the paper right away when you first read it. 
I have some remarks.
Fig 3 raises the query about whether these visualsre authentic representations, from a 3 dimensional design or just manipulated 2 dimensional images altered through spatial warping using homography techniques. 

Table 2 lists the loss function utilized for the DCNN.
Fig 9 (Panel a); The last four images show some artifacts present in them do you have any insights, on what might be causing them?
