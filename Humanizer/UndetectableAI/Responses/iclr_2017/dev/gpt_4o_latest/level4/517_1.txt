Sorry for the wait, in sending over this review. 
This study focuses on tackling the issue of structure estimation by approaching it as a classification challenge instead. The suggested approach takes in the covariance matrix calculated from the collected data as input and produces a binary verdict, on whether two variables are connected. The article is nicely written with defined goals and detailed explanations of the process used. 
The papers key highlight is the results showcased in the experimental section.The suggested method is simple yet surpasses non learning based approaches.This discovery is. Holds significance in the realm of structure exploration making it a meaningful addition. 
The particular setup of the learning technique is a sensible and feasible way to address this issue without bringing about any groundbreaking technical advancements. While an innovative addition like a method to data rearrangement could have presented a path, for technical creativity. Nevertheless the paper doesn't emphasize this aspect. The approach is well thought out and executed proficiently. 
The paper does a job of clearly explaining its theoretical aspects which is impressive.The results may be simple. The way the arguments are laid out is well done.Although there aren't any surprising or revolutionary ideas, in the theoretical explanations. 
To sum up the findings of the study nicely; the research suggests that graph estimation can be seen as a form of learning where data from one origin can help predict patterns in new and unfamiliar data from another source effectively enhancing its practical utility due to its stronger performance, in real world scenarios; however those exploring structure might encounter challenges related to understanding how the method works. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the Discussion and Conclusion sections. View it as a potential area for future explorationâ€”an initial solid step with opportunities, for further growth ahead.
