This study introduces a reinforcement learning system that focuses on automating the creation of network structures.In each phase of development the system chooses a type of layer and its specific settings (such as the quantity of filters). To simplify the range of choices, to the system the researchers utilize a restricted selection of design alternatives. 
Advantages; 
Here is the rewritten text; "Suggests a method, for creating neural network structures automatically."
It shows results on various datasets such, as MNIST and CIFAR A.
Areas, for improvement; 
Several initial assumptions restrict the design possibilities within the space such as predetermined sets for the quantity of convolution filters and a limit of only 2 fully connected layers, with a fixed maximum depth and dropout rates set in stone. 
The approach has been tried out in a Q learning setup but questions remain on how well it would work with bigger state action spaces. 
Overall this study presents an unique approach, to creating neural network structures; while there are a few drawbacks to consider it seems worthy of being published.
