The document describes the techniques used to teach AI agents to play the 3 D game Doom by incorporating various improvements based upon expertise in the field such as curriculum learning and attention focused strategies using zoomed in frames along with adjustments in rewards and game settings both during and, after training sessions. 
The improvements made collectively show a boost in performance as shown by the results of the competition mentioned earlier on Figure 4 illustrates how curriculum learning significantly supports training in increasingly challenging scenarios. A intriguing discovery is the lack of overfitting to the tougher classes once the agents have been trained; this could be attributed to the curriculums emphasis on both health and speed. While the authors argue in Figure 5 that the adaptive curriculum surpasses and is more consistent, than A3C method; this claim appears somewhat exaggerated based on the graph presented. They also claim that pure A4A struggles to grasp the complexities of the challenging map but do not back up this statement with relevant results or visual aids, like graphs. However Table 5 clearly demonstrates the benefits of implementing the rules after training. 
When it comes to dealing with issues to those found in 3D shooter games this study makes a valuable contribution by highlighting practical strategies to address these challenges and enhance task efficiency. However I personally feel that the study lacks an appeal as it heavily leans towards specialized knowledge thus deviating quite noticeably from a straightforward reinforcement learning scenario. While the findings might be innovative, within this context they don't strike me as particularly unexpected. 
When looking at Figure 6 here I'm having trouble drawing conclusions based on whats presented right now. My suggestion would be for the authors to either enhance the image quality or present measurable values to evaluate how clear or blurry each row or image isâ€”something concrete than just an arrow pointing, to images that are already low resolution. 
I'll rewrite your text so it sounds more human. 
"I haven't spotted the higher quality images for Figure 6 or a link, to them yet; however I believe the authors will add them in if the paper gets accepted."
