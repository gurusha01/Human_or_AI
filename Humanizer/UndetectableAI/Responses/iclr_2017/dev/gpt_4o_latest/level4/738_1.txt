Exploring the idea of using sparsity, in gradients to train LSTMs is quite fascinating.   
The paper seems unfinished because it lacks experimental validation not just relying on validation loss but also requiring comprehensive testing results and standard evaluation metrics to support the assertion that the proposed sparsity technique does not compromise performance.   
Moreover providng an explanation of how the enhancements enhance both speed and efficiency would greatly bolster the paper.
