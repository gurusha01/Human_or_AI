This paper presents a multiscale recurrent neural network that features layers operating on different time scales determined adaptively by a neural network rather than being fixed in advance. The method is smoothly incorporated into the neural network framework and delivers top notch performance on various benchmarks. The document is well written and structured in a manner. 
Can we apply this method to bidirectional RNN models well?
