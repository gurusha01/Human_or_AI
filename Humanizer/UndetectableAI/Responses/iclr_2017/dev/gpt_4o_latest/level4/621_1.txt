The paper discusses how music generation can be improved by employing a NADE model for the task of completing missing notes in a sequence of pitches with T timesteps. The authors introduce a technique where they deliberately hide some pitches and teach the model to anticipate and fill in those missing notes to follow the training principles of the NADE model. In terms of generating music samples from the model output; a typical method involves sampling that establishes an order, for organizing the generated outputs. The model analyzes the input at hand. Selects an output following a set order before integrating it into the next input, for further iterations until all outputs have been selected randomly and independently masked using the blocked Gibbs sampling approach introduced by Yao et al., 2014 where N inputs are masked and sampled repeatedly. The aim of this approach is to enhance the blending of the sampling sequence by using a N value; nevertheless a high N may result in disorganized samples because each sample is independent from the others. To counter this issue successfully and maintain coherence in the samples over time; the authors implement a decrease, in N through an annealed schedule. This progression eventually shifts towards sampling to retain the overall structure of the sample intact. The research paper showcases experiments employing both traditional measurements and human assessments to illustrate that the blocked Gibbs sampling method surpasses other sampling techniques. 
This paper is well writtenâ€”good job!
I am mostly worried that after going through the writings of Uria and Yaos works; I am a bit unsure about the perspectives this paper brings to the table when it comes to an ICLR submission specifically. If this paper had been presented at a conference focusing on music or art, in particular; it would likely be approved without much hesitation. However for consideration; the originality compared to existing research appears somewhat restricted. The NADE model without an order is widely recognized in the field of research and the approaches of blocked Gibbs sampling and annealing schedule closely adhere to Yaos proposed method. As a result this paper stands out for its focus on applying these techniques to music and discovering that Yaos method works effectively when sampling music. Although this finding is significant it may be of interest, to researchers specializing in the domain of music. If the researchers could show that these findings apply to areas like pictures (such as CIFAR or small Imagenet) or writing (such as generating documents) I might consider recommending this paper for ICLR review. Including investigations, into musical genres besides Bach chorales would enhance the papers impact.. At present time the experimental outcomes are not entirely convincing.
