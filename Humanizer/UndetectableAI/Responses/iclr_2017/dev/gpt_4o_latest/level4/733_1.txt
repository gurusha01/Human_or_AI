This study presents a method for detecting host intrusions based on anomalies using LSTM RNN to analyze system call sequences and detect unusual patterns indicative of attacks. Additionally the research compares a technique, with two standard classification models. 
The essay is nicely crafted with an expression of most ideas presented.   
It presents an use of LSTM sequential modeling, for the HIDS issue.   
The novelty overall seems restricted since the key technical elements, like LSTM RNN and the ensemble approach are already widely known in the field.   
The suggested ensemble approach needs evaluation as ensemble methods could also be utilized with the kNN and kMC benchmarks.
