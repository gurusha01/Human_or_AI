The research paper introduces a method for coaching AI characters in the video game Doom from a first person perspective (FPS). It merges the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) a reinforcement learning model with curriculum learning techniques. According to the authors assertions, in the paper; their strategy is straightforward and independent of opponent related data; furthermore achieving results by winning the Track 1 competition at the ViZDoom AI Competition 2016 with a substantial lead. The article also presents the use of adaptive curriculum training and guidelines after training to improve effectiveness and consistency. 
Decision approved.
The research paper is compelling. Showcases impressive real world outcomes that make a valuable contribution to the realm of reinforcement learning in complex 3D environments where observation is limited. The main factors leading to approval include the combination of curriculum learning with A3C to tackle challenges like scarce rewards and competitive scenarios and the proven effectiveness of the new approach in outperform ing other methods in a challenging comparison test by achieving a 35% higher score, than its closest competitor. 
Here are some points to consider; 
The paper discusses the task of teaching AI agents in complex 3 dimensional environments where rewards are scarce and long term relationships pose challenges for using reinforcement learning directly effective ly. Implement curriculum learning to gradually advance the complexity of tasks is justified and consistent, with existing research. 
   
The researchers thoroughly explain their methods in the paper by detailing the network structure used well as the training process and methods for shaping rewards. They carefully assess their findings through tests like ablation studies and internal competitions to validate the papers assertions. Moreover the flexible curriculum. Guidelines implemented after training contribute, to fortifying the models resilience. 
The new approach showed excellent performance results. Secured a significant victory in the ViDOOM AI Competition Track 1 compared to others, in the field of study. 
Recommendations, for Enhancing; 
Can you please elaborate more on the curriculum? It would be helpful to understand how the probability distribution changes based on performance over time in an algorithmic representation, for better clarity. 
   
Track 1 is the focus of the paper but it doesn't delve into why the proposed method wasn't utilized for Track 1 (unfamiliar maps). Adding a conversation about the obstacles and possible adjustments, for Track 1 would enhance the papers depth. 
The paper suggests that the framework can be used for closed source games but would be more convincing with some examples or tests, on first person shooter games to show its versatility. 
Understanding Computational Expenses; The process of training requires 255 processes and several GPUs which might not be practical for all researchers to undertake at this scale of computational infrastructure capacity limitation, for various forms of optimization efficiency discussions would be beneficial. 
Queries, for the Writers; 
How does the adaptive curriculum manage situations when the agents performance varies greatly over time and is there a way to avoid changes, in the level of task complexity? 
Is it possible to expand the suggested structure to accommodate maps like in Track 3)? If not feasible as is, at stage of development) what adjustments would need to be made for this purpose? 
How does the models success measure up against that of players when considering a more extensive set of data points that go beyond just the short human AI game discussed earlier? 
To sum up the paper provides an insight, into reinforcement learning within intricate 3 dimensional settings and showcases top notch performance in a competitive context. Some slight clarifications and further discussion would enhance the papers strength more.
