Ways to enhance your work
Scalability and Efficiency Concerns; Even though the approach works well in practice the computational expense (requiring 10 GPUs over 10 days, per dataset) poses a challenge. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore ways to alleviate this cost by utilizing processing or implementing more streamlined exploration methods. 
The paper should include a comparison with recent Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods that utilize reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms to better explain its contributions, in context. 
Hyperparameter Sensitivity Concerns; The paper notes that consistent hyperparameters were applied across all explorations but conducting an assessment of how the outcomes are influenced by these hyperparameters could bolster the assertions made. 
State and action space design is crucial when it comes to discretization choices in the context of this research paper being discussed by the authors. They explain their reasoning behind it. Exploring the trade offs involved in such discretization like granularity, versus convergence speed would add significant value to the discussion. 
Questions to Ask the Writers 
Exploring the balance between exploration and exploitation in Meta QNN how much does the performance depend on the adjustment schedule of epsilon (Îµ)? Could using exploration strategies like softmax action selection lead, to better convergence? 
Transfer Learning Question; The study discusses how architectures identified in perform when applied to different tasks. But how does their performance stack up against architectures designed specifically for those tasks? 
Are there chances that certain limitations like restricting connected layers to only two might unintentionally restrict the use of architectures that could perform exceptionally well due to speed up convergence? 
Ultimately On the paper offers a thoroughly executed and significant contribution, to the automated design of neural networks Sticking to the recommendations mentioned earlier could enhance its clarity and practicality even more.
