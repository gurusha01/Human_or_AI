Paper Review of "Hierarchical Memory Networks, with Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)"
Overview of Contributions 
The article presents a hierarchical memory network (HMNs) which integrates Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) enabling efficient memory access in neural networks on a large scale The innovative HMNs tackle the challenges of soft attention (inefficient computation for extensive memory storage capacity) and hard attention (instability, during training) by blending the benefits of both methods The main highlights consist of; 
A memory system that sorts memory into categories to allow for access to information, without using too much memory capacity. 
Utilizing MIPS for fetching memory segments to facilitate scalable training and inference processes. 
An analysis conducted on the SimpleQuestions dataset showed that precise K MIPS enhances accuracy compared to attention methods and that approximate K MIPS offers notable speed enhancements with reasonable compromises, in performance quality. 
Exploring clustering based K MIPS techniques that show superior performance compared to other approximations such, as hashing and tree based methods when training HMNs.

Tips, for Enhancement 
The paper shows a foundation; here are some ideas to make it even better; 
The paper does not provide a comparison of its findings with the methods utilized in the SimpleQuestions dataset, such as models employing heuristics based on keywords like other research papers do which could offer better insights, into the real world applicability of HMNs. 

Expanding Its Usefulness. Although emphasizing fact based question answering is important in itself s howing how HMNs can be applied to tasks, like dialogue systems or knowledge based reasoning would give the paper more influence. 
Scalability for Larger Datasets; The tests were only conducted using the SimpleQuestions dataset so testing the model with datasets, like FB1B or FB3B would offer more robust evidence of its scalability. 
Questions to Ask the Writers
How does the suggested HM network stack up against the models utilizing keyword based rules to sift through information in both accuracy and scalability performance metrics? 
Have you thought about how adjusting the memory representation in time while training could affect things? If yes... What difficulties do you anticipate when trying to incorporate K MIPS? 
Is it possible to expand the suggested HM model to manage tasks that involve step reasoning or tasks that demand intricate memory interactions? 
In summary this research adds insights to the realm of memory enhanced neural networks by tackling scalability obstacles with a fresh and strongly backed method. By making some tweaks and conducting tests it could possibly establish a new standard, for scalable memory networks.
