Reflection, on the Report 
  
The study delves into the practical aspects of convolutional networks inductive bias by examining their capacity to capture relationships among input regions specifically.The authors propose the idea of separation rank as a metric for the intensity of correlations and investigate convolution circuits to illustrate that deep networks can attain significantly high separation ranks for specific input divisions compared to shallow networks, with linear separation ranks.The research also highlights the influence of pooling geometry in selecting preferred input partitions and controlling the networks inductive bias. Real world tests support the conclusions by demonstrating the varying effectiveness of different pooling shapes on tasks with particular correlation patterns. The study sheds light on how the depth of convolution networks can be valuable and presents a method, for customizing biases for specific tasks.
