This study explores how different ways of defining actions affect the learning process when using reinforcement learning (DeepRL) for tasks involving dynamic movement like walking or running in robots or computer simulations of humanoids, with articulated joints on a flat surface mimicking natural movements. The study shows that using higher level ways to describe actions (such as PD and Vel) along with feedback can really enhance how quickly one learns new tasks and the overall quality of movements when compared to basic torque based control methods. Some important findings highlighted in the research are; (1). A sophisticated DeepRL model for mimicking movements. (2). A thorough assessment of four actuation models based on various factors. (3). An innovative method that combines policy learning with optimizing actuators, for muscle models. The project is driven by a motivation as it delves into a lesser explored area of reinforcement learning, within biomechanical systems and offers valuable understandings on the physical aspect of control. 
Sure thing! Here is the paraphrased text; Verdict received. Approval granted.
The research paper should be accepted as it provides a perspective in investigating action parameterization in DeepRL and offers valuable insights into motion control in biomechanical systems through thorough experimentation and practical applications.The scientific rigor of the results and the potential for advancing research, in this field make it a compelling contribution. 
Backing up your points
The paper focuses on a gap in existing research by examining the effects of action parameterization in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL). It stands out for its approach of studying biomechanically inspired models like MTUs in addition to conventional methods, which offers valuable insights, for progressing motion control studies. 
   
The experiments show a scientific approach by including various characters like humans (biped) dogs and raptors with different movements and assessing their learning speeds reliability levels and motion quality while considering how often they are asked questions for information retrieval purposes.The outcomes are backed up by observational evidence and the writers offer thorough breakdowns of the compromises involved in using different settings, for the experiments. 
The results of this study go beyond walking and could impact the development of reinforcement learning systems in various fields like robotics and animation by understanding how actions are defined in different contexts to enhance actuation mechanics and control strategies through collaborative design, for future investigations. 
Ways to Enhance 
Understanding MTÜ Optimization Clearly; Even though the suggested method for optimizing actuators enhances MTÜ efficiency according to the studys findings; it is noted that there could be room for optimization of the parameters involved in the process. Expanding on the constraints of the optimization procedure and suggesting enhancements such, as task optimization would add depth to the conversation. 
The study focuses on flat articulated shapes and does not explore 3 dimensional movement or other control tasks extensively enough to maximize the papers significance. 
The authors suggest that the reward function does not show a bias, towards PD and Vel models inherently; however; they could strengthen this argument by including reward functions or conducting ablation studies to support their claim. 
The research paper makes mention of supplementary materials such as videos and figures to aid understanding; however it would be more reader friendly to incorporate important visual aids like comparisons of motion quality directly into the main paper for better accessibility, to readers. 
Questions to Ask the Writers 
How much do the outcomes change based the adjustments in hyperparameters, like the structure of networks and learning rates? Could these elements have an impact certain ways action parameters are set up? 
The MTUs show movements and forces, in their actions, which raises the question of whether this characteristic could be utilized for tasks that demand precise control or energy conservation effectiveness and if there are particular scenarios where MTUs could excel over other parameterizations. 
How do you see expanding the suggested framework to incorporate 4 movement or practical applications, in real life robots and what difficulties do you foresee with such expansions? 
This study significantly adds value to the Deep Reinforcement Learning and motion control domain; I am excited to see how its discoveries spark exploration, in the future.
