This research introduces a speech recognition system from beginning to end merging a ConvNet based acoustic model with a decoding approach based on graphs. It presents an Automatic Segmentation Criterion (ASD) which removes the requirement, for phoneme force alignment during training. The study shows that ASD is more straightforward and computationally efficient compared to the used Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion while maintaining similar accuracy levels. The model is tested on the LibriSpeech dataset. Shows good word error rates with MFCC features (7 0 percent) while also yielding positive outcomes, with power spectrum (nine point four percent) and raw waveform (ten point one percent). The research highlights the design of the system and how it demands less computing power compared to RNN based models while offering versatility in input feature selection.

Practical Implication; The systems computational complexity when compared to RNN based methods along with its capability to process raw waveform input makes it very attractive for practical use, in real world scenarios. 
Tips, for Enhancing Your Work
The ASR criterions clarity is crucial; however its mathematical representation and distinctions from CTC should be elucidated in an intuitive manner for better comprehension. A visual juxtaposition of graphs (such, as Figures 2 and 3) could be seamlessly incorporated into the conversation to enhance understanding. 
Decoder Information; The article discusses a beam search decoder without delving into its performance trade offs when matched against more advanced decoders, in enough depth to back up the assertions of simplicity and effectiveness. 
The outcomes from using raw waveform data show promise; however the paper should address why this type of feature is not as advanced as MFCC and power spectrum features.It would be beneficial to offer insights into enhancements or future paths, for utilizing raw waveform input. 
The paper points out that the new system requires training data than Deep Speech models do but it would be beneficial to explore how the system would perform with larger datasets and if the performance gap could be narrowed down. 
Queries, for the Writers.
How well does the ASO standard hold up when applied to word pools or different languages with more intricate sound patterns? 
Could the suggested system see improvement by incorporating sophisticated language models or decoding techniques and how might this affect computational performance?
