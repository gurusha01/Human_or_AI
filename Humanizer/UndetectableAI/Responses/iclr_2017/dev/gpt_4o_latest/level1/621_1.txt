The research discusses COCONET which's a type of convolutional neural network belonging to the NADE family of generative models and examines its use in creating polyphonic music through a method called blocked Gibbs sampling technique. The authors suggest that this approach better captures the iterative nature of human music composition in comparison to more traditional sequential sampling methods. They argue that employing blocked Gibbs sampling leads to an enhancement in the quality of generated samples compared to ancestral sampling methods even, with approximate techniques. The study presents evidence supporting the idea that this enhancement's a result of certain conditional distributions not being accurately represented in ancestral sampling procedures. The authors showcase how well their method works by conducting experiments, on creating music without constraints and restoring damaged Bach chorales. 
Outcome to be approved.
The decision was made primarily because the paper tackles an overlooked issue, in music creation through a fresh approach inspired by how humans compose music and also because the test outcomes effectively show the effectiveness of the new blocked Gibbs sampling technique compared to conventional methods. 
Here are some points that back up the argument; 
The paper addresses an important issue in music creation â€“ how to accurately replicate the nonlinear and iterative aspects of human composition more effectively using blocked Gibbs sampling as a method similar to human creativity is well supported by references to earlier research in generative modeling such, as NADE and Yao et al., 2014. 
The experimental findings are strong. Backed by scientific rigor in this research study The authors present both qualitative and quantitative proof. For example through the restoration of damaged Bach chorales. To showcase the efficacy of their approach The visual representations and heatmaps play a key role in elucidating the step, by step improvement process
The paper presents a perspective by merging blocked Gibbs sampling with convolutional neural networks, within the NADE family to enhance music generation techniques significantly while showcasing its practical applicability through versatile methods. 
Here are some ways to enhance; 
The paper is well written overall; however the description of implementing blocked Gibbs sampling could use elaboration for better understanding by readers who are new, to the technique. 
The paper mainly discusses the differences between blocked Gibbs sampling and ancestral sampling suggesting that including comparisons, with advanced music generation models would further support its superiority claims. 
Ablation Studies Recommendation; It would be beneficial to conduct ablation studies that separate and analyze the impacts of elements of the model such, as comparing the convolutional architecture to the sampling procedure. 
Queries, for the Writers; 
How well does the model work with types of data sets or music genres apart, from Bach chorales? Can the approach be applied to a range of musical styles effectively? 
Can you please give me information, about how efficient the blocked Gibbs sampling method is when compared to ancestral sampling? 
How does the model react to hyperparameter settings when using the blocked Gibbs sampling method? 
Overall this paper adds value to the music generation field and fits well with the conference objectives; a few tweaks and more comparisons could enhance its impact further.
