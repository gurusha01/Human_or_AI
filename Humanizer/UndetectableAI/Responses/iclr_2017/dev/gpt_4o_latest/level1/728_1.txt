Discussion, on the Document

The research paper presents the Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) a new framework created to examine trained reinforcement learning (RL) policies through the use of spatiotemporal abstractions. SAMDP merges the benefits of Semi Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs). Aggregated MDP (AMDP) simplifying policy analysis by reducing state space complexity and planning duration. The authors outline an approach, for developing SAMDP models, which involves selecting features clustering spatiotemporally identifying skills making inferences and choosing models. The study showcases the effectiveness of SAMDP by conducting experiments on a gridworld scenario and difficult Atari2600 games that were tackled using Deep Q Networks (DQN). Specifically highlighted are the benefits of the model in overseeing policies performance enhancements through a unique "emergency exit" feature and offering understandable explanations of policy actions taken. The research is thoughtfully executed as it tackles the task of comprehending and evaluating policies, within intricate reinforcement learning settings. 
Decision approved.
The research paper adds insights to the realm of Reinforcement Learning by introducing a fresh and applicable approach, to policy evaluation backed by thorough experiments and solid theoretical foundations. 
The SAMDP model offers a perspective by blending spatial and temporal abstractions to meet the demand for understandable policy analysis, within the RL community. 
Scientific Thoroughness; The method used is strong and well structured with descriptions of how SAMDP is built and evaluated along, with experimental outcomes that support the arguments made. 
Reasons to Support 
The paper is positioned within the existing literature by expanding on familiar ideas, like SMDPs and AMDPs and acknowledging their constraints effectively through SAMDP introduction is persuasive. Especially when examining deep neural network trained policy analyses where interpretability poses a known difficulty. 
The practical testing phase confirms the effectiveness of the model in simplifying policy analysis and offering valuable insights through experiments conducted on gridworld and Atari2600 games.The inclusion of assessment standards, like VMSE (Variable Mean Squared Error) entropy measurements and correlation metrics bolsters the scientific reliability of the outcomes. 
The functionality of the SAMDP in shared autonomy systems is exemplified by the "Eject Button," underscoring its use and potential, for real world scenarios. 
Ways to Enhance Your Work
The paper discusses the use of a customized K means algorithm for clustering methods in models but suggests that exploring advanced techniques, like spectral clustering could improve model quality further with more detailed comparisons or insights provided by the authors. 
The paper recognizes that there may be differences, in how SAMDP modelsre created because of the randomness involved in clustering and feature extraction processes suggesting that future research could explore ways to achieve consistency across various iterations. 
Scalability is an aspect that the paper could explore further by delving into the computational scalability of SAMDP construction in addressing larger scale RL challenges in settings, with continuous state and action spaces. 
Feature Representation; Although it makes sense to utilize t SNE for feature extraction as mentioned in the text above and recommended in the conversation section of the paper; it would be beneficial for the authors to investigate methods of dimensionality reduction that take into consideration temporal relationships explicitly.
