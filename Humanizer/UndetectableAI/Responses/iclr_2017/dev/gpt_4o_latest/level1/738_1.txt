Article Review
The research paper explores how sparsity focused optimization can be used in training LSTM based RNN models. An area that hasn't received much attention compared to CNN models.The authors highlight the presence of sparsity, in the gradients during propagation and suggest a straightforward method called "sparsified SGD" to introduce extra sparsity. The results from the experiment show that the new approach can achieve than 80 percent sparsity in linear gate gradients without negatively impacting the models performance.This results in cutting down multiply and add (MAC) operations by over 50 percent during training.The research paper highlights its contributions as a stride towards enhancing energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM based RNN models which could have implications, for hardware acceleration. 
Outcome of the decision is approval.
The research paper stands out for its motivation and significant contribution to the realm of optimizing LSTM based RNN models with a focus on sparsity techniques. It is particularly commendable for two reasons; Firstly the originality in investigating sparsity within LSTM gradient training methods â€“ an area that has received less attention than CNN frameworks. Secondly the robust validation through experiments, across different applications and datasets lends solid support to the findings. The suggested approach is straightforward yet impactful. The results are backed by thorough scientific rigor. 
Arguments, in favor.
Relevance and Originality of the Issue; The study tackles a gap in existing research by expanding sparse optimization methods to LSTM based RNN models, which is a unique approach that stems from the imbalanced distribution of gate activations, in backward propagation gradients.
