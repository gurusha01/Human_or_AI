This article discusses the challenge of learning from unlabeled (PU) data and introduces two classification methods designed to handle noise in positive labels and perform well in high dimensional datasets. The authors expand upon theoretical research, in PU learning that has faced difficulties when applied to noisy and high dimensional scenarios. Their main innovations involve incorporating modeling of label noise and utilizing univariate transformations based on discriminative classifiers. One important finding is the confirmation that these variable transformations maintain the original class information accurately for easier estimations within the single variable context and avoiding the difficulties of kernel density estimation in datasets with many dimensions.While offering both unstructured versions of their techniques the authors present their research as a move towards effective and reliable classification, in real world scenarios. 
Advantages; 
The paper focuses on an aspect of PU learning by addressing the challenges of handling noise and scaling to high dimensional data, in real world scenarios—a critical gap that the proposed methods aim to bridge with the potential to advance current practices and gain widespread acceptance. 
The solid theoretical basis lies in demonstrating how the univariate transformations maintain the class distribution—a key factor that supports the viability of the suggested method, for dealing with complex datasets. 
This paper focuses moreon practicality compared to studies which were largely theoretical, in nature.It suggests algorithms that can actually be put into practice and scaled up effectively. 
The paper effectively outlines its contributions which include the representation of label inaccuracies and the innovative application of single variable transformations. 
Areas of improvement; 
The paper asserts its robustness and effectiveness without providing experimental results in the abstract section of the text.. It remains unclear how the suggested methods fare quantitatively against real world datasets when compared to established PU learning algorithms. 
The abstract lacks clarity, on how the suggested methods distinguish themselves from or enhance PU learning approaches, which could be improved by delving deeper into related work discussions. 
The abstract should be clearer to make it easier for a wider audience to understand by explaining terms like "univariate transforms" and "discriminative classifiers”, in simpler language. 
Cons of supporting the idea; 
Sorry,. I can't do that.
The document discusses an overlooked issue, in the field of PU learning supported by a robust theoretical framework. 
The suggested approaches are realistic and adaptable, in tackling issues related to disturbances and extensive data dimensions. 
I'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the paraphrased text without the actual content that needs to be rewritten. Could you please provide the text that you would like me to paraphrase?
The detailed analysis and comparison, with research are lacking in the abstract.
The paper could be clearer and more reader friendly, to those who may not have an understanding of the technical aspects of PU learning. 
Suggestion; 
In general; this paper provides an addition to PU learning by focusing on dealing with noise resilience and scalability issues. Yet; the insufficient presentation of experimental findings and exploration of relevant studies hinders its direct influence. I suggest accepting it with modifications; on the condition that the authors offer a more thorough assessment and clearer explanation, in the complete paper.
