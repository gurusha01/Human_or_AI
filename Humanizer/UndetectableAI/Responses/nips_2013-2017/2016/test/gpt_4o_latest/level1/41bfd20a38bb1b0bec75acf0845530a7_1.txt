This research paper presents an approach known as Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) which aims to shape Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)' structures by utilizing group Lasso regularization technique. SSL focuses on structural elements of DNN such as filters and channels to enhance efficiency and accuracy in classification tasks. The study showcases the capability of SSL in adjusting DNN architectures during training process leading to notable performance enhancements (e.g., 5x faster on CPU and 3x faster on GPU, for AlexNet) without compromising accuracy levels. For example​​​​​ a 20 layer ResNet is reduced to 18 layers using SSL which enhances accuracy from 91​​​​​.25 % to 92​​​​​.60 % on CIFAR. 10. The study also points out that SSL surpasses structured sparsity techniques by guaranteeing memory access patterns that are friendly for hardware thus making it more feasible, for real world implementation.
Areas of expertise; 
The document outlines a mathematical explanation of SSL with theoretical backing and practical results displayed effectively in its application of group Lasso for structured sparsity, across different DNN elements. 
The results of the experiments are quite impressive as they demonstrate improvements in speed and accuracy across various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR 10 and ImageNet and different architectures like LeNet, ResNet and AlexNet. A comparison, with methods that do not use structured sparsity clearly shows the benefits of SSL. 
The papers emphasis on sparsity that is conducive to hardware usage tackles a challenge when implementing extensive DNN models on devices with limited resources—a factor that is of significant importance, to both the academic and industrial sectors. 
The paper is nicely laid out with explanations of how the research was done and what the results were, like.Findings are clearly shown through figures and tables. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper focuses heavily on the advantages of SSL. Fails to address its drawbacks adequately like the increased computational load when using group Lasso in training or the adaptability of SSL, for highly complex networks. 
The paper could improve by extending its comparison beyond SSL to include modern model compression techniques, like neural architecture search or quantization instead of just focusing on non unstructured sparsity methods and low rank approximation. 
The authors have shared a source code. Could enhance reproducibility by including additional information on hyperparameter settings and training procedures, in the paper. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article discusses an issue, with deploying deep neural networks and suggests an innovative and efficient resolution. 
The findings are meaningful. Show notable enhancements compared to current approaches. 
The methodology is solid. Can be applied to different types of structures and tasks. 
Reasons to oppose approval; 
The papers stance is somewhat weakened by the absence of an in depth examination of constraints and an extensive evaluation in comparison, to other compression methods. 
The full extent of the expenses involved in implementing SSL during training has not been adequately examined. 
Suggestion; 
This paper significantly advances the study of model compression and structured sparsity in neural networks (DNN). It offers a blend of depth and practical applicability backed by substantial experimental findings that enhance its significance at the conference venue suggested for acceptance, with slight revisions to rectify the identified shortcomings.
