In this research paper introduces a method for optimization that substitutes custom made algorithms with trained optimizers built using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The authors approach designing optimization algorithms as a learning challenge which allows the optimizer to leverage characteristics of each problem. The trained optimizers perform better than techniques such, as SGD and RMSprop in tasks they are tailored for and demonstrate good performance in similar tasks too. The study shows how well this method works in areas like quadratic optimization and training neural networks using MNIST and CIFAR 10 datasets; also in creating neural art styles effectively transferring between them with ease. The writers emphasize the possibility of transfer learning by proving that the optimized skills can be applied to tasks, with structures and data sets regardless of their complexity levels. 
Advantages; 
The research paper brings an angle, to optimization by utilizing meta learning to create optimizers instead of relying on conventional manual approaches.The decision to use LSTMs for optimizing parameters is both creative and well reasoned. 
"Technical Soundness; The methodology is well crafted with mathematical explanations and reasoning behind them. Utilizing backpropagation through time ( BPT ) for optimizing training is suitable, for the given problem scenario." 
The authors thoroughly test their method across tasks such, as synthetic quadratic functions and neural network training including neural art creation.They conduct experiments that compare their approach with the latest optimizers and analyze its generalizability. 
The paper effectively shows that the acquired optimizers perform across different tasks and datasets beyond their initial training scopeâ€”a significant advancement, in the realms of meta learning and optimization. 
The paper is nicely. Structured with, in depth explanations of the methodology and experiments clearly laid out for easy understanding through well presented figures and results. 
Areas needing improvement; 
The method works effectively for tasks but its capability to handle large scale challenges like modern deep learning models with millions of parameters needs further examination, for scalability concerns and computational efficiency. 
Training the optimizers typically focuses heavily on tasks, like creating artwork in a particular style using neural networks rather than a wide range of tasks. Although they can generalize to tasks successfully it remains uncertain how effective the method would be when applied to completely different tasks. 
The paper contrasts its method with optimizers but does not assess it against other meta learning strategies for optimization, like reinforcement learning or hyperparameter tuning methods. 
Interpretation is challenging since the update rules rely heavily upon LSTMs, than conventional optimization methods; delving deeper into the dynamics would improve the papers quality. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The article examines a core issue, in the field of machine learning and optimization using an effectively implemented method. 
The findings are quite impressive as they show enhancements compared to usual optimizers and a remarkable ability to generalize well across different scenarios. 
The research is expected to spark studies, in meta learning and optimization that is learned through experience and practice. 
Reasons, to Decline; 
The ability of the method to handle challenges, on a larger scale is still questionable. 
The absence of references, to meta learning driven optimization techniques hinders the contextual understanding of the innovations impact.
