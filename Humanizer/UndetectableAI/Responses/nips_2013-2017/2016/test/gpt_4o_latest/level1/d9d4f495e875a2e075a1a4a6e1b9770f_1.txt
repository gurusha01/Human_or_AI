This research paper introduces a video prediction model that forecasts the results of real world physical interactions by predicting pixel motion based on specific actions taken in the videos. The authors introduce three modules for motion prediction—Dynamic Neural Advection (DNA) Convolutional DNA (CDNA) and Spatial Transformer Predictors (STP)—which utilize information from past frames to anticipate future frames. By emphasizing motion rather than object details the model showcases its ability to predict outcomes involving unfamiliar objects and make predictions, over extended periods. The research paper presents a collection of 59k robot interactions to demonstrate how well the model anticipates video sequences based on robot actions.The experimental findings show that the new models surpass cutting edge techniques in terms of quality and quantity as seen in metrics, like PSNR and SSIM. 
Advantages; 
The research paper tackles a hurdle in predicting videos by introducing innovative models that focus on motion and can adapt to new objects effectively.This unique approach of incorporating action based conditioning along, with pixel motion prediction pushes the boundaries of video prediction technology. 
The models in the paper are well justified. Include thorough explanations of the DNA, CDNA and STPO architectures and how they work. The use of masks, for object movement is especially interesting because it adds an element of interpretability and focuses more clearly Object representation. 
The creation of a dataset for robotic pushing is a significant addition to the field as it allows for more research into predicting actions, in videos effectively. 
The researchers carried out experiments to test their models against previous methods and variations in different datasets like robotic pushing and Human 36 million (Human36m). The results remained consistent and reliable, across datasets showcasing the adaptability of the model. 
The paper is nicely. Provides clear descriptions of the methods used in the research as well as details, about the datasets and experiments conducted for reproducibility purposes. 
Areas that could be improved upon; 
The authors mention that uncertainty grows with time and appears as a blur but do not delve into using methods to model uncertainty explicitly for better long term predictions. 
The main emphasis of the paper is on predicting actions based on conditions. It may not be very applicable to tasks that do not involve explicit actions as inputs.However the experiments conducted on Human 36 M dataset somewhat tackle this issue.More research, on predicting video outcomes without involving specific actions would enhance the value of the study. 
The paper could improve by providing a thorough analysis of recent adversarial and probabilistic approaches, like generative adversarial networks (GANs). It should delve deeper into how these methods compare to the ones mentioned in the paper. 
Reasons to consider; 
The paper presents an efficient method for predicting videos with compelling experimental findings and a substantial addition, to the dataset. 
The suggested models are easy to understand and process quickly while also performing well with objects and making predictions over long distances. 
The study focuses on an issue in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence that could be useful in tasks related to planning strategies and decision making processes as well, as reinforcement learning applications. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The methods effectiveness for tasks needing long term predictions is restricted due, to the absence of clear uncertainty modeling. 
The emphasis, on prediction based on actions could limit the extent of the impact. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted as it brings contributions, to video prediction with action conditioning and dataset creation while maintaining experimental rigor at the conference venue. Moving forward in this area of research should involve focusing on modeling uncertainty and expanding the applicability of these findings to a range of video prediction tasks.
