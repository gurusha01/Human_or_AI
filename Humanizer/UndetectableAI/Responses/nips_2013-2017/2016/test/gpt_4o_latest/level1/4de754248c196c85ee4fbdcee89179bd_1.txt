The study introduces a strategy for monitoring household appliances energy disaggregation by utilizing additive factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). The researchers suggest an computationally efficient technique that incorporates semidefinite programming (SDP) randomized rounding methods and an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). A key aspect of their work involves replacing the programming relaxation from previous research, by Kolter and Jaakkola in 2012 with a more precise SDP relaxation suited for large scale integer programming challenges. The writers also present an ADMM version customized for the block like structure of the SDP that allows scalability for datasets with millions of variables. Results from experiments on real world datasets show that the suggested approach outperforms current algorithms by achieving reduced disaggregation errors and improved precision and recall, in identifying appliance states. 
Advantages
The paper is technically sound as it includes thorough explanations of the suggested SDP relaxation and ADMM based solver methods. Additionally the randomized rounding technique is well justified. Is based on existing strategies like the one in Park and Boyds work, from 2015. 
The new technique tackles a constraint in current FHMM based methods by allowing analysis of extensive datasetsâ€”an important step forward for using energy disaggregation, in real world scenarios. 
Experimental Validation Section; The researchers conducted experiments using both artificial and actual data sets to show consistent enhancements compared to other approaches (such as Kolter and Jaakkola in 2012 and Zhong et al., 2014). By incorporating assessment criteria, like normalized disaggregation error and precision recall metrics strengthens the validity of their findings. 
The technique could be used in other scenarios apart from energy breakdown analysis;, for instance in tackling different FHMM inference issues or handling extensive integer quadratic programming tasks. 
Areas, for improvement
The paper provides technical content; however it could use clearer explanations in the derivation of the SDP relaxation and the ADMM updates for better understanding, by non expert readers due its dense nature and complex mathematical details. 
The computational workload is quite high despite the methods scalability; real world experiments took 14 hours which exceeds the time taken by other methods considerably. The writers admit to this drawback. Propose that an updated C++ version could potentially enhance effectiveness but this proposition is still uncertain. 
The method shows performance on the REDDD dataset but its applicability to other real world energy datasets, with varying characteristics has not been investigated. 
In terms of comparisons the current methods only consider a number of algorithms, which is quite restrictive in assessing the situation thoroughly; incorporating newer deep learning techniques, like convolutional or recurrent neural networks could offer a more holistic evaluation. 
Reasons to consider accepting the proposal.
The research paper discusses a scalability problem, in FHMM based energy disaggregation and pushes the boundaries of current knowledge in the field. 
The suggested approach shows a level of technical innovation backed by both theoretical principles and real world data. 
The research carries weight in the realm of solving big optimization challenges and holds relevance for a diverse group of people. 
Reasons to Object to Approval
The presentation could use some improvement in terms of clarity for those readers who are not so familiar, with SDP and ADMM. 
The methods computational efficiency is an issue, for real world use despite outperforming SDP solvers in this regard. 
The assessment only focuses on one dataset from the real world and that might impact its overall applicability and relevance, in broader contexts. 
Suggestion
In terms this document adds a notable value to the domain of energy breakdown and wide ranging optimization efforts.Although there are some reservations about how clear and computationally efficient it's the positives overshadow the negatives.I suggest agreeing to it long as the writers tackle the clarity concerns and delve into possible expansions, for enhancing runtime in upcoming studies.
