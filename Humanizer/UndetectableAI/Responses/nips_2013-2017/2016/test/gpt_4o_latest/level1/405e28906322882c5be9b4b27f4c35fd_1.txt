The study delves into examining the changing sense of disappointment in scenarios involving options (like a game of chance with different levers to pull) as well as situations where experts offer advice in environments with unpredictable patterns over time and involving randomness that can vary significantly from one occurrence to another. A new factor called Ψ is introduced to gauge the amount of variation in losses experienced over a given number of rounds T. The researchers delve into how Ψ interacts with other factors like Δ (the frequency of changes in distributions of outcomes over time) and W (the total range of differences, between these distributions) offering a detailed exploration of how much regret one might experience in both scenarios. When decisions are made based on partial information and when all information is available. One important discovery is that in the bandit scenario the minimum levels of regret increase as T increases if Λ,Gamma and V remain constant. In contrast in the full information scenario consistent regret can be reached given circumstances. The study also suggests strategies with high and low boundaries and presents a parameter free strategy, for real world applications. 
Advantages; 
The addition of Λ as a factor to describe changes, in situations is a noteworthy innovation that joins adversarial and uncertain scenarios in a cohesive manner. 
The paper provides upper and lower limits for regret in bandit and full information scenarios with a thorough grasp of the issue, at hand The corresponding limits bolster the reliability of the findings. 
The paper offers an examination by studying the relationships among Λ, Γ V and T to present a holistic perspective on the landscape of regret that is beneficial, for furthering the field. 
The addition of a parameter algorithm addresses real world application concerns and enhances the practical relevance of the work. 
Results Clarity; The findings are neatly presented with a differentiation between the bandit and full information scenarios.The addition of a summary table, in the appendix aids readers understanding. 
Areas that need improvement; 
The papers theoretical points are solid. May be difficult for those not well versed in the subject due, to its complexity; enhancing clarity by simplifying explanations or offering more intuitive insights could make it more reader friendly. 
The paper could benefit from including real world data to support the suggested algorithms better and enhance the significance of the research despite having strong theoretical foundations. 
The feasibility of assumptions in applications is a key consideration for certain algorithms that rely on parameters such as Λ and Γ that may not be readily accessible, in real world settings all the time. Although the parameter free algorithm attempts to alleviate this issue to some extent its effectiveness compared to parameter algorithms remains unexplored.
The paper acknowledges research but could benefit from a more thorough comparison that clearly outlines the improvements made over current methods. 
Suggestion; 
The reviewers suggest accepting the paper with some revisions as it offers a valuable theoretical insight into dynamic regret, in changing environments by introducing a new parameter and establishing precise boundaries. However the authors are advised to enhance the clarity of their explanation and incorporate results to substantiate their theoretical conclusions. Moreover a deeper exploration of the ramifications and constraints of their assumptions could strengthen the papers significance.  
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
New and significant theoretical advancements that make a difference. 
After conducting an examination of the limitations of regret we found that the upper and lower limits align closely providing a comprehensive evaluation overall. 
Introducing a parameter algorithm adds practical significance, to the equation. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
There is a need, for verification. 
The information is presented in a way that might make it hard for some readers to access. 
There is not talk, about the real world difficulties faced in practical applications. 
In general the paper makes a scientific contribution, to the field and fits nicely within the conferences scope.
