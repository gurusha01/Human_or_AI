The research paper focuses on the issue of learning Bayesian networks (BNs) taking into account ancestral constraints that are complex and cannot be broken down easily as observed in traditional structure learning methods that depend on decomposable scores. The authors expand upon the model presented by Chen et al. developed in 2015 and 2016 for optimal structure learning using decomposable scores and introduce a new technique to include ancestral constraints in the process. Their method involves deducing constraints, from ancestral ones to allow for the utilization of oracles specifically designed for decomposable scores. Based on real world data analysis outcomes indicate that the suggested approach is significantly more effective than systems, like those relying on integer linear programming (IL 
Advantages
The paper provides a contribution by tackling a key issue found in current methods, for learning Bayesian network structures successfully.The innovative approach of converting decomposable ancestral constraints into decomposable ones is original and influential. 
The authors conducted empirical tests to compare their method with ILD based approaches and showed significant efficiency improvements in the process.The experiments were carefully. Involved changing important factors such, as dataset size and number of variables to ensure the reliability of the results. 
Scalability is a suit of this approach as its effectiveness extends to scenarios involving up to 20 variables â€“ a performance level similar, to that of advanced methods used in Bayesian network learning.The pattern of starting off simple becoming complex before simplifying again seen in the experiments provides valuable insights and matches what one would expect based on theory. 
The findings underscore the importance of using knowledge (ancestral constraints) to enhance learning effectiveness and precision, in real world scenarios where gathering data can be costly. 
Areas, for improvement
The paper is well researched and informative; however it can be complex and hard to follow at times especially when delving into theoretical concepts like projecting constraints and the MaxSAT formulation.The inclusion of examples or visual aids could enhance understanding and make it more accessible, for readers. 
The authors in the paper compare their approach to ILp based methods. Do not delve much into discussing other options such as constraint based methods like PC or greedy search methods). This lack of exploration raises questions, about how widely applicable their proposed technique might be. 
The approach is designed to fit the limitations of conditions; however it's uncertain how effectively it can be applied to various non decomposable limits besides those discussed.An exploration of this issue would enhance the value of the research paper. 
Reasons, in Favor of Approval 
The article discusses an compelling issue within the realm of Bayesian network education. 
The new technique is innovative and robust from a standpoint while showing notable practical enhancements compared to current methods, in practice. 
The study holds real world significance by enhancing how we learn efficiently and accurately in practical settings. 
Reasons to Reject 
The paper could be made clearer for those who're not well versed in the technical intricacies of learning Bayesian networks. 
We could expand the assessment to consider how it relates to different learning styles, like heuristic based methods or constraint based approaches. 
Suggestion
In terms this document makes a valuable addition to the area of Bayesian network learning and would be suitable, for showcasing at NeurIPS. Even though there are areas where clarity and extent could use some enhancement, the originality of the aspects and the practical findings surpass these worries. I propose acceptance with adjustments to enhance readability and context.
