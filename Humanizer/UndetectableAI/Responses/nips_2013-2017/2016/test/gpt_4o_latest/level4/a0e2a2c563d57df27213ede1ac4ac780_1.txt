The paper presents the Sparse Diverse Region Classifier (SDR) a method inspired by the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM). It integrates a diversity component, into the regions chosen by RRSVM when training an image classifier aiming for uniqueness in the selected regions through an "Inhibition of Return" mechanism that prioritizes overlapping areas based on the standard intersection over union measure used in non maximum suppression (NMS).The researchers perform tests on the POET [26] MIT900 [8] and PET [13] datasets using RRSVM and SDR models that were trained on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. The assessment covers three scenarios ; a ) when there is one target present b ) when the target is absent and c ) when multiple targets are present. They use the Judd variant of the Area Under Curve ( AUC Judd ) as the metric, for evaluation which measures how well the method can predict where people will focus visually. The findings from the study show that implementing the Inhibition of Return process through NMS boosts effectiveness by, around 4%.  
The paper is nicely. Includes helpful visuals that make it easier to read and understand the content better. Moreover the detailed experimental procedure can be followed easily for others to replicate the findings. Nevertheless I have noticed two drawbacks, in the document; 
I understand the point about comparing methods that use object detector outputs to create priority maps. I'm not convinced that R CNN can be considered a solid baseline, for a few reasons. Firstly R CNN depends on Selective Search (as mentioned in Uijlings et al., IJCV '13) which is a recognized constraint. Since R CNN is no longer considered cutting edge technology nowadays and to address this issue effectively I suggest conducting the experiments using Faster R CNN (Ren et al., CVPR '15). Furthermore –. This is crucial – R CNN is specifically trained to enhance object detection accuracy by assessing how well the predicted object regions align with the actual bounding boxes, on the ground truth instead of predicting human visual attention by pinpointing fixation points location which serves a different purpose. It's no surprise that R CNN doesn't perform well in this situation since object detection and visual attention prediction are two tasks with different focuses—detects objects, as a whole and predicts specific areas of interest visually. 
When it comes to the AnnoBoxes baseline method discussed earlier on using bounding boxes in test images for visual attention prediction purposes. I think that while it does involve extra information utilization as mentioned in Section 4 point 2 of the paper. The way they incorporate this information seems to limit its potential benefits greatly. As explained in Section 4 point 2 of the paper about this technique. They generate a priority map by applying a Gaussian filter to a map where the position of the bounding box, around the target(s) is marked as 1 and everything else is marked as 0. It suggests that the important points marked as 1, in the map tend to cluster towards the middle of the bounding box; howeverthis alignment does not match up with where people naturally focus their gaze as seen in illustrations of animal related categories. The difference is also supported by the data in Table 1. The new SDR approach shows improvements for animal categories like cats and dogs compared to AnnoBoxes (with increases of 5%, 4%, 8% and 6% for cat cow dog horse respectively). As a result of this analysis against R CNN and AnnoBoxes lacks proof of the effectiveness of the proposed method, in predicting visual focus points. These findings indicate that concentrating on pinpointing objects may not always result in precise predictions of visual attention. This discovery might inspire the variety brought about by SDR through NMS. 
To improve the manuscript further I suggest running experiments to investigate how certain factors, like the overlap threshold in NMS for SDR and the width of the Gaussian blur kernel affect performance. Additionally it would be beneficial to make the conclusions from this study as they seemed a bit vague, in their current state. When comparing with methods I recommend considering the method introduced by Li and colleagues. The study (arxiv.org/1507) delves into identifying patterns in image areas crucial for categorizing images showing similarities, with the suggested SDR strategy. 
In summary ** ** despite the potential shown by the suggested approach and its links to research fields** ** I feel that the document is not fully prepared for publication yet**,** The authors are advised to integrate their work with existing literature**,** reconsider their selection of benchmarks**,** and carry out a detailed study to gain a deeper understanding of how different parameters, in their method impact the results.
