The authors describe a technique for teaching update functions within gradient based optimization methods by training both an optimizer and an optimize at the time in order to learn how to combine data from various gradients similar to momentum, in an LSTM based deep neural network model. Once trained successfully on this method of optimization learning process the optimizer becomes versatile and capable of being applied to tasks with some adaptability when faced with new network structures. Although we haven't delved into the aspects of the algorithms yet there have been a few small scale practical tests that suggest the new optimizers can hold their own against the best methods out there. I must say I really enjoyed reading this paper. I found it innovative and relevant with a lot of potential to make a difference. The idea of "learning algorithms" is quite intriguing in the realm of learning and this study seems like a positive move forward, in that area. Although the results of the experiment were satisfactory enough for me to appreciate them to some extent; I would have been more pleased if they had been evaluated using extensive benchmarks for comparison purposes. An intriguing aspect to explore would be whether implementing this method could enhance the training of a model complex as AlexNet. Furthermore; delving deeper into the post analysis could provide insights into the strategies employed by the optimizing networks that have been learned. Unraveling the signals they rely upon might spark ideas and directions for further research in optimization techniques, within the community. I was happily surprised by how the suggested algorithms did compared to the best existing options; however the degree of improvement was not as big as I had hoped for. This result might indicate that the current optimization algorithms are already quite efficient showing the advancements achieved by the optimization field. I would have appreciated witnessing this technique being used to tackle an unsolvable problem highlighting its distinctive abilities.
