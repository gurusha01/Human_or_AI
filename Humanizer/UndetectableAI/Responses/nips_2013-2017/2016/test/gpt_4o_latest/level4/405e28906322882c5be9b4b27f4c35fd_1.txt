The study delves into how people learn in an unpredictable fluctuating setting by looking at how much they may regret based on the shifts in average loss patterns (measured by either the frequency of changes or the extent of adjustments ) and the total randomness in losses over time.The researchers introduce methods that cap regrets and also outline comparable minimum limits, for them.   
Upon reflection;   
Apologies for the confusion. I agree that Theorem 4. 4 Is proven correctly and the environment created is unaware. My error, on this one.  
The simplification, in examining UCB V seems clear cut since the concentration inequalities utilized do not need the random variables to have identical distributions from what I remember. This holds true for both your situation and theirs.  
In reference to the comparison made to Jadbabaie et al.; If someone chooses \( M \) as the gradient in their study work and align it closely to your \( \Lambda \) (adjusted for constant factors) the main difference lies in how you handle expectations within the norms in \( V \). It appears that a minor adjustment, to their proof might enable moving the expectation.. You need to double check this carefully yourself and provide a thorough description of how it relates to other work – making it clear what directly follows and what doesn't.   
You should continue to explain why the suggested complexity parameters are important by giving an example where Λ's not zero or directly proportional, to T.  
Although the paper presents some ideas at first glance and implies interesting insights, into the subject matter; however it falls short in terms of addressing relevant prior research and accurately referencing crucial sources which makes it hard to evaluate how original the findings are since many of them seem to derive directly from earlier studies. The study conducted by Jadbabaie et al. highlighted in the references but not thoroughly examined in the text itself at arXiv 2015 conference paper presents an algorithm to Algorithm 2 that attains similar outcomes in a demanding adversarial environment.   
The primary focus of the paper highlighted by the authors is integrating the variability of losses into the study by utilizing methods for obtaining second order and shifting boundaries (such, as blocking in straightforward scenarios). Although this addition may present an angle to consider it seems that comparable concepts were previously investigated in the research conducted by Jadbabaie and colleagues in 2015 Therefore a detailed examination of the originality of the paper compared to past studies is crucial.   
Additionally the writing needs to be enhanced.. For instance the UCB V algorithm by Audibert and others, in 2009 which is practically copied in the paper isn't even mentioned.   
When discussing motivation in the paper it is important to clarify the significance of the proposed complexity measures. For example in situations where there is a subpar option available why does it become relevant if its average outcome changes or if it shows significant variability (especially when its minimal drawbacks surpass those of other options)? Moreover what are some practical situations where Λ does not remain constant nor follow a trend, over time?   
The explanation regarding the relationship to tracking and shifting bounds (Herbst and Warmuth in 1998 and 2001 respectively) also needs some clarification too. In standard online learning materials that I've come across before. Tracking and shifting bounds are usually associated with characteristics of the comparison sequence rather, than the loss functions themselves. It's important to distinguish between the two to prevent any misunderstandings from arising.   
The outcomes of the transitions should also relate to the research in information theory concerning encoding fragmented sources that show stability over time intervals. Although these studies typically emphasize logarithmic loss functions the fundamental methods are quite analogous by using entropy or entropy rates of variance. Moreover the literature contains strategies for addressing dormant specialists (, for instance Gyorgy et al., 2012) and it is important to recognize these contributions as well.   
Overall speaking about the paper potential and importance of revisions needed before its ready, for publication.
