This study presents a viewpoint on algorithms that don't require parameters by framing them as strategies in betting on coins to maximize rewards.. It starts by using a betting system based on the Krichevsky Trofimov estimator with a function, for coin betting then expands this method to optimize online learning in Hilbert spaces and learning from expert advice scenarios. Tests conducted on real world data sets confirm the success of the algorithm. The research paper provides a perspective on algorithms that do not require parameters by exploring coin betting with maximum rewards. Expanding on this idea the authors introduce a variety of algorithms, for online convex optimization and expert learning. The paper is well organized facilitating readers in understanding its content. To sum up this study is thorough. Presents creative viewpoints.
