The authors introduce theoretical ideas for graph clustering that don't depend on assumptions about how the graph was created (such as assuming the observed graph follows a certain model like the stochastic block model). The main concept of the paper is that if a method for graph clustering finds a cluster arrangement that fits the graph well (based on a definition) then any other equally fitting arrangement must be similar, to the initial one. This study is quite fascinating as it addresses an issue by presenting results on graph clustering that are not dependent, on distribution patterns. While some content was moved to the section to comply with the conferences page restrictions the paper overall is still easy to understand without having to constantly refer to the additional material.  
However I have some doubts about using the term "hats" to represent observed values (such, as \(\hat{L}\) for the Laplacian) as this choice of notation may not be optimal. That being said the paper is generally well crafted and fairly easy to understand. The findings presented are convincing thoroughly analyzed,. Backed up with illustrative instances. Nonetheless they do have constraints to consider. The experimental results show that some real life graphs need to be smoothed to expose patterns that match the framework put forth by the authors; however; many traditional algorithms can uncover the true structure without needing this kind of preprocessing.  
Additionally​ two important constraints are apparent; 1\) The primary outcome concerning the Partitioning Around Medoids (PFM for short) utilizes a measure of distance between clusterings​. The writers argue that this measure may be considered as a better fit than the traditional one; however​ this assertion is subject to debate. 2\) The findings are dependent on a type of "proxy" model. In this scenario​ a model (such as a Partitioning Around Medoids model ) is reconstructed based on a clustering. Subsequently compared to the original graph instead of directly comparing the clustering, to the graph or its generative process. Within the framework favored by the authors in this approach lies a natural inclination that places limitations on defining what qualifies as a satisfactory clustering for a specific graph scenario. It explicitly demands that the graph be closely approximated from a normalized perspective. While these constraints are essential for establishing outcomes and conclusions they prompt reflections about the wider consequences of such limitations particularly considering how they impact various real world datasets, within the confines of the frameworks restrictions.
