The paper discusses the difficulty of predicting the energy consumption of household devices using data on total energy use over time periods.The authors tackle this issue by utilizing a factorial HMM model and implementing various creative methods for inference such, as defining the problem as a convex semidefinite relaxation technique and incorporating random rounding and a proficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). They showcase the success of their technique on a computer generated dataset.The article delves into an issue and is crafted with precision. The suggested plan is detailed and consists of parts that are explained sequentially in a logical order in the document for easy understanding even, for those not well versed in the field; however one area that lacks clarity is the method used to calculate the quantity of appliances which could benefit from further elaboration in Section 5 by the authors. Moreover it would be important to grasp the level of sensitivity associated with this decision, in the assessment.
