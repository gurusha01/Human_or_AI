The paper presents a neural transducer" model designed for sequence to sequence tasks that processes information step by step, from left to right in real time instead of waiting for the complete input sequence before generating the output. The models success hinges on key advancements; the use of a recurrent attention mechanism and the addition of an end of block symbol in the output alphabet to signify shifts between input blocks.These changes are supported by algorithms that rely on dynamic programming and beam search, for both training and inference purposes.Tests run on the TIMIT speech recognition task showcase how well the model performs and delve into design parameters.  
This paper is well. Tackles a significant issue. Creating and teaching a sequence to sequence model that can work online without needing full input sequences upfront.The document gives an overview of the suggested structure and systematically discusses the design factors for its parts such as predicting the next step,the attention process and modeling at the end of a block.It also nicely outlines the difficulties in training and making inferences, with the model while suggesting solutions to these challenges. The results, from the TIMIT experiment are well suited for demonstrating the usefulness of the model and examining design elements like how recurrent states are managed across different blocks sizes and attention mechanisms and model complexity. 
However there are an areas, in the paper that could use some enhancements.  
On page 3 line 93 there seems to be an error, in the phrase "Firstly we calculate the likelihood of computing the chance of observing the output sequence."  
Section 3 is lacking a comparison of the three approaches to end of block modeling mentioned in the paper.The effectiveness of using the `<e>` symbol is. Not quantified in terms of performance differences, among the methods.Analyzing and presenting data would enhance the papers strength and credibility.   
Section 3 of the document discusses a method where alignments are computed frequently compared to model updates – similar to lattice based methods used in training acoustic models for speech recognition projects like those by D.Pove and P.C.Woodland in the ASR Workshop 2000 or B.Kingsburys work on lattice based optimization for neural network acoustic modeling in ICASSP 2009 conferences. There is potential for research, on the transducer model to delve into utilizing lattices as a means to represent alignment data effectively. Moreover techniques for adjusting lattice scores using neural network language models similar, to those outlined by X. Liu et al. ( ICASSP, 2014) could potentially be used to tackle the issue of conditioning the transducer on all input and output information up to the present time.   
On page 7 of the document in lines 202 and 203 substitute "Log Mel filterbanks" with "Log Mel spectra”, for precision.   
In Section 4 of the study conducted using TIMIT data set delves into conventional approaches compared to the usual methods followed in similar researches. Generally speaking the phone categories in TIMIT are merged extensively than what was carried out in this particular study and certain parts of the data are left out during training with a focus solely placed upon the primary test set. To further explore this concept refer to research works by T.N Sainath and others from 2011 published under IEEE Transactions Speech and Audio Processing or works, by K.F Lee and H.W Hon from 1989 published in IEEE Transactions covering Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing.  Following the experimental setup would enhance the comparability of the findings with previous studies and should be clearly outlined in the manuscript.   
In Section 4 the writers may have considered starting the transducer training with HMM GMM alignments before moving on to alignments determined by the transducer itself potentially leading to results, on TIMIT. 
In terms the paper makes a significant contribution, to the field; however resolving the mentioned concerns would improve its clarity, thoroughness and significance.
