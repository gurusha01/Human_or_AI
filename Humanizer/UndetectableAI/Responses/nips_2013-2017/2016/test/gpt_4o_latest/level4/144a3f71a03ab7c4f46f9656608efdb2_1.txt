This study focuses on solving the optimization challenge of constructing Bayesian networks based on local scores while adher​Ing to ancestral constraints​ in a search process that involves a branch and bound approach​ with nodes representing CPDAG​​​​​​​​​S in the search tree​ The transition from one CPDAG (CPDAG ₁ ), to another (CPDAG ₂ ) occurs through the selection of a parent set for a Bayesian network variable not yet included in CPDAG ₁ ​​ by employing symmetry breaking techniques as suggested by the authors​ The search algorithm operates within an A star framework. Utilizes the URLearning system to offer a heuristic (specifics not mentioned here but can be found in previous research). Ancestral constraints aid in trimming the search tree with Lemma 3 (detailed in the material) as a key outcome of the process. Though I am confident, in the accuracy of Lemma 3s statement I find the proof to be somewhat perplexed. The assertion that "According to the rules governing the generation of edges, by the EC tree​​​ method​​​ G_k ​ will also include the edge linking Z to W " needs explanation. 
Moreover the article talks about "understood restrictions " commonly known as that but called "anticipated restrictions" in this case A series of constraints can suggest edge limitations that aid in simplifying tasks The writers also deduce limitations regarding allowable sequential arrangements known as "arrangement limitations." Nevertheless; the procedure, for deducing these limitations is not adequately clarified. For example; when they say "we can infer that Y is less than Z from Z not being an ancestor of Y " the issue lies in the usage of the term "can." In Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scenarios where Z is not an ancestor of Y but Y is still considered less than Z (like in a graph with vertices Z and Y connected by no edges) this statement remains valid and consistent with the intended meaning by the authors—that when "Z is not an ancestor of Y " one has the option to enforce the constraint that Y is less, than Z. The objective is to deduce many reliable sequencing guidelines as feasible (beyond those absolutely necessary) and the writers utilize a MAXSAT technique to accomplish this task without adding unnecessary constraints. 
The research study tests variables and constraints while examining how the proposed system compares to GOBNILIP software in terms of efficiency and performance speed. Results indicate that the new approach outperforms GOBNILIP significantly in terms of speed. The authors mention that GOBNILIP generally falls short compared to A * methods in scenarios where there is no restriction on the size of parent sets. Since this study does not impose any restrictions it remains uncertain whether GOBNILIPs lackluster performance is due to its overall difficulty, in handling large parent sets or its specific struggles with ancestral constraints. Additionally to what was mentioned in the supporting documentation about ancestral limitations is founded on a MAXSAT encoding derived from [reference Cussens 2008] as opposed to the ILI encoding explained in Section 3 of [reference Cussens 2010]. The MAXSAT encoding utilized in this instance may not be the most effective for a systems operations.The optimal strategy would entail the inclusion of A(X,Y)) binary variables, alongside I(Z,U) while excluding the (a count of variables E(X,Y,Z)). The required limitations would involve rules about how the A(X Y) variables interact and the connection, between A. I variables.   
The value of function A(X,Y ) is greater than or equal, to the sum of all elements U where X's an element of U multiplied by the information shared between Y and U.  
If X is considered a parent of Y in this context then it implies that X is also regarded as an ancestor of Y in the relationship setting for better results. This approach follows the guidelines in Section 3 of Cussens work from 2010 where a specific order of variables is assumed; however one limitation arises as "ancestor" signifies a partial, than complete order.  
The authors seem confident that their proposed system would perform better than GOBNILIP with a designed ILF formulation for ancestral constraints in place; however they weaken their argument by comparing it to a suboptimal encoding rather than a stronger one.They also suggest comparing their approach, to van Beek and Hoffmanns method which has been known to outperform GOBNILIP at times.Adapting van Beek and Hoffmanns method to incorporate constraints should not pose significant challenges.It's worth noting that the authors fail to reference the paper by van Beek and Hoffman in their work.
