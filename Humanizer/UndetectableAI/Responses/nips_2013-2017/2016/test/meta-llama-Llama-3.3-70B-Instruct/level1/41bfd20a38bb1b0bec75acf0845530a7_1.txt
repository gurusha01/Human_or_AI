This study introduces an approach known as Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) which aims to optimize the configurations of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The goal is to decrease the burden of DNN models without compromising their accuracy levels or potentially enhancing them further using a method derived from the concept of group Lasso regularization, for flexible adjustment of various DNN structures. 
The article is nicely. Effectively covers the reasons, behind the studys objectives and approach while presenting the findings from experiments clearly. 
The test outcomes show that SSL is efficient in cutting down on expenses and enhancing precision levels the researchers test their approach on various standard datasets like MNIST,CIFAR10 and ImageNet then compare its performance with other cutting edge techniques.The findings indicate that SSL can deliver performance boosts on both CPU and GPU setups with around 5point one times and 3point one times acceleration, per layer on an average respectively. 
The notable aspects of this paper are the following; 
The new approach is innovative. Clearly driven by a real need, in the field of deep learning. 
The results of the experiment are detailed and clearly presented to show how well SSL works. 
The authors offer an brief description of the approach and previous research, in the field. 
The shortcomings of this paper are; 
The paper might be improved by providing a thorough examination of the computational challenges and memory needs associated with SSL. 
The writers might offer perspectives on the balance, between computational expenses and accuracy compared to model intricacy. 
The readability and clarity of figures and tables could use some enhancement. 
In terms and writing skills are good in this paper and it offers a noteworthy addition to the realm of deep learning.Extending the method could enhance the effectiveness and precision of DNN systems which would be beneficial, to the community.
