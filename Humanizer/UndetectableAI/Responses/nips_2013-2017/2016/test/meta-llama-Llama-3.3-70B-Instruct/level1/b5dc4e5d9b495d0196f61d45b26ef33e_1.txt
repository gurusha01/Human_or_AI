This research introduces an approach called the homotopy smoothing (HOPS) method to address a range of challenging optimization issues that lack smoothness properties. The key concept behind HOPS involves initiating with a smoothing factor and then reducing it incrementally in stages while leveraging the solution obtained in the previous stage as a starting point, for the subsequent phase. The researchers demonstrate that HOPS has a number of iterations required (approximately Ô​ ​ ( ̧​ ​​​​​​​​) ​ ) compared to the current algorithms available on the market when the value of theta (θ) which falls within the range of zero and one captures how quickly the objective function changes, around its optimal solutions. 
The paper is nicely written with an succinct introduction to the issue and the algorithm being proposed by the authors The theoretical examination is thorough and backed up by a comprehensive explanation of the iteration complexity of HOPS The results, from experiments show that HOPS is highly effective when compared to other cutting edge algorithms
