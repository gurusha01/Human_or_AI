This research paper introduces an unsupervised loss function that leverages the randomness of methods like randomized data augmentation and dropout in convolutional neural networks (Convnets). Named as transformation/stability loss function it aims to reduce the variance in predictions, from passes of a single training sample through the network. The authors also integrate this loss function with a mutual exclusivity loss function to ensure that the classifiers prediction vector contains a single non zero element. 
The paper is nicely. Effectively elaborates on the reasons behind introducing the suggested loss function.The authors offer an overview of previous studies in semi supervised learning that cover methods like self training,cotraining and generative models.They also delve into advancements in semi supervised deep learning,such, as ladder networks and predictive sparse decomposition. 
The studies included meticulously planned experiments that encompass a variety of widely recognized datasets like MNIST, SVHN... CIFAR100 and ImageNet. The findings indicate that the suggested loss function has an impact in enhancing the precision of Convnets particularly in scenarios with limited labeled samples. Additionally the authors illustrate that integrating transformation/stability loss with mutual exclusivity loss can result in enhancements, in accuracy.
