This article presents the Neural Transducer. A sequence to sequence model that generates output sequences gradually as it receives input data in real time instead of waiting for the entire input sequence like conventional models do.The model aims to overcome the constraints of sequence, to sequence models by linking the output sequence to both the observed partial input and the generated partial output sequences. 
The paper discusses research on sequence to sequence models by Bahdanau et al [2]. Chorowski etal [6]. However the Neural Transducer stands out from these models as it can generate output sequences gradually without needing the full input sequence upfront.It also has connections to structured prediction techniques, like HMM DNN [11].CTCs have a dependency between predictions, at each output step unlike assuming independence. 
The papers notable attributes lie in its neatly structured layout along with its comprehensive assessment of the Neural Transducer across various tasks such as a simple addition task and phone recognition task using the TIMIT dataset. The findings demonstrate that the Neural Transducer can deliver performance on par with cutting edge sequence, to sequence models while enabling generation of output sequences. 
The paper has some flaws such as the models complexity that might pose challenges, in its training and optimization efforts. It could also improve by conducting a thorough examination of how well the model performs with longer sequences and comparing it to other models capable of generating output incrementally.
