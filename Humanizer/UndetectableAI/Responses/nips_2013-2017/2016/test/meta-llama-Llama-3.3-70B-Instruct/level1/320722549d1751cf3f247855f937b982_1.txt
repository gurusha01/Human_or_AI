This article introduces an approach to creating algorithms without parameters for online linear optimization (OLO) in Hilbert spaces and learning with expert advice (LEAs). The authors present a perspective by framing parameter free algorithms as coin betting algorithms that unveil the shared underlying framework of past parameter free algorithms for OLO and LEAs alike.The paper further offers optimal connections from coin betting to OLO, in Hilbert spaces and LEAs..
The papers notable aspects are; 
A novel and user friendly framework has been introduced for creating algorithms without the need for parameters; it offers a perspective, on existing algorithms and enables the development of innovative ones. 
The offer of discounts for cash wagers in OLO, across Hilbert spaces and LEAP is both innovative and ideal. 
New algorithms have been introduced for OLO and LEAP that reach the possible worst case limits, on regret. 
After studying the algorithms and testing them in real world scenarios we found that the practical results confirm the actual disparity, between traditional online learning algorithms and parameter free ones. 
The papers drawbacks are as follows; 
The paper suggests that the reward vectors are limited in some cases but not in all situations. 
The paper lacks a comparison with other cutting edge algorithms, in the realms of OLO and LEAs. 
The practical assessment is restricted to a handful of datasets and may not accurately reflect all potential situations. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The article introduces an easy to understand approach for creating algorithms without the need for parameters. A valuable addition, to the field. 
The transitions from using coins for betting to learning over Hilbert spaces and locally euclidean embeddings are innovative and efficient; this offers a fresh outlook, towards addressing the issue at hand. 
The latest algorithms discussed in the paper reach the possible upper limits on regret, in the worst case scenario. A notable advancement compared to earlier algorithms. 
Reasons to consider accepting; 
The paper suggests that the reward vectors have limits imposed upon them but acknowledges that this assumption may not hold true in every situation. 
The article lacks a comparison with other cutting edge algorithms, in the fields of OLO and LEAP studies; this absence hinders the assessment of the contributions importance. 
The practical assessment is confined to a handful of datasets and may not accurately reflect all potential situations. 
In terms the study makes a notable impact on the realm of internet education and the positive aspects of the study surpass its shortcomings.The introduction of an approach for creating algorithms without parameters and offering innovative and optimal transitions from betting on coins to One Loss online learning over Hilbert spaces and Linear Expectation Algorithm makes the study a valuable inclusion, in the field.
