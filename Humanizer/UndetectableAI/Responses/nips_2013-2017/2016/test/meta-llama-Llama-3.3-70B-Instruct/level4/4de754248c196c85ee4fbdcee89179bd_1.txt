This document delves into the difficulty of determining the power usage of appliances in a home using time based data on overall energy consumption.The writers introduce a HMM model with an additive approach to tackle this problem by utilizing methods, like convex semidefinite relaxation and an optimized ADMM technique to calculate estimates successfully.The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed through the use of data. The article introduces an issue and is well organized with a detailed solution that is divided into clear and orderly steps, for easy understanding by those not well acquainted with the subject matter.The authors provide a concise and comprehensive explanation of their work; however a part that needs clarification is the approach taken to calculate appliance numbers discussed in more detail in Section 5. Furthermore investigating how accurate this estimation is, in real world scenarios would offer insights and deepen our comprehension of the suggested method.
