This paper discusses the challenge of optimizing the learning of networks with local scores and ancestral constraints using a branch and bound search method that uses CPDAG representations for nodes in the search tree.The search involves transitioning from one CPDAG to another by choosing a parent set for a variable, in the network that is not part of the original CPDAG and employing practical symmetry breaking strategies. The exploration is also directed by an A star method and utilizes the URLearning platform for guidance; exact details of this fusion are not specified in the document but are available, in a previous release.  
Considering the limitations from our ancestors practices and beliefs the exploration tree can be trimmed using criteria outlined in Lemma 3 found in the additional resources. A key finding to note.Course the explanation for Lemma 3 isn't completely straightforward specially the part concerning how the rules for generating EC tree edges lead to a specific edge being present.Moreover the idea of implied limitations,called "projected constraints" here enables trimming by suggesting restrictions, on edges according to a collection of ancestral limitations. The writers also deduce limitations on topological sequences known as "ordering constraints " although the exact method, behind this deduction remains somewhat unclear.  
When figuring out these ordering rules the idea is that if a variable isn't linked directly to another one in the hierarchy then it's possible to set a rule about their sequence relationship. The goal here is to deduce many consistent sequencing rules as we can without making things too rigid by utilizing a MAXSAT method for deduction. Experiments are carried out where the number of variables and data points along with constraints are changed up and the performance is compared to the GOBNIL system. The findings reveal that our current approach is considerably speedier, than GOBNIL.  
However it has been observed that the performance problems of GOBNILIP may be due to its challenges in managing a number of parent sets overall rather than just grappling with ancestral restrictions exclusively. Additionally the representation of restrictions in the evaluation is derived from a MAXSAT model in a previous study, which may not be the most effective approach for an ILPS, like GOBNILIP. Perhaps a better approach could be to utilize variables to directly signify ancestral connections and then impose restrictions that connect these variables with the current formulation.This could potentially result in a stringent linear relaxation and improved overall performance.  
The paper could be improved by comparing it to a practical approach to ancestral limitations for GOBNIL or by exploring other comparable techniques like the strategy proposed by van Beek and Hoffmann which has demonstrated superior performance in certain scenarios compared to GOBNIL and could be adjusted to incorporate ancestral constraints efficiently as well.The absence of these comparisons and the utilization of a less effective formulation, for GOBNIL diminishes the papers findings on its overall effectiveness.
