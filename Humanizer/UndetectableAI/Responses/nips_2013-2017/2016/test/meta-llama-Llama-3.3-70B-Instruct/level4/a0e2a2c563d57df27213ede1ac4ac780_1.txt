The study introduces a method called Sparse Diverse Region Classifier (SDR) expanding upon the Region Ranking SVM (RRSVM) technique [29]. It adds variety in the chosen regions through a strategy known as "Inhibition of Return" ensuring that only regions with spatial overlap are chosen. The overlap is determined using the intersection, over union criterion typically used in maximum suppression (NMS). Tests were carried out using the POET [26] MIT900 dataset.The study experimented with RRSVM and SDR models trained on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset using [8]. Pet [13] analyzing different situations such as having a single target present or absent or multiple targets present in the scene for performance evaluation using the Judd variation of Area Under Curve (AUC Judd) that gauges the methods effectiveness in identifying visual fixation points accurately. The findings suggest that the incorporated Inhibition of Return mechanism enhanced by NMI led to an improvement in performance by, around 4%. 
The paper is nicely structured with visuals that make it easy to understand and follow along, with the experiments laid out in a transparent manner to help others reproduce the results accurately; however The author points out two notable shortcomings;  
I appreciate the comparison to techniques that merge object detector results to form priority maps; however the selection of R CNN as a reference point is debatable.The use of R CNN as a baseline is questionable because it heavily relies on Selective Search (as detailed by Uijlings et al. IjCV '13) a method, for generating object proposals.Additionally R CNN is tailored for object detection. May not align well with predicting human visual attention patterns. An idea is proposed to redo the trials using Faster R CNN (Ren et al., published in CVPR 2015) aiming to tackle these shortcomings. 
Secondly  when it comes to the AnnoBoxes baseline it is recognized that this approach relies on an amount of information ( annotated bounding boxes on test images ). However the use of this information is thought to diminish its effectiveness in predicting attention. The process of generating priority maps in AnnoBoxes involves applying a Gaussian filter on a map centered around object bounding boxes, which may not accurately capture fixation points especially in classes related to animals. This can be seen in the performance difference between the proposed SDR method and AnnoBoxes, for these specific classes. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting attention is not strongly supported by comparing it with R CNN and AnnoBoxes alone; rather it showcases the difference, between object localization and visual attention prediction which emphasizes the importance of diversity brought about by SDR through NMS. 
To enhance the papers quality and credibility further changes should be implemented by carrying out experiments that assess how parameters like the overlap in Non Maximum Suppression (NMS) for Single Detection Return (SDR) and the size of the Gaussian blur kernel affect performance results. Moreover it is important to provide definitive conclusions and make comparisons with existing studies like the approach outlined by Li et al (arxiv.org/1506/06343) that focuses on identifying visual patterns in image regions that are crucial, for image classification.  
The paper isn't quite ready for publication yet as it needs some adjustments and further exploration of its place in existing research and the impact of parameters, through a thorough study to better showcase the potential of the suggested approach.
