This document introduces a viewpoint on algorithms that don't require parameters by highlighting their fundamental nature as high reward coin betting strategies. The process begins with a betting algorithm that incorporates the Krichevsky Trofimov estimator and a coin betting potential function and then expands to optimizing learning in Hilbert Space and leveraging expert advice, for learning. Experiments conducted on real world datasets validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The article presents a perspective on parameter free algorithms by likening them to betting with coins for maximum gain.These insights have led to the creation of algorithms for online convex optimization and expert guided learning.The paper is well organized for reader clarity and understanding.In summary this study is thorough. Offers fresh insights, in the field.
