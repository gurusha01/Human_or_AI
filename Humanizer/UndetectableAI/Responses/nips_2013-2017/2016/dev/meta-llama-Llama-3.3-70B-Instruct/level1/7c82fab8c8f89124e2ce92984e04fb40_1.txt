This paper makes an addition to research on selective inference in group sparse linear regression settings by introducing a methodology for creating confidence intervals and p values to assess specific variable groupsâ€”a key component of selective inference research building on earlier studies, like Lee et al.' s "polyhedral lemma" and Loftus and Taylors work on group sparse regression. 
The primary finding of the research paper is the "truncated projection lemma," which describes how the datas projection magnitude onto a subspace is distributed based on a selected event conditionality. This discovery empowers the authors to create tools for making inferences using group sparse selection techniques, like group lasso iterative hard thresholding and forward stepwise regression.
The paper is nicely structured with an thorough explanation of the technical findings presented by the authors research work. The numerical tests illustrate how well the suggested methods work in practice while the outcomes concerning California health data reveal how useful this approach can be, in real world scenarios. 
The papers positive aspects are; 
A new approach has been created to make inferences, in group sparse linear regression.
Clear and concise technical results explanation is provided.
 Showing how well the suggested approaches work by conducting tests. 
Exploring how this method is used with data, in the real world.
The paper has some flaws, such, as; 
The idea of having a predetermined design matrix might not always align with real life scenarios.
There is a need for a comparison with current techniques in dealing with selective inference, within group sparse regression.
The possible computational intricacy of the suggested approaches could be a concern when dealing with datasets.
Reasons supporting approval; 
The research paper makes an addition to the realm of selective inference, within group sparse linear regression.
The innovative findings are original. Thoughtfully justified.
The results, from the numerical trials showcase the efficiency of the suggested approaches. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to understand. 
Reasons to not agree; 
The idea of using a fixed design matrix could potentially restrict the usefulness of this method.
Without a comparison, to other methods it could be challenging to evaluate how well the proposed approach performs in comparison.
The potential difficulty, in computing with the suggested techniques might be worrisome when dealing with data sets.
In my opinion the paper makes a valuable contribution to the area of inference, in group sparse linear regression and its strengths outweigh any weaknesses it may have had.I suggest accepting the paper with some revisions to tackle the mentioned weaknesses.
