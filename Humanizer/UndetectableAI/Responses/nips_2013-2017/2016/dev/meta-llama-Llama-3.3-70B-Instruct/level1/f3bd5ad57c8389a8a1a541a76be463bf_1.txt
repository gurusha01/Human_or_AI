This study suggests a method for estimating depth using just one camera by teaching a neural network to forecast likelihoods over small parts of the scenes depth map in an excessive representation form.The model generates likelihoods for spatial changes at each point to demonstrate certainty and uncertainty, about different facets of the scenes structure.A global approach is later employed to merge these small scale forecasts and create a depth map. 
The study discusses research on estimating depth from a single image using various methods such as direct depth regression and surface normals prediction techniques commonly explored in the field. Of solely focusing on these traditional methods, like previous works have done so far this new approach focuses on predicting a wider range of structural relationships and utilizes a distributional output space to capture uncertainties in the predictions. The authors showcase the effectiveness of their method by testing it on the NYU v2 depth dataset and achieving results compared to existing approaches. 
This paper excels in its method for estimating depth from a single image and its capability to identify uncertainty, in predictions accurately while achieving top notch results on a standard dataset.Its utilization of a representation and global approach enables the network to efficiently capture the depth information in a standalone image.
