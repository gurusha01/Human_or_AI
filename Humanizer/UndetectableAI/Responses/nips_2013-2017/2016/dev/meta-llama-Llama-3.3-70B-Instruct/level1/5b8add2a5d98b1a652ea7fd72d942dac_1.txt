This study introduces a method called Truncated Generalized Gradient Flow (TGGGF) to address quadratic equation systems challenges. While the general problem is considered NP hard the authors demonstrate that TGGGF can accurately retrieve the solution with a likelihood when the equation count aligns with the unknown count. The approach involves two phases ; an initial step that emphasizes orthogonality and a subsequent improvement of the preliminary approximation, through iterative adjustments using truncated generalized gradient iterations.
The research paper discusses connections to studies on phase recovery and optimization methods that are not necessarily convex or linear in nature and quadratic programming techniques as well.\ The authors reference key papers numbered [1 to 7] and examine the drawbacks of current methodologies like the alternating projection approach and trust region strategies along with convex relaxation tactics.\ MoreoverÂ¸ they contrast the TGG algorithm against cutting edge methods such, as Wirtinger Flow (WF) and Truncated Wirtinger Flow (TWF).
The papers positive aspects are; 
The new method called TGGFa has a time complexity that scales linearly with the size of the problem it tackles which allows it to handle large scale challenges efficiently. 
The concept of orthogonality promoting initialization is a method that surpasses traditional spectral initialization techniques in performance. 
The rule, for truncation applied in TGGFa is straightforward and efficient as it helps the algorithm steer clear of any standstill points.
