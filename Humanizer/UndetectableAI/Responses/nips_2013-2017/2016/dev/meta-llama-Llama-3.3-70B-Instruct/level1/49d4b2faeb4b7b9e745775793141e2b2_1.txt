This research paper introduces a design for teaching complex deep generative models, with multiple layers of hidden variables known as Matryoshka Networks (MatNets). By merging the advantages of DRAW style models and Ladder Networks in a new way to form a class of models capable of understanding deep generative patterns with inference and generation processes trained simultaneously in one model structure. 
The paper is nicely. Well structured which helps in following the authorsâ€™ points and grasping the technical aspects of the suggested architecture easily.The authors have thoroughly examined works, like LapGANs,Dffusion Nets and Probabilistic Ladder Networks and have shown how their method overcomes the shortcomings of these prior techniques. 
The papers notable aspects are; 
The new MatNet design is innovative and backed by reasoning as it tackles a major obstacle, in training complex generative models. 
The writers offer an easily understandable breakdown of the technical aspects of the structure. Discussing lateral connections as well as shortcut and residual connections, in depth. 
The results from the experiments show how well the MatNet design works on standard datasets like MNIST and CIFAR 10 as well, as Omniglot. 
The writers conduct an examination of the findings and delve into the constraints of the method as well as possible directions, for upcoming research endeavors. 
The paper has some drawbacks such, as; 
The article is quite lengthy and complex which can make it difficult to fully grasp in one go. 
Some readers who are not well versed in learning and variational inference might find certain technical terms, like stochastic gradient variational Bayes and the reparametrization trick a bit challenging to understand. 
The authors should delve deeper into exploring the real world uses of the MatNet design beyond just the standard datasets tested in the research studies. 
In my opinion this article adds insights to the realm of deep learning and creative models. It showcases how the MatNet design has the capability to tackle issues, in computer vision and beyond. I suggest considering this article for publication at NIPS.
