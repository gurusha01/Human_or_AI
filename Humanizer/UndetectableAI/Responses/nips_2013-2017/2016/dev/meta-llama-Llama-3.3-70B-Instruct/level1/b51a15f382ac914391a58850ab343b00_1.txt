This research introduces the Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) a framework, for handling partial monitoring (CPM ) games that merges the combinatorial nature of combinatorial multi arm bandits (CMAB ) with the limited feedback characteristic of partial monitoring (PM ) games. The authors also present another algorithm called PEG E 2 which integrates gap estimation with a PEG E algorithm to achieve a regret bound of O(logT ) on the distribution. 
The article discusses research conducted at NIPS and other places that focused on CPM games by [author] who introduced a Global Confidence Bound (GCB) algorithm with regret bounds that are independent of distribution at O(T 2 / ̠ log T ) and dependent on distribution, at O(log T). The writers claim that their approach called the "PEGE framework" offers benefits compared to the GCB method; it doesn't need the arg secondmax oracle or the presence of a single best action, for regret based distribution and it also provides regret limits that are not influenced by the learners action space size. 
The papers strong points are; 
A new algorithmic framework called PEGF has been suggested to attain regret bounds compared to GCB. 
The incorporation of PEG Epsilon Greedy ² (PEGE²) blending gap assessment with PEG Epsilon Greedy (PEGE) results in a boundary of O(logT) which is contingent, on the distribution. 
The assessment of the regret limits of the suggested algorithms offers insights into balancing exploration and exploitation, in CPM games. 
The use of the suggested algorithms, in a real life scenario involving ranking with feedback positioned at the top showcases the capabilities of these algorithms in practical situations. 
The paper has some shortcomings such, as; 
The idea of a visible collection that may not be consistently met in real world scenarios. 
Understanding the timeframe (T) needed for PEGEE 202 in situations may not always be feasible. 
The absence of testing, for the suggested algorithms hinders a deeper understanding of their real world effectiveness. 
The papers findings provide an addition to the realm of online education and decision making strategies within CPM games settings The suggested methods PEGD and PEGD2 offer solutions applicable in various situations like online ratings systems and recommendation systems where access, to feedback is restricted. 
In favor of acceptance some points to consider are; 
The research paper introduces an algorithmic structure called PEGG that attains comparable regret limits in relation, to GCB. 
Introducing PEG E² merges gap estimation, with PEG E to create an algorithm for regret that depends on distribution more effectively. 
The examination of the regret limits of the suggested algorithms offers perspectives on the balance between exploring and exploiting in CPM games. 
The use of the suggested algorithms in addressing a real life issue like ranking with top feedback showcases the capabilities of these algorithms, in practical situations. 
Points, in favor of acceptance; 
In reality the idea of having an observable group may not always hold true. 
Sometimes knowing the time horizon (T) for PEG E π₂ may not be possible, in every situation. 
The absence of real world testing for the suggested algorithms could lead to doubts, about how they would actually work in practical situations.
