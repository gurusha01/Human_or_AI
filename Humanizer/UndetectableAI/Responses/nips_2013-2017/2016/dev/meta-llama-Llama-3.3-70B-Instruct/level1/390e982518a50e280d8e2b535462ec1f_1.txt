In this paper is a model introduced for graph data known as diffusion based convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The authors propose a diffusion based convolution process that helps in understanding information from graph data to aid in tasks like node classification.The model offers appealing features such, as a representation that remains unchanged under isomorphism conditions and enables quick prediction and learning processes that can be efficiently executed on a GPU. 
The article is very well written and neatly structured which makes it simple to understand and follow along with the ideas presented by the authors regarding the challenges of working with data and the importance of having a versatile model that can effectively process graph based data structures.They also offer an in depth explanation of the DCNN model along, with the diffusion convolution feature. Illustrate its application in tasks related to classifying nodes. 
The experiments illustrate how DCNN models perform well in node classification tasks using datasets like Coran and Pubmed The findings indicate that DCNN models surpass other basic approaches such as probabilistic relational models and kernel methods The researchers also present learning curves, for the Coran and Pubmed datasets showing how DCNN models can effectively learn from limited training data. 
The paper also talks about the drawbacks of DCNN technology like scalability problems and the difficulty in capturing long distance relationships between elements The writers recognize these challenges and propose areas, for further research to tackle them. 
The section discussing research offers a detailed summary of the various methods used in graph based neural network models and kernel methods for probabilistic relational models. The writers effectively outline the distinctions, between DCNN and these established methods while emphasizing the aspects of their work. 
The paper is nicely written with an concise explanation of the DCNN model and how its used in various applications showcased through the experiments conducted by the authors; also the related work section presents a comprehensive overview of the current literature available, on this topic. 
Reasons, in favor of agreeing to the proposition; 
The article introduces an thoroughly justified framework, for data represented in graph structures.

Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The challenges, with scaling Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) could restrict their use in handling large graphs. 
The effectiveness of DCNN models on tasks may be restricted due to the possible inability to capture long distance spatial relationships, between nodes. 
The article would be more comprehensive with extra tests, on graph classification assignments to showcase the efficiency of DCNN models. 
In my opinion. the paper is nicely. Makes a valuable addition to the realm of graph based neural network models.The experiments showcase the power of DCNNs and the section discussing research offers a comprehensive look at the current literature.Although there are some constraints with the model the authors recognize these limitations. Propose possible avenues, for future exploration.As such I suggest that we approve the paper.
