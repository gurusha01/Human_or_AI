This study introduces a way to determine decision thresholds in the drift diffusion model of decision making based on perception.The researchers suggest two approaches, to fine tune the decision thresholds;a REINFORCE technique inspired by Williams’ REINFORCE algorithm used in training neural networks and a Bayesian optimization approach that applies a Gaussian process to the reward system.These approaches demonstrate effectiveness in converging towards optimal decision thresholds as compared to an optimization of the reward system. 
The article is nicely. Well structured for easy comprehension of the authors’ points and methods.The opening section offers an overview of the drift diffusion model and the sequential probability ratio test while the methodology section precisely delineates the two strategies employed to improve decision thresholds.The outcome section delivers an examination of both approaches comparing their convergence rates,variance and computational expenses. 
The papers strong points lie in its method for determining decision thresholds and its detailed comparison of the two techniques along with validation using data from studies on animal learning behavior.The authors also offer an exploration of the constraints and possible enhancements to their methods illustrating an, in depth grasp of the topic at hand. 
One drawback of the paper is that the Bayesian optimization approach shows variability in its threshold estimates and takes longer to compute when compared to the REINFORCE method. The authors do recognize this limitation. Propose possible enhancements, for the Bayesian optimization technique. 
The paper excels in quality assessment based on its clarity and originality standards in the review process. It displays a technical foundation with a well explained methodological approach and results. The language used is straightforward and to the point which helps in comprehension of the authors’ viewpoints and research methodology. Moreover the paper introduces a method for acquiring decision thresholds showing uniqueness and importance, in its findings. 
The paper holds importance in its ability to enhance our comprehension of making decisions based on perception and the neural processes behind it. The discovery by the authors that the REINFORCE technique serves as a model for animal learning reinforces the notion that learning driven by rewards is crucial in making perceptual decisions. Furthermore the paper suggests implications for creating more productive approaches, for adjusting decision thresholds across various uses. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The article introduces a method, for understanding decision thresholds within the drift diffusion model. 
The writers offer an analysis of both approaches differences regarding how quickly they reach a conclusion and the amount of variation and computational resources involved. 
The article is nicely. Well structured which helps in understanding the authors’ points and approach easily. 
The researchers confirm their approaches by comparing them to findings from studies on animal behavior and learning that suggest the importance of learning through rewards, in making decisions based on perception. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The Bayesian optimization approach tends to show variability in its threshold estimations and takes longer to compute when contrasted with the REINFORCE method. 
The paper would be improved by delving into the limitations and biases of the methods employed in greater detail. 
The writers should offer background information regarding the importance of their discoveries and how they impact the realm of perceptual decision making.
