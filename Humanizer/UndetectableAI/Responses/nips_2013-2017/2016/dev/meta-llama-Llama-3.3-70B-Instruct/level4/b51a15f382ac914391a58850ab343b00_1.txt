The writers discuss a problem involving random combinations and partial monitoring in a dynamic scenario where an unspecified vector theta is created based on a set distribution in each round and the operator picks an option, from a potentially limitless collection to receive a reward linked to the chosen option and theta through a known function. Of getting the reward or complete vector theta as feedback afterwards though the operator gets a modified version of theta determined by the chosen option and strives to minimize any potential feelings of regret. The writers suggest two methods using the Phased Exploration and Greedy Exploitation approach that includes switching between exploration and exploitation phases of set durations while one version includes an assessment of the gap between them. They offer evaluations for both techniques. Establish regret bounds that depend on the problem itself and others that are problem independent but align with previous studies in complexity over time T while being unique in not depending on the number of options available or necessitating a single optimal option, for the problem independent bound. Furthermore they showcase an example related to ranking. The paper is nicely organized and easy to understand; it introduces concepts such as employing the PEG framework to reduce reliance on the number of arms and assigning samples for better estimation of gaps to enhance the regret bound specific to the problem at hand.I suggest approving this paper. I do have a few inquiries, for the authors;  
The article doesn't touch upon the levels of regret, for the stochastic CPM issue.Is there any information regarding these limits and how do they stack up against the limits outlined in the paper? 
The global observable set selection lacks detail is there any approach, for selecting the global observable set sigma to reduce \beta_\sigma?  
After reviewing the counterargument presented to me my evaluation stands firm.
