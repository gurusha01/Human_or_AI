The research paper introduces a way to use matrix product states decomposition (MPS) of tensor networks for tackling multiclass supervised classification challenges.It assumes readers have some knowledge of MPS and tensor networks often seen in quantum physics.The study builds on works (references [3] and [4]) offering a small but related addition, to the existing body of research. The main contributions can be summarized into two points; a). Introducing a tensor inspired encoding (kernel) which's useful for classification tasks involving fixed length vector data. B). Enhancing the MPS representation for classification purposes, through descent optimization; this differs from [4] where the MPS representation is initially selected unsupervised and subsequently employed for classification separately.  
Here are a few ideas to improve the paper;  
Given that not everyone in the NIPS community may be familiar with tensor networks and MPS background knowledge providin a detailed introduction, to these concepts could greatly enhance the readability of the paper even though there are space limitations to consider in a NIPS publication. 
Enhancing readability can be achieved by incorporating dimensions into vectors and matrices. 
There seems to be a difference between the zigzag pattern mentioned in line 153 and the image in Figure 8; the picture doesn't show a zigzag design as described there could be a typo or an incorrect reference, to the illustration that needs clarification. 
In the beginning of the paper it would help to explain the distinctions between this study and references [ source] and [fourth source]. This will make it easier, for readers who're new to tensor networks to grasp the concepts presented. 
The mention of networks, in the paper seems informative but is only briefly touched upon towards the conclusion and would benefit from more detailed explanation to better grasp its significance. 
The specifics of how the process starts up and deals with minimums are crucial, to understanding the methods strength and reliability. 
Adding details, about the tools employed in computing SVD could enhance the reproducibility and clarity of the results.
