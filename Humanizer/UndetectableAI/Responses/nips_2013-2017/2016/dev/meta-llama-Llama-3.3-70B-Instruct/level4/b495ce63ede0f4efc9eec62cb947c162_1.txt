This document introduces a technique using deep learning to create connections between pairs of images by combining a fully convolutional network (FCN) a newly developed correspondence contrastive loss function and an active hard negative mining approach. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments on datasets available to the public and provide a detailed and well defined description of their process along, with convincing outcomes. However delving deeper into the meaning and nuances of this method would offer clarity and improve our grasp of the strategy overall.
