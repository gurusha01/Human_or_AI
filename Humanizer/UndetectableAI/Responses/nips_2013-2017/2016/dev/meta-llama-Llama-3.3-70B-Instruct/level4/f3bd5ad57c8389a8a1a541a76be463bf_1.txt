This document introduces a method, for determining the depth of an image from a single perspective using monocular vision technology instead of relying solely upon machine learning models or complex algorithms. The findings shared regarding the NYU2 dataset show promising outcomes that highlight the success of this method in practice.The paper showcases strong points such, as its use of probabilities to address uncertainties and the consensus stage that offers a smart way to tackle ambiguities.While the research doesn't introduce ideas it holds significant value.Yet it raises inquiries and issues;  
Using a collection of derived characteristics is a fascinating decision; however it would be advantageous to consider the option of acquiring these features organically within the system by possibly employing an iterative method. 
Wouldn't it be more suitable and efficient to consider using Expectation Maximization of K means for parameter learning, in Section 3​​​‌​‌​​​​​​‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​​​​​​​​‍​​^**^.
The speed at which the method processes information during testing raises concerns, about its efficiency – it would be helpful if the authors could share some typical running times for reference. 
Table 2 analysis indicates that the order filters stand out as elements, in the study findings show minimal performance distinctions compared to the full model – perhaps the authors can shed light upon this discovery?
