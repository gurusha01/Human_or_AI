This paper brings together graph kernels within a diffusion based convolutional neural network framework.The authors have innovatively introduced a method to assign weights to the transition of features in layers of the network.This results in generating an activation output for each node and feature in the graph.It allows the weights to be determined by the data itself.The importance of this research is highlighted by its approach, to resolving the challenge of learning kernels from graph labels—a topic that has not received attention in current literature. The paper could be clearer in defining and explaining the power spectrum P∗ and the hop, for readers who might find these concepts unfamiliar. Fortunately the experimental section offers enlightening information that gives valuable insights.
