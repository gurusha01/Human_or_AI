The authors suggest estimating the cluster tree related to the density of a provided sample by using the cluster tree from a kernel density estimator as a reference point for accuracy evaluation using the sup norm of the underlying density. Which is a standard metric, for clustering tree comparison. The researchers use a bootstrap method to create confidence intervals and propose a technique to pinpoint a tree from these intervals that displays a straightforward layout, than the cluster tree of the kernel density estimator while maintaining important topological characteristics They present findings from experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets.  
The article is interesting and informative overall. The main finding is a bit underwhelming on closer inspection.The introduction hints that by estimating the cluster tree of the density itself can overcome dimensionality issues; however the authors do not provide any assurances regarding the accuracy of the estimator.In practice the estimation is done for $Tp_{ph}$ using a small bandwidth $ h$, rather than for $Tp_{po}$.To obtain a proper estimate for $Tp_{po}$ the bandwidth $ h $ needs to be smaller, than a certain unknown threshold value $ h_o$ as mentioned in line 192. As a result of this issue not being resolved yet 
The statement of Theorem 3 does not include a proof and surprisingly does not rely on $ B $ at all. This raises some concerns. 
In my view point it would be best to take out any mentions of $ d_{MM}$ since they don't really add to the points of the paper.
