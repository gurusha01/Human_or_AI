This research utilizes the drift diffusion model which's a well regarded framework rooted in neuroscience to replicate the results of experiments involving making choices between two options in psychophysics and neuroscience fields.The process of decision making when faced with uncertainty is often described as an accumulation of evidence represented by a drift diffusion process that leads to a decision once a certain threshold is met.An important query emerges. What would be the threshold, for a specific problem? When looking at this issue from an angle by focusing on reducing the time it takes to make a decision and minimizing errors in decision making processes; the authors establish an ideal threshold that is then calculated using two different methods that treat optimization as a problem in reinforcement learning strategies.This study is praiseworthy; however its impact could be greatly amplified by applying it to real life data derived from animal research studies available online rather, than solely depending on artificial scenarios.Exploring how closely human actions match up with the concept of optimization would offer valuable insights. It would be very beneficial to evaluate how well people perform and the extent to which they do so in order to enhance the papers findings significantly.If the real world significance of exceeding this standard is shown it could greatly enhance the papers influence. Possibly result in a better evaluation.
