The document introduces a method for creating confidence intervals and p values when choosing sets of variables in various statistical techniques like forward selection and group lasso, among others.It tackles an issue of handling data that is utilized for both selecting groups and performing statistical evaluations by providing a detailed approach to assess their significance accurately. The uniqueness of this study lies in its capability to establish ranges of certainty of just computing p values for sets of variables, like earlier approaches did.The key breakthrough is based on a concept that explains how Gaussians are limited in their projections.  
The paper showcases two experiments conducted. One using artificial data and the other with actual data. To showcase the effectiveness of the method proposed in a clear and structured manner and offers a thorough overview of the issue at hand while effectively pointing out the new hurdles and contributions stemming from it; Nevertheless there are some sections that could benefit from additional information, for improved clarity and comprehension.  
From a perspective the paper seems solid; Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 make valuable contributions to the field of research presented here However some parts of the proofs may need further explanation for thoroughness and precision. The experimental segment is a beginning but lacks impact in some areas. Specifically the objective and conclusion of the experiment, in Section 4. 2 Require clarity. Additionally evaluating the suggested technique in contrast to methods like simply dividing the data could offer significant perspectives on its effectiveness and productivity particularly when dealing with the primary difficulty of employing identical data, for both group selection and inference. 
Multiple insightful remarks are worth mentioning. 
It would be helpful to have a conversation, about whether the groups are considered separate and distinct (creating a division).
Considering the option to expand on the method beyond using the quadratic loss or Gaussian model could open up intriguing paths, for future investigation. 
Condition (2), on the hand requires further elaboration to support its relevance. 
The first theorem would be improved by including information about the specific quantities being conditioned and the random variables associated with the probabilities, under consideration. 
We need to clarify the solution, for the equation \(\hat f Y ( L \alpha )= \alpha\) specified on line 252. 
Talking about how complex the approach's in various situations, like IHT and group lasso would be really helpful and interesting to explore. 
The purpose and findings of the experiment are unclear and need more explanation. 
The possible use of the suggested approach in methods to [A] and its contrast with a basic bootstrapping procedure, like [B] but tailored for group sparsity estimators pose fascinating inquiries. 
In the information provided should address the continuity of \( t \rightarrow fy(t)\) ensuring that \( L\) exists and offering more insights, into the properties of \( f_y \)' s proofs would be helpful.
