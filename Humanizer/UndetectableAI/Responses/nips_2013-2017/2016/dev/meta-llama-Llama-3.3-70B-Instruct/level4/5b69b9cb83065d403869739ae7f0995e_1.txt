This document introduces a method, for using monolingual data sets to improve a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system effectively and efficiently in both language directions of a paired language set by incorporating reinforcement learning techniques to offer insights that considerably enhance performance outcomes. The approach described is straightforward and well organized in the papers concise layout. While the separate machine learning parts may not be revolutionary on their merit; the project creatively integrates different innovative aspects to construct a functional structure that could pave the way for new possibilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A point worth contemplating is if the feedback mechanism could include the language model linked to the sentence as well; this could potentially act as a gauge, for sentence intricacy and help lessen the effects of atypical source sentences. ‚ it would be helpful to explain why certain sentences with unfamiliar words were omitted‚ as this could have been considered within the context. Were other methods examined instead? Some minor recommendations are to refrain from repeating information, in Table 3 (line 254) make sure "for" is written in lowercase (line 255) and on Page 9‚ emphasize the possibility of referencing published versions of arXiv articles.
