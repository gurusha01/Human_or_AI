I cannot proceed with the task as you have not provided the text you want me to paraphrase. Could you please share the text so I can work on providing a like rewrite?This paper delves into the idea of choosing subsets causally using directed information by maximizing a submodular or close to submodular method for selecting features for prediction purposes.The introduction of an explanation of approximate submodularity and the consequent approximations is a significant highlight of this study.However the manuscript raises two issues.Firstly the exploration of using information for causality is questionable due, to the dual interpretation of causality. The term "causality" can have meanings. It could be about predicting a sequence of events using existing data while considering the order in which they occur (referred to as "causal") or it might involve studying hypothetical scenarios and the relationships between variables to uncover how data is created at its core. The study focuses on the interpretation similar, to generalized Granger causality or prediction causality seen in recent research like [20]. Understanding the importance of clarifying that accurate time series prediction does not necessarily offer an understanding of how altering one time series impacts another underscores the difference, between prediction and actual causation.  
The paper presents intriguing findings related to submodularity and its applications in approximating near submodular functions using Granger causality as an example scenario highlighting more prominently by the authors and citing relevant studies like those of Pearls or Imbens, for non. Granger causality aspects. The second theorem unveils a discovery supported by a sound proof; meanwhile Lemma 1 (referred to as Lemma 2 in the appendix) plays a vital role in illustrating the relaxation of submodularity with a lucid proof provided as well.Thorem 3 and its subsequent corollaries stand out as the compelling outcomes as they introduce a fresh relaxation of submodularity that is not contingent upon causality or information metrics—this aspect deserves special attention. 
The other concern relates to the research conducted by Das and Kempe in [reference] where they introduced a modification of submodularity referred to as the submodularity ratio.The recent paper incorrectly mentions that this concept was only established for the R² score by [reference]. In fact [reference]s work defines the submodularity ratio for any function and later tailors it specifically, for the R² score. Moreover the assurance of performance that extends the result in Theorem 4 of the cited source is relevant for any function with a limited submodularity ratio. A point that seems to be downplayed in said source. A crucial inquiry arises about whether certain findings in this document follow from Theorem 4 in the reference considering the resemblance, between the Submodularity metric introduced here and the submodularity ratio described in that source. The two ideas basically describe the comparison between adding items versus adding them all together. Submodularity suggests a difference that's more than zero (or a ratio that is equal, to 1). The relaxation discussed in [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) requires a submodularity ratio that's equal or greater than a specific constant gamma value which bears resemblance with the near zero negative SMI difference in this paper; furthermore indicating a tendency towards standardizing SMI divided by f(S_greedy). This observation hints at a direct correlation between the outcomes detailed in [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) for general set functions and the findings presented here. Delving into this analysis can be intricate, as [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) solely delves into functions while our study encompasses both monotone and non monotone functions possibly extending the findings of [reference 1](https;//www.referenceurl.com) beyond just monotonicity. 
Some minor suggestions include fixing the author order in reference [3] providing explanations for Propositions 2 and 3 proofs and correcting various typos and grammar mistakes in the document such as changing "Consider two random process X^n (processes)" to "Consider two random processes X^n " substituting "directed information maximization > maximization problems " replacing "address in details > in detail " switching "any polynomial algorithm > polynomial time algorithm " and ensuring a consistent usage of "monotone'' instead of "monotonic'', for submodular functions. While there are some issues to address the findings, in optimization are quite interesting; therefore I suggest accepting the paper with the required revisions.
