This paper introduces a method for developing hierarchical policy models based on demonstrated behaviors in basketball playing scenarios using deep neural networks and an attention mechanism to merge overarching goals and detailed actions.Vwhile the research objective is interesting the current version of the manuscript may pose challenges in understanding. Assessing it by reviewers like me who have a background, in reinforcement learning (RL) but are not deep learning specialists. The methodology part is a bit hard to understand in section 4 because some terms and symbols like the L in Equation 5 seem unclear. It seems to stand for loss but isn't clearly explained. Moreover; this work doesn’t give background from previous research or compare itself to other methods. It's interesting that they didn’t mention or discuss studies, by George Konidaris and Sanjoy Krishnan about learning skills or macro actions from demos. I recommend that the authors enhance the manuscript through revisions and resubmission by adding thorough explanations and placing their work in the context of existing literature. They should also consider referencing research such as Konidaris et al.' work on building skill trees from demonstrations. Niekum et al.' s study, on mastering tasks from unstructured demonstrations. Furthermore the authors need to clarify the origin of labels practically since it is not clearly explained in the current version of the manuscript. Citing research studies, like the one conducted by Han et al on developing complex multi step controllers and the study done b Mural et al on identifying patterns in diverse surgical demonstrations without supervision would add more depth and credibility to the paper.
