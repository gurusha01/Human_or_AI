This study introduces a method for addressing random sets of quadratic equations in signal processing tasks related to phase retrieval issues—a significant problem area within the field.The strategy described in this research follows a structure seen in past methods, like the truncated Wirtinger flow algorithm and involves two main phases; an initial setup phase and a subsequent iterative improvement process. The authors have put forward a method for initializing orthogonality that avoids the limitations of spectral methods relying on heavy tailed distributions – this novel approach has shown clear superiority, in empirical studies compared to previous methods used.  
The paper suggests using a truncated generalized gradient algorithm to improve the initial estimation of a cost function based on amplitudes instead of intensity levels by refining the solution further in a non smooth and non linear manner rather than using intensity based methods from the start.The authors conduct an analysis of the algorithms convergence to the accurate solution with exponential speed, under Gaussian design assumptions when the initial approximation is precise enough. From what I understand the key point of the argument depends on a perspective that shows how a careful adjustment of certain gradient elements stops the algorithm from veering off track towards incorrect paths while searching.  
Based on research findings cited in the study paper indicate that the new algorithm performs better than existing ones and greatly cuts down on the number of equations needed to address the issue. Which brings us closer to the necessary number of equations for information theory purposes. The paper is well organized and straightforward to grasp away. Even though I wasn't too familiar with the problem initially. Thanks to the background details and links, to previous findings outlined in the paper really helped me grasp why this new algorithm was proposed. The analysis and findings are quite compelling; as someone, with phase retrieval issues myself I think the outcomes outlined in the paper could significantly influence upcoming research in this area provided that the authors trustworthiness holds up. 
Some small concerns were identified. 
It looks like "for an enough step size" could be a better fit, at line 133. 
In line 152 of the code snippet you provided it seems like variable z is lacking a subscript, for the time index t. 
Equation 9 would benefit from an explanation of the variable h to avoid any confusion, in its current form.
