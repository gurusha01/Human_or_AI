This study explores the process of animals acquiring decision thresholds in tasks involving decision making as outlined by the drift diffusion model (DDM). Two strategies are suggested by the authors to improve decision thresholds – one involves using a reinforcement learning technique inspired by Williams’ REINFORCE algorithm while the other employs optimization with Gaussian processes.The goal of both approaches is to enhance single trial rewards based on Wald’s cost functions which presents an optimization dilemma due, to the random nature of rewards. The authors test their approaches through optimization and assess their effectiveness based on speed of progress convergence and computational expenses alongside variance analysis too.They also delve into the feasibility of REINFORCE as a framework for animal learning by drawing parallels with real world data from studies, on rodents and bats. 
The study expands on research in decision making by incorporating concepts from Ratcliffs DDM and Walds SPRT models and linking reinforcement learning to optimal decision making structures. The REINFORCE technique is based on policy gradient strategies while Bayesian optimization uses modeling to assist in threshold determination. The authors introduce an approach, by implementing these techniques to address the issue of threshold learning in DDMs and showcasing their effectiveness through comprehensive simulations. 
Advantages; 
The research focuses on an aspect of neuroscience. The process of acquiring decision thresholds. Through the integration of reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization methods that connect machine learning with biological decision making processes. 
The authors thoroughly assess the two techniques using criteria, like speed of convergence and computational expenses and confirm their findings through extensive optimization validation. 
Biological credibility is evident in the REINFORCE technique as it corresponds closely with data from animal behavior studies and mirrors models of brain plasticity in the cortico striatal region which increases its significance, in the field of neuroscience. 
The paper is nicely structured with to follow descriptions of the methods used and the results obtained along with their significance and implications illustrated through figures that effectively highlight key discoveries. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The high computational expense and variability of optimization can hinder its practical use, in solving large scale problems despite its quicker convergence speed. 
While the REINFORCE method shows some similarities to animal learning patterns based on biological evidence provided in the data analysis process; it is suggested that conducting quantitative validation using actual experimental data would provide more robust support, for the assertions made in this context. 
"Simply put it assumes fixed decision points and starting points which might not be applicable, to situations involving more intricate or changing decision processes."
Scalability is touched upon in the paper mentioning the potential to apply the methods to decisions involving alternatives although no specific results or detailed analysis are presented for such situations. 
Reasons supporting approval; 
The article discusses an issue that has not been thoroughly examined incorporating creative approaches to tackle it. 
"It is backed by a theoretical basis and has been extensively validated through real world experiments."
The REINFORCE technique holds implications for gaining insights, into biological mechanisms of learning. 
Reasons to not agree; 
The practical usefulness of optimization is constrained by its computational inefficiency. 
Further quantitative validation is needed to establish the significance of the REINFORCE method. 
Suggestion; 
My suggestion is to accept the paper with some tweaks needed for improvement. It adds insights, to the fields of machine learning and neuroscience. Enhancing its impact could be achieved by overcoming the constraints related to Bayesian optimization and bolstering the biological validation process.
