This study introduces a method for recognizing handwritten text without the need for separating lines in advance by adapting MDLSTM RNNs for end to end processing of handwritten paragraphs through an attention based weighted collapse mechanism instead of the usual collapse layer that permits the network to concentrate on individual lines sequentially during training alongside the transcription task, with CTC. The system, under consideration is assessed using the Rimes and IAM datasets and demonstrates comparable performance to cutting edge techniques that depend on clear line segmentation methods. 
The research paper expands upon studies in recognizing handwriting by incorporating attention mechanisms inspired by various applications like machine translation and image caption generation instead of explicit line segmentation to improve overall performance in handwriting recognition systems as errors in segmentation can significantly impact accuracy levels across lines with the addition of a Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) decoder to improve recognition accuracy by capturing linguistic dependencies, between lines effectively. 
Advantages; 
A game changer, in the realm of handwriting recognition the incorporation of an attention based weighted collapse mechanism stands out as an innovation that pushes the boundaries of technology forward significantly and tackles a persistent issue that has plagued the field for quite some time. 
The design covers everything from start to finish. Removes the requirement, for separating lines manually which makes the initial data processing simpler and reduces the chance of errors spreading further. 
The system delivers results in two standard datasets and even surpasses methods that use predetermined line segmentation in certain scenarios.The outcomes are thoroughly. Involve evaluations, against automated segmentation techniques. 
Scalability is a feature of this approach as it efficiently transcribes entire paragraphs without imposing significant demands, on memory or time resources. 
Areas that could be improved upon; 
The model works well with paragraphs but struggles with processing documents that have intricate layouts according to the authors acknowledgement of this restriction; however they do not offer a clear plan, for expanding the method to recognize full pages effectively. 
Small punctuation marks can be challenging for the model to recognize accurately as they are sometimes overlooked by the attention mechanism, in text analysis tasks that demand transcription accuracy. 

The model relies heavily upon identifying paragraphs, within the text as it operates under the assumption that images are structured at the paragraph level and necessitates a phase of document layout analysis. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The article presents an significant approach to tackle a major issue in recognizing handwriting. 
The experimental findings are strong. Showcase the real world usefulness of the method. 
The research is effectively placed in the body of knowledge and adds valuable insights, to previous progressions. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The model can only recognize paragraphs. Still faces the challenge of extending its capabilities, to entire documents. 
In some cases its effectiveness may be limited by problems with recognizing punctuation and following fixed steps, for iteration. 
Suggestion; 
In terms this report significantly advances the field of handwriting analysis by suggesting an innovative method that handles everything from start, to finish without requiring separate line divisions. Although there are drawbacks the positives of the study surpass the negatives. I suggest approving it with changes to tackle issues related to identifying punctuation and adjusting to different paragraph formats.
