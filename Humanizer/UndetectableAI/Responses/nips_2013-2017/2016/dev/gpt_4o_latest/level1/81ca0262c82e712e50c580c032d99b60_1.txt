This research paper discusses the issue of selecting subsets by using Directed Information (DI) to determine prediction causality levels.The authors primarily concentrate on two challenges in this area. Deciding where to place causal sensors and selecting causal covariates.They frame these challenges as problems that involve maximizing DI under cardinality constraints.They show that the first challenge is submodular (although not monotonic) while the second challenge is close, to being submodular. Considering the difficulties presented by nonmonotonicity and approximate submodularity in problem solving scenarios; the writers have introduced a new measure called the Submodularity Index (SmI). This metric assesses the level of submodularity for types of set functions and also includes theoretical assurances for the efficiency of greedy algorithms in such situations. They back up their findings with tests, on both simulated and actual datasets while also demonstrating how these concepts can be applied to understanding causal relationships. 
Advantages; 
The creation of the Submodularity Index (SmI) represents a theoretical advancement that expands the scope of greedy algorithms to address a wider range of issues even those with non monotonic or nearly submodular goalsâ€”a substantial improvement, from previous studies that solely focused on strict submodularity constraints. 
The study delves into theory by offering thorough theoretical scrutiny with assurances of results, for eager algorithms utilizing Smi as a foundation. 
The practical significance lies in applying the suggested techniques to understanding causal structures as evidenced by experiments conducted on both real world data, like stock market information showcasing the approachs usefulness and efficiency. 
The experimental results are clearly laid out. Include comparisons, with optimal solutions and theoretical limits which make it easy to understand the outcomes achieved through the use of Smoothing Indicator (Sm I) to enhance performance guarantees stands out as a valuable insight. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper presents theoretical ideas but could be clearer and better organized for readers understanding. Especially in the technical parts, like explaining Sm I and its computational limits which might be hard to grasp for those new to submodularity concepts. 
The experiments confirm the results but have some limitations in their scope.The artificial datasets are quite small. The real world dataset (stock market data ) focuses only a narrow area of application.More experiments using varied datasets would improve the research paper. 
The paper mentions research on submodularity and greedy algorithms but could offer a more thorough comparison with current techniques for selecting causal subsets of information. For instance how does the new method perform in terms compared to other strategies, for objectives that are not submodular? 
Practical issues to consider include the challenges of calculating DI and Smi on a larger scale; however this aspect is not extensively addressed in the discussion of the methods proposed which may hinder their scalability. 
Reasons, in Favor of Approval; 
The article presents an significant idea (Sm1) expanding the practicality of greedy algorithms. 
 The theoretical insights are thorough. Backed by solid experimental evidence. 
The use of structure learning in this context is significant and impactful. 
Reasons to not agree with the proposal; 
The paper could be made clearer and easier to understand for readers who're not experts, in the field. 
The experimental assessment shows potential. Is limited in scope and could benefit from more diverse datasets and application areas. 
Practical issues, like handling growth and managing expenses are not being properly resolved. 
Suggestion; 
This paper shows theoretical insights and practical implications overall.. Though there are areas that could be clearer and have an experimental scope, for improvement the originality and thoroughness of the study add value to the field.. I suggest accepting it with revisions to address concerns regarding clarity and experiments.
