This paper discusses the challenges of dealing with partial monitoring games (CPM) where a learner navigates through a vast array of actions and receives limited feedback while the opponent selects moves, from a continuous and restricted space. Expanding on research by [Author 01] who first introduced the CPM model and suggested the Global Confidence Bound (GCB) this study presents two significant findings; (a). The creation of the Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) a framework that enhances regret bounds with computational demands; and (b). The unveiling of the PEGS algorithm which maintains assurances, like GCB but without being influenced by the learners action space size. The paper also shows how these algorithms can be used in real world situations like online ranking when feedback is only allowed for ranked items. 
The new framework called the Performance Enhanced Gaming Environment (PEGE for short) represents an improvement over the previous GCB model by achieving a regret bound that is not dependent on distribution with \( O(T^{ 23 } \sqrt{\log(T)}) \) and a distribution dependent regret bound of \( O(\log(T))^ { 21 } \). Unlike GCB that requires an "arg secondmax" oracle which's computationally intensive; howeverm, in contrast P EGE only needs an "argmax" oracle making it more efficient to use. Moreover P EGEs distribution dependent regret does not hinge on the presence of a best action addressing one of the drawbacks of GCB. The PEG E ‚ÇÇ algorithm enhances this method by blending gap estimation, with PEG E ‚ÇÇ to achieve an \( O(\log{T}) \\) loss limit while not being affected by the magnitude of the learners action space. 
Advantages; 
The paper presents algorithms that enhance GCB in terms of computational efficiency and real world relevance with regret bounds rigorously derived and supported by theoretical analysis. 
The real world significance is shown in the context of ranking to highlight how the suggested techniques are beneficial in situations, with sparse feedback and extensive or endless options available. 
The paper is nicely laid out with to understand descriptions of the CPM model and its assumptions and detailed algorithmic explanations.The thorough comparison, to GCB effectively showcases the benefits of the suggested approaches. 
Areas, for improvement; 
When using PEGED knowing the time horizon \(t\) is essential which might not be suitable for situations where \(t\) is uncertain, unlike the flexible nature of GCB that can adapt anytime. 
The complexity of estimating the gap, in PEGEE is a challenge despite its regret bounds and may require careful parameter adjustments. 
The paper would benefit from including data to support the theoretical analysis presented, such as empirical comparisons, with GCB and other baseline models to bolster its arguments. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The paper adds theoretical insights to the CPM framework, by tackling important challenges that previous studies overlooked. 
The suggested methods are effective, in terms of computer processing. Can be used for a wider array of issues that also involve countless action possibilities. 
The project is strategically placed in the existing body of work by expanding on and taking forward findings, in CPM and bandit theory. 
Reasons not to agree; 

PEGylated EGFs effectiveness in some scenarios may be restricted due to its reliance, on temperature \( *temperature \; denoted \; by \; the \; symbol \; \( * * ‚Å¢ùëá\).
Recommendation to approve with revisions is given for the papers valuable contributions to CPM games field; however incorporating experimental findings and addressing the reliance, on \( T \) would boost its significance even more.
