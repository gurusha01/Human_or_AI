This study introduces a neural network design for solving visual question answering (VQA) where the questions are continually refined by analyzing different parts of the image in a step by step manner.The proposed model utilizes a network that reasons through multiple layers and uses attention mechanisms to focus on significant areas within the image.The structure combines trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which interpret the images with gated recurrent units (GRUs) responsible, for encoding the questions.The effectiveness of the model is tested on two datasets—COCO QS and VQA—showing outstanding performance compared to existing approaches. 
The article expands on research in Visual Question Answer (VQA) leveraging attention based models [28 and 29] as well as neural reasoning systems [18]. It also tackles the shortcomings of image representations by integrating object proposals into its framework. This strategy is in line with developments in multimodal learning that emphasize the utilization of attention mechanisms [27 and 3] along, with object focused reasoning [20]. The authors also mention studies in image description [10 and 24] well, as answering questions based on text [22] placing their findings in the wider landscape of neural reasoning and multimodal learning. 
Advantages; 
Innovation in Technology; A notable advancement is seen in the refinement of question representations across reasoning layers which showcases better synchronization, between visual and textual elements.The incorporation of object proposals and spatial features boosts the models capacity to analyze visual connections. 
Cutting edge Achievements; The model surpasses techniques like SAN [29] and methods based on object proposals [20] across COCO Q&A and VQA datasets alike. The thorough analysis confirms the success of elements such, as weighted pooling and attention mechanisms. 
The paper is nicely organized with descriptions of how the model works and the setup, for experiments and evaluating results is explained well too. 

Areas, for improvement; 
The model finds it challenging to engage in reasoning according to the experiments conducted on questions related to numbers. While this issue is recognized it is not completely resolved, indicating the potential for enhancements, in research efforts. 
The model shows performance on COCO Question Answering (COCOA) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets; however; its ability to adapt to different datasets or real life situations, with varied visual and language inputs has not been investigated yet. 
Computational complexity may rise due to the use of object proposals and multiple layers of reasoning in AI systems. This might hinder scalability, for extensive applications. 
The paper doesn't delve into the theory behind why the suggested reasoning mechanism's better than current methods, in a profound way and doesn't fully explain some aspects of its success. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted as it contributes significantly to the VQA field by improving performance and introducing a reasoning framework that is innovative and inspiring for further research in multimodal reasoning and attention based models despite some weaknesses, in counting and generalization that could be addressed to enhance the work.
