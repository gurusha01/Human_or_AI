The paper presents a method for solving random quadratic equation systems in signal processing known as phase retrieval problems. A crucial issue tackled by the algorithm introduced in the study by employing two main stages; an initial setup phase and successive enhancement of the solution akin to other algorithms such, as the truncated Wirtinger flow algorithm. In contrast to the initialization techniques used in previous studies the authors introduce a fresh initiative that promotes orthogonality steering clear of the known constraints associated with spectral methods reliant on heavy tailed distributed variables. The practical findings undeniably showcase the effectiveness of this approach to initialization in comparison, to past methodologies.  
Expanding from the starting estimate mentioned earlier in the papers context is a truncated generalized gradient method that aims to reduce a non concave and non smooth cost function based on amplitude (instead of intensity) enhancing the outcome through successive adjustments. Assuming a design framework enables the authors to present a detailed examination verifying that the method approaches the right solution rapidly on an exponential scale when the initial estimate is adequately precise. It seems that the proof relies on an idea that explains how a well thought out adjustment of the gradient elements can stop the algorithm from getting off track towards incorrect directions while optimizing the process. Based on findings the new method performs better than existing ones and notably cuts down on the equations needed to solve the problem bringing us closer to reaching the information theoretic limit, on equation quantities. 
The document is nicely. Easy to understand. Even though I wasn't familiar with this issue before the background information and references to previous research in the document really helped me understand why the suggested algorithm was created. The theoretical examination and impressive real world results are convincing. As someone who isn't well acquainted with phase retrieval while trusting the authorsâ€™ credibility I think this work will make a strong mark, in shaping future studies in this area. 
There are a small problems. 
"Should it say 'for an enough step size', in line 133?"  
"Hey there! Did they forget to include the 't' subscript, for 'z' in line 152?"  
Could you please provide a definition, for h in equation 9 since its current representation seems a bit vague?
