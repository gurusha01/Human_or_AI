Drift diffusion models have been widely accepted in the field of neuroscience for simulating the results of decision making tasks involving two choices, in psychophysics and neuroscience research settings. In situations where decisions are made under uncertainty a process of accumulating evidence (known as drift diffusion process) leads to a decision once a certain threshold is met. Determining the threshold for a specific issue involves considering both minimizing the time taken to make a decision and reducing errors in decision making strategies. The limit is calculated afterward using two methods that treat the optimization as a reinforcement learning challenge.The task is well done and praiseworthy.However I suggest to the authors to test their approach using human or animal data (easily accessible online),rather than depending solely on artificial examples.How effective are humans, in achieving the possible outcome is there any comparison to be made here? Addressing this question would greatly improve the papers significance. Would make me think about upgrading its rating.
