The writers discuss the problem of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM). In this setup in each round a vector Θ is selected from a distribution that is fixed but unknown. The operator picks an arm from a set that could be endless and earns a reward based on a known function of the chosen arm and Θ. However of seeing the reward or the complete vector Θ the operator gets an arm specific linear transformation of Θ and strives to minimize regret. The writers suggest an algorithm utilizing the Phased Exploration and Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) methodolgy.The strategy involves transitioning between stages of exploration and selective exploitation with fixed durations for each phase.They also present a modified version of this algorithm which includes a phase to assess the difference.The authors offer evaluations for both procedures determining regret bounds that are specific to the problem at hand as well as those that are general, across problems. These limits show a relationship with T as previous studies but are not influenced by the number of arms and do not need the assumption of a single optimal arm, for the problem independent limit to hold true.A example illustrating this concept is also provided in the paper within the context of online ranking.  
The paper is nicely written and well laid out with an utilization of the PEGE framework to remove reliance upon the quantity of arms and the distribution of samples for enhancing problem specific regret bounds—these are standout contributions worth acknowledging in this study review request I endorse accepting this manuscript Nonetheless I do have some queries, for the writers;  
You haven't mentioned anything about regret bounds in your discussion regarding the stochastic CPM problems lower bounds. Do you know of any established bounds, for the stochastic CPM problem and how do they stack up against your findings?   
You haven't mentioned how the global observable set is chosen in detail Is there an approach, to selecting the global observable set σ so that βσ is reduced to a minimum level?   
After considering the authors’ response I have decided to stick with my scores.
