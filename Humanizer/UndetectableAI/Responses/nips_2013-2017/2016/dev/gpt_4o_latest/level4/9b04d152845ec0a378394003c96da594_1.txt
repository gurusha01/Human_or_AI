This study combines a network structure resembling networks with the fusion of language and visual features to tackle the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task successfully based on results from established benchmarks that show significant improvement in performance levels achieved by prior works in this field even though the originality of the approach is somewhat restricted in scope but accepting this research could pave the way for future developments as researchers can use these findings as a foundation to enhance existing accomplishments, in this area. The study integrates a residual style structure with fusion for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and an important advancement is the incorporation of multiplicative interactions to blend visual features and word embeddings together successfully. The outcomes presented exceed the best performance, by a considerable margin; nonetheless the usage of several pre trained models and embeddings necessitates a more comprehensive evaluation of their specific impacts. ‚ it's best to refrain from citing equations from external sources. Instead‚ consider including them directly in this paper for clarity and context.' Regarding Section 5‚ what would be the impact of using sigmoid(W_q*q ) as the mask, for visualization purposes?'
