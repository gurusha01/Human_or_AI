The research paper presents a technique for creating confidence intervals and p values to choose sets of variables collectively in a study context that covers methods like forward selection and group lasso as showcased instances, within the research work itself.This paper tackles an issue involving utilizing identical data for both selecting groups of covariates and evaluating their significance statistically. The unique aspect of this research lies in its capability to create intervals of confidence of solely focusing on p values which was common in previous approaches, for sets of variables.The innovation is based on a lemma that describes how truncated projections of Gaussian variables are distributed.The study entails two experiments—one conducted using synthetic data and another using real world data. 
The paper is nicely. Well explained overall with a solid introduction to the issue at hand and a clear presentation of the challenges and innovations (for example in lines 103 to 105). HoweverI feel that adding some information, in certain areas would improve the clarity of the presentation as I will explain further below. 
The technical aspects of the report seem grounded as Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 make notable and valuable contributions; however some parts of the explanations need more clarity (refer to the specific comments provided).
In the experiments section of the report could be enhanced to make it more engaging and clear to the readers.For example in Section 4..we found that the purpose and outcomes of the experiment are not well defined.Adding comparisons and debates, with other methods would make the experimental analysis stronger. For instance because the main difficulty of this task lies in managing the dataset for selecting groups and making statistical inferences it might be useful to contrast the suggested approach, with a more straightforward technique that divides the data even if this approach is anticipated to lower both model selection precision and inference capabilities. 
I appreciate the feedback provided. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. Your insights are truly valuable.
It would be beneficial to clarify at the beginning of the document whether the groups are considered to create a partition (that's whether overlaps are permitted).
It would be interesting to explore how the methodology could be expanded beyond loss (or the Gaussian model).
Condition (i); Could you explain further why this specific quantity is the relevant to consider in this context? 
In 1,it would be helpful to include additional information regarding the specific quantities that are being conditioned upon and the random variables for which probabilities are being calculated. 
How would one go about solving the solution, for the equation \(\hat { f Y } ( L \alpha ) = \alpha\) as mentioned on line 252?
It would be helpful to talk about how complex the proposed method's in various situations, like IHT and group lasso. 
The aim and conclusion of the experiment (Section 4 Part 3) need clarification, for better understanding. 
Would it be possible to use the suggested method on practices to the ones mentioned in [reference a]? Also how does the suggested strategy stack up against a direct bootstrap approach (, like [reference b] but adjusted for group sparsity estimates)?
Additional Resources; 
At the start of proving Theorem 1. Do we also have to confirm the smoothness of \(f(y(t))\) for \( L \alpha \)s existence?
More information is needed on the evidence supporting the characteristics of \( f_y \) including how it behaves in situations and whether it always increases or decreases consistently.
