This research paper presents a technique for utilizing datasets to improve the performance of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model effectively by incorporating reinforcement learning to offer guidance to two NMT systems that handle translation in both directions of a language pair individually. The method is elucidated with clarity. Showcases substantial enhancements in performance metrics. While the study does not introduce groundbreaking concepts in machine learning per se it adeptly merges innovations to establish a strong foundation that may lead to new possibilities, in the field of natural language processing.  
I have a suggestion regarding the feedback feature. Is it possible to include the language model used for the sentence in the feedback function as well? I am not sure how to execute this idea but it could indicate the complexity of the sentence and help tailor the feedback for difficult sentences. Also can you explain why sentences, with words are removed? This seems like something that can be addressed within your system. Have you considered methods to tackle this issue? 
I have some remarks.
Please provide the input text that you would like me to paraphrase.
The word "for" should be, in lowercase. 
On page 9 of your research papers, on arxiv.org (arxiv) it is recommended to reference the published versions of the papers whenever.
