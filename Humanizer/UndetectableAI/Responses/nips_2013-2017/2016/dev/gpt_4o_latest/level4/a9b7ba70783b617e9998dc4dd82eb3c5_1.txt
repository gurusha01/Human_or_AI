The authors goal is to predict the cluster structure of a distribution using a given sample data set.The method they suggest is linked to the cluster structure obtained from a kernel density estimation process.The effectiveness of this method is evaluated in relation to the deviation of the original distribution and is shown to be consistent, with a common measurement used for comparing clustering structures.To measure the level of uncertainty involved the authors suggest using confidence intervals generated through a bootstrap technique. Moreover they propose a technique to pinpoint a tree from these confidence sets that exhibits a complex structure, than the cluster tree generated by the kernel density estimator while maintaining essential topological characteristics. They showcase findings utilizing both fabricated and actual datasets.   
The document is nicely crafted and interesting, with content for the readers benefit; nonetheless the main outcome falls short of expectations in some aspects. The introduction suggests that determining the cluster tree as opposed to the density helps alleviate the curse of dimensionality but lacks formal assurances regarding the accuracy of their estimation method. In particular they do not directly estimate \( T_{p_0}\) opting for \(T_{ph}\) wherein \(h\) represents a small yet arbitrary bandwidth value. In order to accurately estimate \( T_{\text{{opt}}} \) the value of \( h \)\( must be kept small (below a certain threshold \( h_{\text{{opt}}} \) as indicated in line 192). This means that the issue of dimensionality cannot be completely avoided.   
In Theorem 3 where the proof is missing I find it unexpected that there is no mention of any connection, to \( B \).  
I believe that it's best to eliminate any mentions of \( d_{MM}\).
