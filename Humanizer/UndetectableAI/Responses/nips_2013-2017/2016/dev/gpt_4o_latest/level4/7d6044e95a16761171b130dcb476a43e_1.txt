The writers suggest a group of models based on probabilities that combine structured distributions in the form of graphical models with complex observation models carried out using neural networks. Stating that these two approaches have different but complementary advantages. Their goal is to make use of the to understand nature and effective inference methods of graphical models along with the capacity, for representation learning found in neural networks. The main focus of the study is a stochastic variational inference technique designed for teaching these hybrid models efficiently. This method uses a recognition model that is designed as a network to tackle the non conjugate observation model and facilitate effective mean field updates for deducing the local hidden variables.  
The experimental part is quite limited as it only showcases findings on a synthetic dataset and a small dataset of low resolution videos. The idea of using a recognition model to estimate conjugacy as a stand in objective for deducing local latent variables is both compelling and noteworthy. Nevertheless it appears that this method is not as straightforward as the autoencoder (VAE) framework where the recognition model directly defines the variational posterior. A comparison of these two approaches along, with an examination of their strengths and weaknesses would have added value to the discussion.  
In terms the paper is nicely written but some parts are a bit heavy and need more details explaining things further.The extra information provided played a role in clearing up any uncertainties from the main text.Although the experiment part is brief and lacks results I don't think it's a big issue for a paper, with such innovative ideas.However the section discussing studies fails to mention recent papers focusing on sequence modeling within the VAE framework and the significant contributions of Titsias and Lazaro Gredilla [1]. 
Here are some sources, for information.  
The research paper titled "Doubly Stochastic Variational Bayes, for Non Conjugate Inference" was authored by M.K Titsias and M.Lazaro Gredilla in 2014 for the ICML conference.
