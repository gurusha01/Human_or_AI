This study combines graph kernels with a diffusion based convolutional neural network approach to enhance learning capabilities in handling graph data more effectively and efficiently without manual intervention in weight assignment for different layers and features based on the hop transitions within the network structure itself rather than relying on predetermined values or rules, for graph kernel learning from labeled data sets as seen in previous studies. The paper could use some improvement in terms of clarity since the explanations of the power spectrum P star. The hop are a bit vague for easy understanding by readers who are not experts, in the field of study. While I think I grasp the methodology presented in the paper enough to make sense of it myself I can see how an average reader might find it challenging to navigate through these uncertainties. On a note the experiments conducted in the paper are extensive and offer valuable insights into the subject matter.
