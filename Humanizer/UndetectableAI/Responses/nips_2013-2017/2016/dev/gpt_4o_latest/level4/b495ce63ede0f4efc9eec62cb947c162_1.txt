This research paper presents a technique in deep learning to create connections between pairs of images using a fully convolutional network (FCN). The authors incorporate a correspondence contrastive loss and an active hard negative mining strategy into their model design.The success of this method is validated through experiments conducted across publicly accessible datasets.The procedures are clearly. The outcomes are quite convincing.Adding insights, into the "semantic" aspect of this methodology would further improve its quality.
