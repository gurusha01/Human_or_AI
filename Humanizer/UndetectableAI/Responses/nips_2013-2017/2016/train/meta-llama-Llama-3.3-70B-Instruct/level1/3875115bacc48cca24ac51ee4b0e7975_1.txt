This article discusses two discoveries, about the probability distribution of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) each containing at least three components.The initial finding reveals that the probability distribution can contain peaks in certain scenarios involving equally weighted mixtures of distinct and spherical Gaussians.This answers a lingering query posed by Srebro [2007] shedding light on how this impacts the application of the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The second outcome shows that the EM algorithm or its first order version will likely reach critical points when starting randomly â€“ emphasizing the need, for precise initialization. 
The paper is nicely written and well structured; it offers an overview of the issues background and rationale in a clear manner. The authors thoroughly examine the population likelihood function and the EM algorithm while their proofs introduce methods, for discussing the structure of the population log likelihood. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
By resolving a lingering question in the field with practical implications, for the application of the EM algorithm. 
The new methods, for examining the likelihood of a populations data could also work well with non linear optimization challenges. 
The results are presented clearly and thoroughly in a way that can be easily understood by an audience. 
The paper has some drawbacks such, as; 
The idea of combining weighted mixtures of well separated and spherical Gaussians may not always reflect the reality in various practical scenarios. 
The absence of data to confirm the theoretical discoveries is a hindrance, in underlining the significance of precise initialization procedures. 
The paper excels, in meeting the review criteria.
The paper is solid, in terms of content and the arguments are backed by thorough theoretical analysis. 
The paper presents methods for examining the population log probability and addresses a longstanding inquiry, within the field. 
The findings carry importance for applying the EM algorithm in real world scenarios and underscore the significance of meticulous initial setup. 
However the paper doesn't perform well in the following areas; 
The paper is nicely written; however non experts might find some of the aspects hard to understand. 
In my opinion this paper should be approved for publication as it offers unique insights, in the area of machine learning and statistics.  
Points supporting acceptance; 
A lingering inquiry, in the domain has been resolved. 
Introducing methods, for examining the populations log probability calculations. 
The results were presented clearly and thoroughly. 
Reasons to agree; 
In scenarios the assumption of an evenly balanced combination of distinct and rounded Gaussians might not accurately reflect reality. 
There is a shortage of experimental data to confirm the theoretical discoveries.
