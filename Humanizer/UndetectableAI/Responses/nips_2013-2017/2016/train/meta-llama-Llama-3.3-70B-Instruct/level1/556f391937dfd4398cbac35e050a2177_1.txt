This research introduces a method for developing deep feature embeddings known as Position Based Deep Metric (PBDM) which adjusts to the specific feature arrangement in a diverse space setting. The authors suggest that the standard Euclidean distance measurement may not be ideal for identifying samples in intricate visual feature spaces. The PBDM module is crafted to acquire a similarity measurement that adjusts to the feature arrangement and aids, in choosing top tier challenging samples within a close vicinity to steer the development of deep embeddings. 
The article is nicely written with an explanation of their approach and a comprehensive overview of previous research provided by the authors. The papers technical advancements are substantial as they offer an, in depth explanation of their technique which includes the PDDM unit and the dual header hinge loss function. The experiments show how effective the suggested method is in image retrieval tasks and its ability to adapt to new categories in extensive and open scenarios, like transfer learning and zero shot learning.
