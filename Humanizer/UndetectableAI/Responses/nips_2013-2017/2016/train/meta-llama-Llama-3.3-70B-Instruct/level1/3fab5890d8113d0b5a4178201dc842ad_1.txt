The paper presents Sparse Access Memory (SAM) a type of neural memory design that allows for effective training of neural networks with extensive external memories.The authors tackle the issue of expanding memory augmented neural networks (MANNs) by introducing a method for sparse reading and writing that lowers the computational and memory load compared to conventional MANNs.The paper thoroughly examines the architectures theoretical basis through experiments and comparisons, with other models. 
The central themes of this paper revolve around studies on MANNs like Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and Memory Networks. They enhance these structures by introducing a sparse access mechanism that enhances efficiency and memory utilization. Furthermore the paper establishes links to research domains such, as attention mechanisms content based addressing and approximate nearest neighbor search. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
A new method of access has been introduced to facilitate the effective training of Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs), with extensive external memory capabilities. 
An, in depth examination of the basis of the suggested structures time and spatial intricacies is conducted. 
The proposed architectures effectiveness is showcased through assessments across various tasks such, as synthetic and natural language processing tasks. 
References to established models such, as NTMs and Memory Networks are made to showcase the benefits of the suggested framework. 
The papers shortcomings are as follows; 
The suggested design might need adjustment of hyperparameters, like the degree of sparsity and the selection of an approximate nearest neighbor search method.
