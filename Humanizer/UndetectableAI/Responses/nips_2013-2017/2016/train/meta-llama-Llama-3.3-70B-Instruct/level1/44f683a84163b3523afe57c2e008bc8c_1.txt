This paper suggests an approach called 3DGAN (Three Dimensional Generative Adversarial Network) to produce 3 dimensional objects from a probabilistic framework by utilizing the latest advancements in volumetric convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Additionally the study presents 3DVaeGAN as an expansion of 3DGAN to learn how to convert a 2 image into a 3 dimensional object. 
The core concepts discussed in this paper revolve around the exploration of 3 object creation and generation through the utilization of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors have built their 3 GAN framework by building off the research conducted by Goodfellow and Radford in 2014 and 2016 respectively as well as contrasting their outcomes with studies, by Wu and Girdhar from previous years. 
This paper excels in producing notch 3 dimensional shapes and introduces an innovative method for translating a 2 dimensional image into a 3 dimensional object successfully while displaying outstanding results in identifying 3 dimensional objects tasks effectively by the way it presents an elaborate examination of the acquired representations such as visual representations showing the object vector and neurons, in the discriminator. 
The papers limitations stem from its dependence on a dataset of 3 dimensional objects that might not be easily accessible for all uses. Furthermore the authors acknowledge the difficulty, in training the discriminator within their 3 GAN framework and address this by implementing an adaptive training approach to enhance the stability of the training process.
