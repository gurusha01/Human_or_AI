This paper introduces a method, for batch Bayesian optimization called the parallel knowledge gradient method (known as q KG). This method aims to optimize functions that are costly to evaluate by running multiple evaluations simultaneously. It is based on decision theory. Is proven to be optimal according to Bayes when trying to minimize the lowest prediction value of the Gaussian process with one last decision left. 
The paper discusses research that builds upon studies on Bayesian optimization by exploring the knowledge gradient method—a sequential Bayesian optimization approach—in a parallel setting where multiple points can be assessed concurrently. They extend the q KG algorithm to this context. Compare its performance with other parallel Bayesian optimization techniques, like parallel expected improvement (EI) and parallel upper confidence bound (UCB). The results demonstrate that the q KG algorithm excels in optimizing synthetic functions and fine tuning practical machine learning algorithms.
