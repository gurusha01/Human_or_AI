This study introduces a method for analyzing the spectrum of complex dynamic systems by leveraging the Koopman operator within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The researchers suggest a procedure for conducting this analysis through a breakdown technique that involves determining orthogonal foundations for the Krylov matrix, within RKHS and decomposing the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator projected onto the space defined by these foundations. The algorithm breaks down the dynamics into a number of patterns that serve as a method for extracting features, in nonlinear dynamical systems. 
The paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the background and purpose of the study by the authors.The technical parts are also well structured. Explained in detail about the new algorithm suggested and its relation to previously used methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The real world examples and practical uses shared in the paper show how effective the new approach is, in estimating Koopman modes and forecasting states of nonlinear dynamical systems.
