This paper introduces a method for training a supervised document distance metric known as the Supervised Word Movers Distance (S WMD). The S WMD enhances the existing Word Movers Distance (or WMD) integrating supervision into the distance calculation process.The WMD is a metric used for measuring the proximity, between two documents by utilizing word embeddings and determining the transportation cost of relocating all words from one document to another within the word embedding space. 
The writers suggest that the WMDs effectiveness is constrained due its lack of supervision that doesn't consider the task or document labels involved in the process. In order overcome this restriction the S WMD adopts a transformation of word representations and a vector for word importance which adjusts the frequencies of words. The S WMD undergoes training with the aim of reducing errors, in stochastic leave one out nearest neighbor classification at an individual document level. 
The article explains in depth the development of the S WMD method with a focus on the loss function calculation and optimization process outlined by the authors.They also introduce a streamlined approach, for estimating gradients by adapting a simplified version of the optimal transport problem reducing computational complexity significantly from O(q^​ ​ 33log(q))​ ​ ​  ​ ​​to O(q^​ ​ 22).
The outcomes of the experiments illustrate how well the S WMD performs across eight real life text classification tasks compared with 26 benchmarks like unsupervised WMD and various methods for representing documents using supervised metric learning algorithms The findings indicate that the S WMD delivers top notch results on datasets and shows notable enhancements, over unsupervised WMD. 
The article is nicely. The authors have given a lucid and succinct description of the suggested method along with the mathematical calculations and details of the algorithm provided in a clear manner.The results of the experiments are extensive and well explained with a comparison, to different baseline scenarios.
