The paper suggests two approaches for optimizing the linear loss minimization challenge of training Supervised PageRank models; a method not relying on gradients and one based on gradients. The authors offer assurances regarding the speed of convergence and the complexity boundaries for both techniques. The gradient free approach uses an optimization framework, without gradients and an approximate oracle; meanwhile the gradient based technique relies on an adaptive projected gradient algorithm with an approximate first order oracle. 
The article is nicely. Offers a comprehensive summary of the issue at hand as well as the suggested approaches and the theoretical examination presented within its pages.The writers also share their findings by contrasting their strategies with the leading gradient based method available today.They demonstrate that their approaches surpass the method in terms of the loss function. 
The paper has strong points, such, as; 
Two novel optimization techniques have been suggested for solving the linear loss minimization issue associated with training Supervised PageRank models. 
 Ensuring there are theoretical assurances regarding how quickly they converge and the level of complexity involved in both approaches. 
The results from the experiments indicate that the new techniques perform better, than the leading method. 
The papers limitations are as follows; 
The paper suggests that the loss function is likely to be convex, near the solution but acknowledges that this assumption may not hold true in all cases. 
The paper doesn't include a comparison to optimization techniques, like stochastic gradient descent or quasi newton methods. 
The findings from the experiment are only applicable to the dataset used and may not be applicable to other datasets, in general. 
The paper is nicely. Offers a valuable addition to the optimization and machine learning domain.The suggested approaches show promise in enhancing the effectiveness of search engines and various other applications dependent, on Supervised PageRank models.
