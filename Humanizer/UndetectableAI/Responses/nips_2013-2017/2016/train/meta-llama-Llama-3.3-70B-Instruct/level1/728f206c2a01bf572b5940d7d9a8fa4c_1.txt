This research introduces a method for teaching Boltzmann machines by utilizing the Wasserstein distance that considers the measurement between observations.The writers calculate a gradient of the Wasserstein distance concerning the model parameters. Display its real world promise in tasks, like data restoration and noise reduction.The manuscript is nicely crafted with explained concepts. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
A fresh idea has emerged for machines with a different objective function that considers the distance, between observations instead of the usual Kullback Leibler divergence. 
Deriving the slope of the Wasserstein distance in relation to the model parameters is an element, in making this approach feasible. 
We showcased how the method works in real world scenarios using datasets, like MNIST and UCI PLANTS to demonstrate its potential. 
The papers shortcomings are as follows; 
The use of the Sinkhorn algorithm, for calculating the Wasserstein distance may not be as effective when dealing with datasets. 
Careful adjustment of hyperparameters is essential; this includes tuning the smoothing parameter γ as well, as the regularization coefficients λ and θ. 
Understanding the connection between the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback Leibler divergence can be challenging when deciding which objective to choose in scenarios due to the ambiguity, in their relationship. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The research suggests an captivating method for educating Boltzman machines considering the distance between data points, in its training process. 
The method has proven effective on datasets such, as MNIST and UCI PLANTS. 
The paper is nicely crafted with presentation of ideas. 
Reasons, in favor of acceptance; 
The method depends on the Sinkhorn algorithm. It might not work well for big datasets. 
Using hyperparameters requires adjustments, which can pose challenges when applying this approach, in real world scenarios. 
Having a grasp of how the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback Leibler divergence are related could pose challenges when deciding between the two objectives, in real life scenarios. 
In my opinion the research paper makes an addition to the domain of machine learning and should be approved for publication. The method outlined in the paper shows promise in enhancing the effectiveness of Boltzmann machines across tasks; furthermore the practical application of this method, on real datasets is quite compelling.
