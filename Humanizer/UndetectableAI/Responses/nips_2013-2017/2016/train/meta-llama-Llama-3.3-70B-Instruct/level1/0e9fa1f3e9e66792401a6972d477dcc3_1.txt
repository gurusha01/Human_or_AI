This research paper introduces an approach called Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD) which aims to assess the precision of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithms for posterior inference.It expands upon the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BDMC method to set limits on the KL divergence, between the actual posterior distribution and the distribution of estimated samples.The authors showcase BREADs effectiveness by incorporating it into two programming languages. WebPPL and Stan. And testing it across various models and datasets. 
The paper is nicely crafted with an succinct introduction, to the background and purpose of the research work presented by the authors.It highlights technical contributions and offers a comprehensive evaluation of the methods strengths and weaknesses.The experiments are thoughtfully planned out. Effectively showcase how BREAD can assess the accuracy of posterior inference algorithms. 
The study discusses research conducted in NIPS and other places that focuses on probabilistic inference and MCMC techniques The writers reference pertinent studies and offer a coherent explanation of how their work expands on and advances current research efforts.
