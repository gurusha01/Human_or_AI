This research paper makes an addition to the area of matrix completionâ€”a crucial issue in machine learning that finds wide use in collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.The authors delve into linear optimization techniques, for matrix completion and offer a detailed examination of the geometric characteristics of the objective function. 
The paper aims to demonstrate that the non linear objective function often utilized for positive semidefinite matrix completion does not have any local minima; all local minima are also global minima according to the analysis of optimalitys first and second order necessary conditions which proves that any point meeting these conditions is indeed a valid solution. 
The article is excellently written with an concise introduction to the issue at hand and their key findings as well as a summary of previous research in the field The technical portions are also structured in an orderly manner, with rigorous and comprehensible proofs provided The authors employ a straightforward proof methodology that can be applied to various statistical dilemmas that entail incomplete or distorted data observations. 
The papers notable attributes comprise of; 
The writers offer an examination of the geometric characteristics of the matrix completion goal function that illuminates the actions of non linear optimization processes in a new way. 
The findings hold importance as they offer assurance for numerous fundamental optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent that see widespread application, in real world scenarios. 
The article is nicely written with an introduction by the authors that covers the issue at hand and their key findings, from related research. 
The paper has some drawbacks, such, as; 
The examination only focuses on the scenario where thingsre equal; it's not certain if the findings can be applied to situations where things are not balanced. 
The writers believe that the recorded data is collected randomly across the board; however this may not align with real world scenarios. 
The research lacks test results to support the theoretical discoveries. 
Reasons, for approval; 
The research paper makes a valuable addition to the realm of matrix completion and its findings hold significance, for shaping optimization algorithms. 
The study is thorough and well crafted with an concise overview of the issue at hand as well, as the relevant research and key findings provided by the authors.
