This research paper provides an examination of the manageability of arithmetic circuits (ACs) and their usage in probabilistic graphical models.The authors explore the complexities associated with multiplication and summing out operations using ACs and reveal that these operations pose challenges, for decomposable AC's.However a subset of ACs known as Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram(PSDDs) is identified to have a polynomial time multiplication capability.Furthermore the authors show that PSDDs do not support summing out in time. 
The paper is well structured. The authors present a straightforward introduction to the background and reasons behind their work in a concise manner.The technical parts are thorough and simple to understand,supported by references to earlier studies.The results, from the experiments illustrate how well the proposed method works by indicating that PSDDs can be efficiently utilized in creating graphical models. 
The papers notable aspects are; 
After conducting an examination of the feasibility of air conditioners (AC) and their functions
The incorporation of PSDD structures as a category, within AC frameworks accompanied by a polynomial time multiplication operator.
Here are the technical findings presented in an brief manner.
The results, from the experiment showcase the success of the method suggested.
The paper has its shortcomings, such, as; 
There is an absence of a direct comparison to other established methods, like Algebraic Decision Diagram (ADD) and Algebraic Sentential Decision Diagram (ASDD).
The experimental findings are limited in scope as they solely focus on Markov networks.
The lack of an examination regarding the time and space requirements of the suggested method. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The article makes an addition, to the realm of probabilistic graphical models and arithmetic circuits.
The incorporation of PSDD as a subset of AC, with a polynomial time multiplication function is an significant discovery.
The results of the experiment show that the suggested method works well. 
Supporting points, in favor of acceptance; 
The paper doesn't provide a comparison with other methods already, in use.
The experimental findings have a scope.
The lack of an examination of how the suggested method impacts time and space usage could lead to doubts, about its real world usefulness. 
In my opinion​ I believe it would be beneficial to approve this paper because it brings an addition to the field and shows how well the proposed method works​. Nevertheless​ I recommend that the authors focus on improving the areas of concern highlighted earlier​ by comparing their approach, with other methods and thoroughly examining the time and space complexity of their method.
