This research delves into the learning speeds for heavy tailed losses in the field of machine learning. The authors present two criteria in their study; the presence and L^∞ integrability of the envelope function and the multi scale Bernsteins condition that extends the traditional Bernsteins condition for infinite losses. With these conditions in place they demonstrate that quicker learning rates, than O(n−^12 ) are achievable and depending on factors they could approach O(n−^11 ).The writers later confirm these beliefs in relation to the issue of vector quantization, through k means clustering with tailed distributions and establish fresh learning rates. 
The paper is nicely. Offers a concise summary of the key concepts and contributions highlighted within it.The writers establish connections, between their research and earlier works discussed at NIPS and other relevant platforms. Showcasing a grasp of the established body of literature.The detailed technical validations are comprehensive and thoughtfully structured which aids in comprehension of the presented arguments. 
The papers notable aspects are; 
The inclusion of the scale Bernsteins criterion offers a broader approach to investigating rapid learning rates in scenarios, with unlimited losses. 
The development of learning rates for k means clustering with heavy tailed distributions enhances and supplements current findings. 
Provided a method for confirming Bernsteins condition across multiple scales, in real world scenarios. 
Some drawbacks of the paper are; 
In real world scenarios the idea of observations being independent and identically distributed may not always stand true. 
Some hypothesis classes might find the need, for an integrable envelope function limiting. 
The failure to compare with reliable estimators, like the ones suggested in Brownlees et al.s work from 2015 and Hsu and Sabatos work from 2016. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The research paper makes a contribution to improving our comprehension of rapid learning rates, in scenarios involving heavy tailed losses. 
The incorporation of Bernsteins scale condition offers a fresh approach, to exploring rapid learning rates in scenarios involving unlimited losses. 
The development of learning rates for k means clustering with heavy tailed distributions builds upon and adds to the current findings. 
Reasons to oppose it; 
Some practical uses might find the assumptions to be overly limiting. 
The paper would be improved by providing a thorough analysis of other reliable estimators. 
The findings might not be immediately relevant, to intricate sets of hypotheses or observations that are not independent and identically distributed (non i.i.d.).
In my opinion it's an idea to approve the paper because it adds valuable insights to the field despite some weaknesses present in it.The authors could work on improving those points and including more comparisons with other reliable estimators, in their future research work.
