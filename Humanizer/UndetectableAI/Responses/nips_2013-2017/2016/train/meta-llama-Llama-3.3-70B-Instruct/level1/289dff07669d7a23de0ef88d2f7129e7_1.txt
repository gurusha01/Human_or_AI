The report suggests a change to the CMA Evolution Strategy (ES) an used optimization method that does not rely on derivatives. The researchers propose the Cholesky CMA Evolution Strategy (ES) which substitutes the method of updating the matrix square root with a Cholesky factorization in a triangular form. This adjustment reduces the time complexity from O(d cubed​​​ ) to O(mu times d squared) where mu is typically proportional, to log(d). The alteration is backed by theory. Confirmed through empirical evidence that it does not hinder the algorithms efficiency. 
The article is nicely written with an concise introduction to the CMAES algorithm and its shortcomings provided by the authors.The suggested adjustment is explained in detail. Backed by solid theoretical reasoning.The real world testing is comprehensive as it compares the Cholesky CMAES, against CMAES versions across different benchmark functions. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
The suggested change is innovative. Tackles a notable drawback of the conventional CMA‐ES approach. 
The theoretical reasoning is thorough and clearly articulated. 
The thorough assessment provides a showcase of how well the Cholesky CMA–ES performs in practice. 
The paper has some drawbacks, such, as; 
The article expects readers to have an understanding of optimization and linear algebra concepts which might pose a challenge for those who are not experts, in the field. 
Some readers who are not well versed in optimization may find some of the symbols and vocabulary unfamiliar. 
The article would be improved by delving into the possible restrictions and downsides of the suggested alteration. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The article suggests an important change, to a commonly used optimization algorithm.
