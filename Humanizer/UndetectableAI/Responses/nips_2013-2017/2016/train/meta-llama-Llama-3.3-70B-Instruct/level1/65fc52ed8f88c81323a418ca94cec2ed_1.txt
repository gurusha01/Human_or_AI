This research introduces a way to learn visual similarities among a large set of examples without supervision using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors highlight the drawbacks of approaches that either depend on significant labeled data or struggle with an imbalance between positive and negative samples. Their method CliqueCNN tackles these challenges through an optimization process that picks batches of concise and distinct groups of samples without labels to facilitate learning similarities as a categorization task, in separate batches. 
The paper is nicely. The authors give a clear and concise summary of their proposed methods approach in a detailed manner.The thorough experimental evaluation includes results from three datasets (namely Olympic Sports Leeds Sports and PASCAL VOC 2007) illustrating the effectiveness of their method.The authors also offer an, in depth examination of the outcomes by pointing out the pros and cons of their approach.
