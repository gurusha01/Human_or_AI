This document delves into saddle point problems that show a convex concave nature and explains how current stochastic variance reduction methods like SVRG and SAGA can be used in conjunction with an operator, for solving these problems effectively. The authors analyze these issues using operators and demonstrate linear convergence in their study. Additionally， they introduce a version and investigate a sampling method that is not uniform.  
The paper brings innovative ideas to the table through in depth theoretical examination that offers new insights into saddle point problems of high significance.The authors make a noteworthy extension of their approach to encompass separable functions—a notable addition, to the field.  
From a perspective although the theoretical advancements are praiseworthy there is room for improvement in the way the information is presented. Clarifying the link to monotone operators, which is currently discussed as an extension, in Section 6 would enhance the papers readability. Given that the analysis depends on monotone operators introducing this concept earlier could aid the readers understanding.  
Expanding the scope of the study by incorporating datasets beyond just two would enhance the research papers credibility significantly. It would be advantageous to compare the findings with techniques like the stochastic version of the Chambolle Pock algorithm (referenced in http;//www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/zhang15.pdf). Make sure to include this citation, in your submission. 
There are an areas that the authors need to clarify. 
Assumptions A Cs validity needs explanation—especially assumption A—and it would be beneficial if we could ascertain whether these assumptions remain applicable when addressing the saddle point issue arising from SVM. 
A detailed explanation of the variances, between the stochastic primal dual approach and the method proposed by the authors is needed. 
In Theorem 2 provided has raised a question, about the clarity of the constant \mu referenced within it; specifically if it relates to the monotonicity constant discussed in the appendix and how this finding differs from Theorem 1s conclusion. 
The shift from assumptions (1) (3) as outlined in the appendix can be puzzling at glance raising questions like whether these assumptions necessitate a sense of monotonicity, in the context being discussed. 
There are some problems to consider; 
There is a confusion with the L being used for both the condition number and the Lipschitz constant in mathematical contexts like "The quantity L represents the condition number of the problem " and "we need the Lipschitz constant L." It can be unclear, without clarification. 
To improve the thoroughness of the paper it would be beneficial to include a citation, for the Forward–Backward algorithm.
