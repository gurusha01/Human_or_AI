This paper delves into the topic of setting reserve prices for buyers who engage in a number of rounds (represented by tau) and decide on a purchase based on whether the minimum price they come across falls below their reserve price threshold.They shift my perspective after the authors response to this issue. Now I see that the main focus of the authors is on establishing a lower boundary rather, than an upper one.The abstract of the paper needs reworking to accurately represent its contents. Moreover the authors should stress the link, between their study and issues of policy regret giving importance to this aspect when presenting their research.
