This paper explores the factors that help synchronize points in a standardized issue with a fourth dimensional element, with the best outcomes of resolving matrix issues smoothly and efficiently in my view. This is the best piece I've had the chance to review this year because it provides a clear and well planned presentation of an important discovery while fitting it seamlessly into the context of recent related studies." These findings have caught my interest as they could possibly apply to groups with spread components like the ones mentioned in a study found at http;//arxiv.org./abs1408 2467'. The paper seems similar to a recent research piece that can be accessed at http;//arxiv.org./abs1605 08101'. Despite the submission deadlines overlapping each others timeframe it shouldn't cause any problems to acknowledge and reference this work, for added value. My feedback is mostly minor. Involves some suggestions for improvement. Capitalize the "f' in " Frobenius " consider rephrasing "our attention'' in line 229 for better clarity and remove the unnecessary plural suffix from the phrase "nice properties that ensure'', in line 251.
