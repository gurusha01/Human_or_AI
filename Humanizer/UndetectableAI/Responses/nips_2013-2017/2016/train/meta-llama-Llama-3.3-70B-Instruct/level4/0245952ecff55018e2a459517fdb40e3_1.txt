This paper introduces a network technique based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy framework. The method is tested on limited benchmark tasks to assess both its ability to differentiate and create new data. In general this study makes an addition to the realm of deep learning research that focuses on building models that can generate new data. The clarity of the paper is adequate though the mathematical aspects may be difficult to grasp in some instances, which's a common challenge, in this field. The tasks tested in the experiments are similar to those in studies in this field but with some limitations in their scope.The model training process requires a lot of resources so it would be helpful to discuss the time taken for training compared to other methods like DSN in the experimental section including reference codes, for the experiments can make the manuscript more robust as not having these details may make it difficult for practitioners to replicate the models accurately based only on the information provided in the model section.
