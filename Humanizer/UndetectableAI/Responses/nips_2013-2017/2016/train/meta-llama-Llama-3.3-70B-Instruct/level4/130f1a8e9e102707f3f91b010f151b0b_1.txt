This paper introduces a method for pinpointing key brain areas using a wide reaching online dictionary learning systemâ€”a subject that garners significant attention from researchers and scholars alike. Howeverlack of theoretical scrutiny to validate the algorithms effectiveness stands out as a noticeable oversight in the manuscript. Moreoverthe written content seems to lack depth and precisionhinting at an oversight, on the part of the authors in carefully reviewing their work before final submission. The papers quality is compromised by the lack of editing when encountering unresolved comments like "146 XXX. I don't get the transition, from V to v."
