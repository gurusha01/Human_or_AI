This paper suggests an improvement to Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, by adding a "time gate," which is controlled based on time and learned parameters independently for each LSTM cells time gate mechanism that keeps the cell unchanged when closed—an innovative approach worth noting.  
In terms of technology perspectivé¸ two important factors should be taken into account;  
The way the time gate is currently formulated may not be the approach, in this context.It might be better to consider defining the time gate as a function that changes continuously over time. For example No need to make it too complicated.Just keep it simple and straightforward.#HumanTouch
Analyzing the models performance on a speech recognition test could offer insights, into its abilities. 
The paper stands out for exploring asynchronous event processing in a way that is worth recognizing as a valuable addition to the field of study. The findings have the potential to spark research and suggestions for enhancement due to their meaningful influence. The outcomes reveal enhancements, in the tasks that were tackled.  
However we need to make it clear if the claimed twenty fold decrease in runtime computing expensess merely a concept or if its backed by real world hardware tests since this differentiation greatly impacts the feasibility of implementing the suggested improvement, in practice.
