The writers of this paper suggest a method, for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) that differs from traditional Monte Carlo methods by using Bayesian density estimation to directly approximate the posterior distribution analytically instead of computationally simulating it like with ABC and variational inference in previous studies [1]. The paper is well organized and easy to understand for experts without being overly complicated. Expanding upon studies findings and insights is a central theme explored in Proposition 1 in a well crafted manner in the paper. Particularly evident in the careful selection of the initial proposal and the subsequent estimation of the posterior approximation. Moreover there are fresh ideas presented such as the extension of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) into Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). However further enrichment of the discussion could be achieved by incorporating pertinent research related to utilizing SVI along, with ABC methods as mentioned in reference [1]. The paper may not have a theoretical groundwork beyond the asymptotic rationale outlined in Proposition 1; however this is considered satisfactory given the limitations of the NIPS format.The experimental outcomes provide a rounded blend of simple instances and intricate datasets that are explained coherently.The authors adeptly differentiate between the impacts of choosing proposal distributions and estimating posteriors.Although the graphs take into account sample size it may be more suitable to use a different measure such as actual CPU time since, in this context samples are computational entities.
