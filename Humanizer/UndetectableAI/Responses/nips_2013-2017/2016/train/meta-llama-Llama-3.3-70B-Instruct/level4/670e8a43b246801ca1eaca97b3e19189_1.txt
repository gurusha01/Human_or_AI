This document suggests an initial assumption for Bayesian non parametric clustering that works better in scenarios where the size of clusters doesn't grow in line with the amount of data points present. A departure from the underlying "rich gets richer" assumption seen in Dirichlet Process (DP) and similar priors.The authors have specifically outlined how cluster sizes are distributed within this process and have introduced two variations that employ various distribution forms, over cluster sizes. In the appendix section of the paper they also offer a Gibbs sampling algorithm and a split and merge algorithm for comparison with DP and the Pitman Yor Process (known as PYP). They delve into datasets to tackle a crucial problem in Bayesian non parametric (BNF) introducing an interesting prior, along the way.However setbacks have been identified well;  
The authors recognize the study mentioned in reference [13] which addresses an issue by proposing a uniform prior instead of the "rich gets richer" prior found in DP and PYP models leading to more clusters being formed. However the paper falls short in providing a comparison, with reference [13] and does not explore the specifics of how their research connects with or differs from reference [13] regarding the characteristics of the resulting aside from briefly mentioning it. 
The consequences of giving up consistency to attain the clustering feature are not fully explored and neither is a comparison drawn with relinquishing exchangeability as illustrated in [13] which could offer valuable perspective into the compromises at play. 
The test outcomes are not definitive since its uncertain if any enhancements hold importance.The efficiency of the updated procedures doesn't completely overshadow that of ones in all aspects; this leads to doubts, about their efficacy. 
The text can be a bit tricky to grasp for readers in the subject area because of the heavy reliance, on symbols; making it clearer and simpler would improve how easily readers can understand and engage with the content.
