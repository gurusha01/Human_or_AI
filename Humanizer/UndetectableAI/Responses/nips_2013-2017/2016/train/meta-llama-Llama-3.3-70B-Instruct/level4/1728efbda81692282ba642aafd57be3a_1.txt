This document describes a method for analyzing spectra using the Koopman operator within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then using a common framework to create kernel based methods for studying nonlinear dynamic systems based on real world data findings.The eigenvalues of the Koopman operators projection enhance efficiency when analyzing both actual data tasks.The study introduces a kernel design for examining nonlinear dynamic systems, with justified inputs and experimental confirmation.However the authors should address some issues raised.  
The difference between this study and previous research conducted by M.O Williams et al. which utilized Koopman eigenvalues and modes, for analyzing nonlinear system dynamics 2015 is not clearly defined here A thorough comparison and discussion outlining the key distinctions would be helpful. 
The area of studying systems with nonlinear dynamics and kernel methods is vast and rich in resources; however there are some notable references that are not mentioned in the text such as works, by L.Ralaivola andF.d’Alche Buc,Tuia et al,Rojo Alavarez et al,M.Mouattamid and R.Shcack or M.O.Franz and B.B.Shcolkopf.The writers ought to think about including these references to offer a thorough perspective. 
The Koopman operator is typically described for systems that're deterministic in nature; however delving deeper into its effectiveness in stochastic environments. Which are more representative of reality. Would be valuable feedback to consider further, from the authors standpoint. It was noted briefly by the authors but additional elaboration and perhaps a simple experiment could help showcase the operators potential better. 
The comment found on page 5 in line 216 indicates that the estimation method may not always involve a sequence but rather a set of pairs of observations with nonlinear pointwise connections between them The effects of this assumption on multidimensional time series with possibly limited pointwise relationships and the advantages of the suggested kernel design, in such scenarios need to be elaborated further Also the authors should delve into the causal presumption embedded in the context and its consequences
The experimental setup seems a bit constrained since it mostly adheres to methods.The section on "Embedding and Recognition of Dynamics" doesn’t delve into discussing the connections and contrasts with studies on clustering time series like kernel k means and other similar subspace kernel methods.Furthermore the experiment on change point detection could benefit from comparing the suggested approach, with cutting edge online change detection techniques using kernels because the current method is acknowledged to struggle with intricate dynamics. Additional experiments are needed to strengthen the argument for progress, in this area. 
 There are a minor matters to address in the paper. It is well written and understandable overall; however a couple of typos were spotted that need attention; Firstly the indices on tau− ₁ versus tau should be reviewed. Secondly a comma ought to be used of a dot in k(xi,x j) which is in the final equation, on page seven.
