This paper introduces a method for measuring the difference between an MCMC sampler and its target distribution using bidirectional Monte Carlo techniques in the context of troubleshooting and assessing MCMC implementations in languages for probabilistic programming systems.The idea of utilizing BDMC to pinpoint problems in samplers is interesting and potentially valuable due to the shortcomings of MCMC diagnostic tools.Research studies, like [1] and [2] have also explored the effectiveness of MCMC samplers by testing them on data generated from the distribution. In Section 3.A. the explanation is unclear and hard to follow because q(.) is introduced early without a clear definition as the distribution of the AIS sampler, after T steps. Though the supplement offers some clarification the main text should stand alone without needing materials for understanding. Here's a human like version of the AI generated text; It would be helpful to provide a detailed guide for implementing the method since readers currently have to piece together the process from different sections of the document. Some suggestions for improvement include simplifying the notation by combining variables z and theta since they are consistently used together and fixing the missing closing parentheses, in Line 165. I also recommend checking out this reference; Geweke (2004) discusses joint distribution tests of simulators in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. The papers referenced in http;//doi.org./10119816214504000001132. [1] Authored by Cook et al. discuss the validation of software for Bayesian models through the use of posterior quantiles, in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (2012). The significance of these studies is highlighted in this discussion.
