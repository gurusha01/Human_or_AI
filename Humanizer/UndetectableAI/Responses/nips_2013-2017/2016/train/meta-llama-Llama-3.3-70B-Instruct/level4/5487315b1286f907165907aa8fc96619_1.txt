This study introduces a model for a two layer neural network with restrictions on the middle layer structure to optimize training objectives efficiently in real world scenarios.The authors extensively explain the methodology used and test it on applications such as transliteration and image inpainting tasks.However I am skeptical about the validity of this approach due to the assumptions and simplifications made in the research which raise doubts, about its practical effectiveness. For example the use of a " level" target rather than the typical likelihood goal lacks a clear explanation in terms of optimization context and is justified mainly by simplification reasons requiring more discussion, on how it affects the models being learned.Similarly the SDP relaxation method though it makes the problem convex is not fully described making it unclear how it balances convexity and fidelity loss. The papers clarity is affected by issues such as the unproven assertion that optimizing over S and Y is equivalent unless Y is constrained (for example { 0  1 }  d ) along with several typos and grammatical errors mentioned within it.The experiments are interesting and show outcomes when compared with CRF AE; however a more comprehensive analysis would be beneficial.It should include comparisons of likelihood values well as computational efficiency and performance concerning nonstructured methods in orderfor a clearer understanding of the significance of structure, in these problems. In the end，even though the approach could be helpful，it is essential to provide an explanation，examination，and practical testing to ensure its credibility．After considering the authors’ input，I now recognize the mistake in my original review concerning line 132 and have revised my assessment of its technical excellence accordingly．
