This article introduces a method for handling data labeling from crowdsourcing platforms by treating each worker as a source of information through different types of channels. The symmetric memoryless channel and the spammer or hammer channel model without feedback mechanisms taken into consideration. By viewing this problem as an encoding challenge for each kind of channel used in the process the authors delve into evaluating how budget allocation impacts the code rate and explore the balance, between accuracy and budget constraints. Moreover they delve into a coding method known as k incidence coding that entails collaborative tasks centered on categorizing groups of k items at the same time.I found the article to be interesting although it falls outside my area of expertise so I am unable to offer insights.
