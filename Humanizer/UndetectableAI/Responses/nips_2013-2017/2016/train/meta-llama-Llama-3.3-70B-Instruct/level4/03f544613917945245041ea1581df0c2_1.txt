This paper delves into how Richardson Romberg extrapolation (RRE) can be applied in big data MCMC" methods focusing on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGDL). RRE has been a tool in numerical integration and its recent success in numerical stochastic differential equations (SDTEs) is noteworthy for its ability to connect the realms of MCMC and SDE studies which could be advantageous, for both areas. The writers introduce a SGLZ RRE approach and discuss the theoretical progress of this method (even in cases where SGLZ RRE surpasses standard SGLZ) along with practical trials conducted.The findings reveal enhancements in simple illustrations and steady progress in extensive settings.Altogether the article is logically. Easily understood.It presents a merger of two different domains, with compelling theoretical perspectives and convincing real world results from the suggested method. The method used here is a way of applying RRE to SGLD that is efficient in terms of computation power. Although it won't bring about changes in the current methods being used by practitioners in the field. One minor suggestion for enhancement involves making it clearer that Fig 1a shows a distribution with empirical posterior mean and variance instead of the empirical estimated posterior distribution itself, for better understanding and avoiding confusion. Furthermore it could be helpful to include an explanation in Figure 2A discussing why the bias may not decrease proportionally with a decrease, in step size; some readers might find this counterintuitive.
