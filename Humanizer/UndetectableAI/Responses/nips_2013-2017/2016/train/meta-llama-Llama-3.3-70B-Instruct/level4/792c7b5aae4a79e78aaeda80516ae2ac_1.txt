This research explores how a population EM algorithm behaves when dealing with examples of mixtures of Gaussian distributions and pays close attention to the initial starting points used in the process.The authors show that a sample based EM algorithm displays long term characteristics as the population EM algorithm when starting from the same initial conditions.The study focuses on evaluating the performance of the EM algorithm in two models involving mixtures of two Gaussian distributions and offers a detailed examination of how it operates in this scenario. The results are quite interesting as they cover all the scenarios and provide a comprehensive insight into how well the EM algorithm performs in this particular situation. One point of critique is that the proofs seem to be overly long for a paper that focuses only one model. However; since even basic combinations of two components are not completely understood yet; this study adds valuable knowledge to the field and I am leaning towards endorsing its acceptance, at NIPS.
