This study delves into how Richardson Romberg extrapolation (RRE) can be used in big data MCMC" methods focusing on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGDL). RRE is a trusted numerical integration technique that has shown success in handling stochastic differential equations (SDSE). One significant aspect of this research is its attempt to connect the worlds of MCMC and SDE studies which can offer insights for researchers, in these fields. The researchers introduce an approach called SGLS RRE method and provide theoretical insights on how this algorithm converges (even in cases where it surpasses regular SGLS). They also conduct tests that show notable enhancements in simple scenarios and steady yet small advantages, in complex environments.The paper is crafted and easy to follow.  
This paper makes links between two different areas and presents a practical algorithm that is well explained and technically solid in a simple and efficient way for SGLD by adapting RRE method effectively but not revolutionary, in current practices.  
In Figure 1As illustration is a bit confusing. It doesn't show the estimated posterior distribution but rather a Gaussian based on the empirical posterior mean and variance data points.This difference should be explained better for readers who're not as familiar with the subject matter.Additionally, in Figure 2A,an explanation of why bias may not decrease with smaller step sizes would be useful as this behavior may appear counterintuitive.
