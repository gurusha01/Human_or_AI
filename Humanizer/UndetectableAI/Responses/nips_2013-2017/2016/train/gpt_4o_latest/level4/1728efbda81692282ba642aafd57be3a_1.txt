This document introduces a framework for analyzing spectra by using the Koopman operator within a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space layout.The authors then apply an approach to present a variety of kernel based methods for examining nonlinear dynamic systems based on actual data.The decomposition of the projected Koopman operator shows efficiency in analyzing both artificial and real data scenarios.This study offers a kernel model for investigating nonlinear dynamic systems, with well supported contributions backed by experimental verification. However  I have some concerns that I think the authors need to discuss; 
The difference between this research and the previous study by M.O Williams et al., published as citation [35] seems ambiguous to me as a reader with their work on approximating the Koopman operator using dynamic mode decomposition techniques for nonlinear system analysis back to 2015. I kindly request a comparison outlining the main disparities between the two research works alongside an additional elaboration, within Section 4 to address this topic further. 
The study of dynamical systems with kernels is vast but lacks some important references that the authors should think about including to give a broader framework for their findings such as works, by L.Ralaivola and Buc Tuia et al., Rojo Alvarez et al., Mouattamid and Schaback and Franz and Schölkop.
The Koopman operator is usually described for systems; however it would be beneficial to also address its behavior in stochastic environments as they are more applicable to real world scenarios.Notably the authors mention this briefly. A more thorough exploration along, with a practical experiment would enhance the papers credibility. 
The point made on line 216 of page 5 regarding the estimation process not needing a sequence but rather a set of pairs of observations that are nonlinearly pointwise related needs to be explained further for better understanding. I am especially curious about how this assumption impacts multidimensional time series with weak pointwise connections. What benefits does the suggested kernel construction offer in scenarios? Moreover I would like to have a conversation, about the assumptions embedded in the proposed framework as well. 
In my opinion the experimental setup seems a bit narrow in scope to me. I think the way they predict via pre imaging is quite standard in approach The section on "Embedding and Recognition of Dynamics" doesn't really delve deep into discussing how the proposed method connects with the vast amount of existing literature, on time series clustering like kernel k means and other similar subspace kernel methods. Moreover to enhance the change point detection experiment it would be helpful to compare with advanced online change detection techniques that utilize kernels. The method used by the authors is acknowledged to have difficulties, with dynamics. Further comprehensive and compelling experiments are required to validate the suggested methodology. 
 The paper is nicely. Easy to understand in general. I spotted a couple of typos. Could you double check the indices for τ. ́ ́ Versus τ and change the dot to a comma in k(xi,x_i)(last equation, on page seven).
