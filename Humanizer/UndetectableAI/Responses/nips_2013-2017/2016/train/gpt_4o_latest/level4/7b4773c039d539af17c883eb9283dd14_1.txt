This paper introduces a new planning algorithm called TrailBlazer that uses Monte Carlo methods.The algorithm works under the assumption that it has access to the model of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). Its goal is to calculate the value function of the initial node \( V(s_o)\) while reducing the need for accessing the generative model as much as possible.This approach takes into account a scenario, with discounted rewards. Can be applied to state spaces that are either finite or infinite. The document presents a few assurances. PAC consistency and upper limits on generative model calls for both finite and infinite state spaces, with high probability. In situations or scenarios; the outcomes may either enhance previous worst case estimates (such as in situations with finite state spaces and stochastic changes) align with current findings (like deterministic changes or situations without control comparable to traditional Monte Carlo methods) or present new discoveries (for instance, in scenarios involving infinite state spaces). 
The TrailBlazer algorithm switches back and forth between two kinds of nodes named Avg and Max nodes in its process flow. Avg nodes work by approximating the value of their children through sampling based on transition probabilities. Essentially working as a Monte Carlo estimator with the parameter \( m \) controlling the variance of this estimation. On the contrary,<Organization> Max nodes focus on pinpointing the child node that holds the value by progressively eliminating less optimal children with strong certainty.  
This paper presents an algorithm with promising real world applications while also showcasing its theoretical consistency and superior performance compared to current methods in specific situations such as finite state spaces with generative models and stochastic systems.It is written overall but could use more explanation to highlight the reasons, behind the algorithms effectiveness over other approaches.This area could be explored further. Furthermore because of the approach used in tree based analysis the proofs tend to be fairly intricate. However this complexity is often deemed necessary. 
Here are my thoughts and queries;   
Why is the guarantee, in Theorem 3 only given on average?   
The algorithm doesn't seem to take advantage of patterns in the value function like smoothness. Is there a way to enhance it by using these characteristics? Maybe something akin, to the StoSO algorithm (outlined by Valko et al. "Stochastic Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization," presented at ICML 2013) could be considered?  
The document mentions that when action gaps are not zeroed out \( d \) the dimension can be adjusted to zero. In practical situations where action gaps vary across states following a certain distribution pattern as explained in Farahmands work on the "Action Gap Phenomenon, in Reinforcement Learning" at NIPS 2011 conference. What kind of valuable insights can be drawn for such scenarios?   
Section 3. 3 (Distinguishing bias and variance ) is a bit unclear. Particularly the phrase "By doing this their algorithms calculate... However in our strategy..." needs explanation.
