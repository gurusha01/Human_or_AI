This research paper delves into batch by batch Bayesian Optimization with a focus on adapting the Knowledge Gradient (KG). It introduces a batch by batch version of the KG criterion. Explains its computation in comparison to the standard KG criterion methodology after covering related work and Gaussian processes background information.The paper further showcases numerical experiments to illustrate that q KGBatch outperforms some leading batch, by batch Bayesian Optimization algorithms available today. This paper is really well. I think it deserves to be accepted at NIPS due, to its strong merits regarding the societal impact of parallelizing Bayesian optimization algorithms.  
Nevertheless I do have a criticism ; the document does not delve into the improvements made when shifting from running tasks one at a time to optimizing tasks in batches. Moreover there are an inaccuracies in the literature review. For instance the concept of combining Expected Improvement (EI ) with distributions was previously mentioned in " Krigi ng proves effective, for parallelizing optimization " ( which also introduced the Constant Liar method ) while Chevalier and colleagues notably brought up CL mix in their work [ 2 ].In addition to that the paper "Examining the application of maximizing q EIs through the gradient, in the context of optimizing batch design" delves into this topic. 
At last I have some thoughts and queries to share;   
Is set A compact. Is function f continuous?   
Why are we limited to using a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LSH)) design, in the stages of As development?   
How does Algorithm 1 address the adjustment of hyperparameters, through re evaluation or Bayesian updates?   
In Section 5 point two is g referred to as a maximum or a minimum value ?  
In Section 5.A time around brings up the point that the overall flow of g doesn't appear to be clear right away.   
The derivative of the Cholesky factor might not be easy to calculate in the way.   
Isn't the Mat√©rn kernel supposed to be 3.0 of 0.4?   
Was it viable to utilize software tools to configure the identical Gaussian Processes (GP) as demonstrated in Figure 1 and the related experiments?
