The study explores how to create features without supervision to determine similarities using examples and introduces a way of training and a specific loss function [which is a modified version of a loss function for discrete clustering] that combines a CNN structure with clustering methods to tackle the issue of uneven training data, in situations where examples are employed with extensive neural networks.The researchers test their approach using three datasets; Olympic images,Pose estimation and the Pascal object recognition dataset. I found the article to be quite interesting as it introduces a method of using CNNs to teach unsupervised similarity traits from examples in a unique way It suggests an original loss function that is differentiable and uses clustering to divide data into distinct groups that help maintain balance in the data It addresses the common problem of having a small number of examples compared to a large number of negative instances The paper is well crafted and motivated and makes a valuable contribution to the emerging trend of combining discrete optimization approaches with deep networks, for significant outcomes The results from data sets look encouraging so far; however there is still potential, for improvement.  
I'm worried about switching to a feature initialization for the PASCAL dataset from HOG LDA to Wang et al. Does this mean that HOG LDA features don't work well for initialization in this case scenario ? If they don't work well can the suggested approach bounce back, from such a start?  
Minor Problems; It would be clearer to rephrase the expression "becomes corrupted" in line 41. Line 130 should include a reference for complete linkage clustering. Results for the PASCAL dataset are provided for k equals to 5; it would be beneficial to have results for k ranging from 1, to 10. Does the noted 3% enhancement rely on using k equals to 4?  
I have identified some grammar and spelling errors in your text.  
The verb tenses seem to be a bit mixed up, in line 2 of your writing.   
"Getting a patch, for..." may need to be rephrased for grammar accuracy.   
Could you please provide context or information, about the situation so that I can better understand your concern and offer a clearer explanation?
