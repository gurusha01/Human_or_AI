The article presents an approach for Bayesian non parametric (BNP ) clustering designed for situations where the amount of data, within each cluster doesn't increase proportionally with the total data points (in other words they relax the assumption of "rich get richer" found in the Dirichlet Process (DP ) and similar methods). The authors specifically consider how cluster sizes are distributed in their proposed method and offer two versions of the method depending on distributions of cluster sizes. They also present a Gibbs sampling technique and a split and combine method (found in the appendix). They compare these methods with the DP and Pitman Yor Process (also known as PYP) using datasets in their study.The paper tackles an issue in BNP clustering and introduces an interesting prior distribution approach.However there are limitations, in the study;  
In line 64 of the text mentioned by the authors [13] it is highlighted that they addressed an issue by implementing a uniform prior instead of the "rich get richer'' prior present, in the DP and PYP models; this showed that their method resulted in a greater number of clusters compared to the DP method. Unfortunately the writers do not compare their technique with [13]. Do they have a thorough discussion – except for a brief mention in line 64 – on how their method is connected to and varies from [13], in terms of the characteristics of the resulting prior.   
The authors fail to explore the trade offs related to giving up consistency to attain the micro clustering feature or to compare this trade off with the relinquishment of exchangeability as discussed in reference [13].   
The outcomes of the experiment are inconclusive as they do not clearly show whether the reported enhancements are statistically significant. Additionally the new methods do not consistently outperform the existing approaches, across all criteria.   
The text can be challenging to understand for those versed in the subject area due to its complexity and excessive use of symbols that could use some simplification, for better clarity.
