The article discusses the issue of tagging data gathered from crowdsourcing by depicting each worker as a channel with noise in the system. They explore two types of channel models. The symmetric memoryless channel, without feedback and the spammer/troll channel model. This approach changes the tagging process into a coding challenge depending on the selected channel model. The writers investigate how the budget relates to the code rate by connecting budget limitations to the codes rate. The research delves into the balance between distortion and budget. Introduces a simple coding method called k incidence coding that involves assigning tasks to crowdsourced workers to label subsets of k items at the same time.I found the paper quite interesting. Its not, within my main area of expertise so I don't have specific feedback to offer.
