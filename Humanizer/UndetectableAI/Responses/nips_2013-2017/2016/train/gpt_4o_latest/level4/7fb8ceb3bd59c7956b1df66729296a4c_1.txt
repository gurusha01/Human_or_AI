The study examines the circumstances in which the critical points of a regularized issue (involving a quaternary term in the regularization process) coincide with the optimal solutions of the matrix completion problem This paper really stood out to me as one of the most impressive works I've come across this year It provides a clear explanation of an important finding and effectively links it to recent relevant research I'm curious to see if these results could be expanded to an ensemble with entries distributed uniformly (, for example; http;//arxiv.org./abs1408..2467) The paper is closely related to a publication available at http;//arxiv.org./abs160508101; nevertheless the timing of our submission aligning with this work does not seem problematic to me Its inclusion, in the references would be advantageous Besides these points I have a few minor notes. "Frobenius " in line 229 should be capitalized. The phrase "our attention " as mentioned in line 229. The expression "nice properties that ensure " in line 251 should not have an additional "s."
