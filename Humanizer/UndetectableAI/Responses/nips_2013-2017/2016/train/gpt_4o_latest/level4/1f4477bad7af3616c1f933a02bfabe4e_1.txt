The study delves into a category of neural networks and showcases how the network reaches a stable point as highlighted by the authors findings.The author introduces an algorithm that leads to this distinct fixed position representing the overall lowest point of the cost function.The research tackles a challenge by demonstrating that a fairly intricate model can display a single stationary point, within specific limitations. In addition to convexity (or similar concepts like convexity) a popular method for demonstrating the singular nature of stationary points centers on fixed point theory â€“ the technique utilized in this study.The writer establishes a mapping wherein the fixed point functions, as the sole minimizer of the cost function.  
One downside of the suggested technique is that it heavily depends on controlling the radius of a non trivial matrix for proving convergence. A restriction pointed out by the authors that hampers its application to networks with more hidden units. Moreover is the considerable amount of parameters requiring tuning which complicates the methods user friendliness. Furthermore, for every parameter setup verification of the condition is necessary. The researchers conducted tests on around 150000 sets of parameters and chose the best setup by considering cross validation accuracy.It is noteworthy that after such a thorough exploration only 2, out of the total 7 datasets were surpassed by their approach when compared to linear SVMs.This leads to inquiries regarding the efficacy of the neural network model being studied.
