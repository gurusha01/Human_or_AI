In this study paper by the authors suggests a representation of a training goal for two layer networks with constrained middle layers structure.The derivation of their proposal is explained along with its use in two structured situations like transliteration and image inpainting experiments.However I am hesitant about the reliance on assumptions,tweaks and estimations, in this work.It makes it difficult to grasp the functioning of the resulting algorithm. For instance of using the usual likelihood objective they opt for a "bi level" objective without a clear interpretation in optimization contexts. Although this simplifies the optimization process it requires discussion. Does this substitution affect the types of models learned? If it does, in what manner? Likewise the paper utilizes an SDP relaxation but does not offer an in depth explanation of it— how do we balance the advantages of convexity against the decrease, in accuracy? 
There are some clarity issues as well in the text you mentioned earlier at line 132 where it claims that optimizing over S is the same, as optimizing over Y unless there are constraints placed on Y like being a subset of {0​​​ ​​​ ​​​ } ​​​ { ​​. } ​​​ Where d represents the dimensions but this constraint is not explicitly mentioned in the paper. Moreover​ the document has a number of typos and grammatical mistakes that make it harder to read. The study shows promising and favorable outcomes when compared to CRFAE; however the main objective of the paper is to make CRFAE more "convex." To provide a comprehensive understanding beyond just the final performance measurements would be beneficial. It would be interesting to investigate if the proposed CVX method attains a probability than CRFAE. One might anticipate this outcome considering its nature and capability to determine the optimal solution globally. Though it's possible that changes, in objectives and relaxation techniques employed for convexity may affect this outcome. If it doesn't show a chance of success​ in what way can we make sense of the encouraging results from the experiments​ ? Does the new approach lead to execution times​ ? Also​ it would be beneficial to compare it with methods to understand how crucial structure is, in these tasks​. ​ 
In general，though the approach shows promise，I have lingering questions．I believe that the document needs a more comprehensive exposition and examination to be persuasive，as well as more thorough experimental assessments．  
  After receiving feedback and reviewing the response, from the authors regarding line 132 in my statement which was incorrect; I acknowledge the validity of the claim stated in the paper and have revised my technical quality rating to 3 accordingly as a reflection of this oversight.
