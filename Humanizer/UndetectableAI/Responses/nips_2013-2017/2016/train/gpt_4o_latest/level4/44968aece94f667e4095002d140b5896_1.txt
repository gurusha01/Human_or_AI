The document discusses the difficulty of setting reserve prices for buyers who engage in only τ rounds and decide on purchases depending on if the lowest price during their participation goes under their reserve price limit threshold. Upon reviewing the authors counterarguments my viewpoint on this issue has changed; I now understand that the key contributions of the paper are found not in the limit but, in the minimum threshold set by the authors. The summary needs polishing and improvement. Furthermore​; it's important for the authors to clearly emphasize that this issue can be viewed from the perspective of policy regret.
