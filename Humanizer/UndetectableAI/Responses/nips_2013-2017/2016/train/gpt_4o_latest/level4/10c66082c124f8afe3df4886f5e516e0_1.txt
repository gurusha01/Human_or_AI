This document presents a method for metric learning based on the "word movers distance " a type of transport distance used with word embeddings from word2vec technology [19]. The method can be applied to any transport distance that uses squared Euclidean distances post projection application, for generalization purposes while improving performance through learning the linear projection and incorporating a mechanism to learn word specific weights. The weights are customized for the document use case by adjusting the frequency of each word with a trained parameter and then recalibrating the word frequencies accordingly. The study also outlines an optimization process to refine the parameterized metric through training. Extensive practical findings showcase the efficacy of the suggested approach as it is compared against robust benchmarks, across various document classification datasets using a kNN classifier with the refined metric.   
This project expands on the advancements in word movers distance by offering a technically intriguing and practically beneficial expansion that has shown impressive results, in different kNN text classification assignments.   
The effectiveness of the project could be limited since using Earth movers distance along with learning and a starting point of "word centroid distance" gives similar results to the fully learned suggested distance model as shown in the final two rows of Table 3. Overall the key technical advancements, in the paper seem to provide minor enhancements over this initial method that relies on established practices.   
One important point missing from Table 3 is the assessment of the "word centroid embedding," which is calculated as the average of word embeddings for the document when applied alongside all the metric learning methods that were tested (such, as ITML, LMNN and NCA).  
Another thing not considered in the evaluation is looking into how the specific word weights and the projection matrix \( A \) each contribute to the overall results independently would be helpful for understanding their impact, on performance.   
The uniqueness of the work is mostly centered around improving the Lines 156â€“175). Although the idea of metric learning in the context of earth movers distance is interesting on its own accord it is considered a somewhat minor addition, in isolation.
