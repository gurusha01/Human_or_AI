The article presents a feature for LSTM by adding a "time gate," which is controlled based on time and trained parameters independently for each LSTM cell with its unique time gate mechanism, in place. I find it interesting that the paper delves into this concept.  
Technical Standards;   
I'm not sure the design for the time gate is the option right now; maybe we could enhance it by turning the time gate into a function that smoothly changes over time instead? For example we could create a time gate using a broken line function with values, like alpha, one, alpha, zero alpha, one and so on...  
It would be helpful to test the model using a speech recognition standard, for assessment purposes.   
Uniqueness;   
The papers emphasis, on handling events is praiseworthy and contributes to its uniqueness.   
Effect;   
The project is truly inspiring. Shows promise to drive further progress in the field of research and development.The outcomes reveal enhancements, in the evaluated tasks.   
Could you please provide me with context or specific details, about the Clarity issue you are facing?  
It's not clear if the claimed twenty fold decrease, in cost is derived from theoretical analysis or real world hardware tests.
