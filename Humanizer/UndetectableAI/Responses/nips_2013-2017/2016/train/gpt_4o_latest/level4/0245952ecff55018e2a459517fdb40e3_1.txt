This article introduces a network technique that relies on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy criterion for its operation. The effectiveness of this method is tested on small benchmark tasks to assess its ability to distinguish and create data. On the whole' this study adds a perspective to the area of deep learning research focusing on generative models. The language used is quite understandable; however' as is often seen in this field' the mathematical equations may pose some difficulty in comprehension, at points.'The experimental tasks may not be extensive compared to studies in this field but are still within a reasonable range of comparison with others work done before this study was conducted." It would be beneficial to mention in the section about the models training algorithm and the time it takes for training in relation to methods, like DSN. In addition to that point I made on in the text about the papers enhancement. Providing reference code, for the experiments could greatly help practitioners who might struggle with replicating the models precisely as described in the papers model section alone.
