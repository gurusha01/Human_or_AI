In two scenarios that deal with combinations of Gaussian distributions the authors study how the population EM algorithm behaves based on its initial starting points. They also show that the sample based EM algorithm displays long term patterns as the population EM algorithm if both are initiated in the same way. The research focuses on assessing how well the EM algorithm performs for two models that involve a mix of two Gaussian distributions. The results are quite convincing. The analysis thoroughly covers all the important situations regarding the behavior of the EM algorithm, in this specific scenario.The only thing I'd point out is that the proofs seem a bit long for a paper that focuses narrowly just one model.However since theres still much to learn about mixtures of two Gaussian components I think this work should be accepted at NIPS.
