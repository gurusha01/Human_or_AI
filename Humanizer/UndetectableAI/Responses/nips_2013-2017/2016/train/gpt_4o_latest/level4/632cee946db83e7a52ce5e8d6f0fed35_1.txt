The manuscript introduces a technique for reducing dimensionality that involves creating a connection, between SVMs and boosting based on margins.The LADDER algorithm is examined in detail with the aim of discovering a space of smaller dimensions.Although the experimental assessment is somewhat restricted the conversation gives perspectives in the realm of signs.It would be beneficial for the authors to conduct a spell check as there are some typographical errors present.
