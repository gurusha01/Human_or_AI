This article introduces a framework based in information theory to examine and improve crowdsourcing (CS). The main focus is understanding the balance between accuracy and cost in CS systems optimization efforts. In this framework proposed by the authors CS is viewed as a scenario where humans play a role in decision making processes alongside machines; individual workers varying skill levels are likenened to communication channels, with inherent noise. The paper sets out performance limits for CS systems in two situations using rate distortion theory and joint source channel coding. One where worker skill levels are unidentified (SL U.K.) and another where they are known to the crowdsourcer (SL CS). A new query approach called k wise incidence coding (KIC) is. Examined for its error correction abilities and query effectiveness in this study as well as investigates query pricing methods, in this context. 
The study expands upon investigations into the reliability and inference of crowdsourcing methods like majority voting and the Dawid Skene algorithm as well as probabilistic models for assessing worker skills.It goes further by establishing a theoretical basis for comprehending the boundaries of crowdsourcing performance.Utilizing information theory to determine the inquiry rates necessary for specific levels of accuracy represents a valuable addition because it presents a systematic approach, to developing and assessing crowdsourcing systems. 
Advantages; 
The paper establishes a theoretical basis, for designing computer systems in the field of computer science by utilizing established ideas from information theory. 
The new approach idea introduced with kIC is quite creative. Shows its usefulness in a practical way by enhancing error correction through organized queries. 
The report covers limits as well as real world factors like pricing for queries and variations, in worker skills. 
The explanation of the minimum query rates for SL Uk and SL CS scenarios is clear. Offers practical insights, for system designers. 
Areas that need improvement; 
Theoretical results, in the paper are solid; without empirical experiments or simulations to back it up may limit its practical applicability. 
Assumptions about Worker Models; Relying heavily on worker models like the M. Ary symmetric channel (MSC) and spammer hammer channel (SHAC) could restrict the applicability of the findings to actual crowdsourcing platforms, in the real world. 
The discussion, on the practicality of implementing kIC for datasets and complex queries lacks thorough exploration in this context. 
Some parts of the presentation might be hard to follow for readers who're not well versed in information theory; this is especially true, in sections that delve into mathematical derivations. 
Reasons to support acceptance; 
The article tackles an overlooked issue, in crowd sourcing through an original and thorough method. 
Theoretical knowledge plays a role, in pushing the boundaries of computer science system development and improvement. 
The inception of kIC and its examination offer a perspective for crafting queries, in crowdsourcing endeavors. 
Reasons to oppose acceptance; 
The absence of validation leads to doubts regarding the real world usefulness of the theoretical findings. 
The papers applicability to practitioners could be constrained by the assumptions made about worker models and the lack of real world datasets, for validation purposes. 
Suggestion; 
This paper significantly enhances the understanding in the area of crowdsourcing and human involved computation field despite the absence of empirical verification as a drawback; its originality and thoroughness support its acceptance for publication with minor revisions, for clarification and consideration of the practical outcomes of the suggested approaches.
