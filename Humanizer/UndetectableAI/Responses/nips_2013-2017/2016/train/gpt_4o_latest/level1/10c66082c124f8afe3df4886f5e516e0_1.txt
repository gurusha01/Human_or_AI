The research paper introduces a method called Supervised Word Movers Distance (S WMD) an enhanced version of Word Movers Distance ( WMD) to enhance document classification through supervised learning techniques. The authors aim to overcome the nature of WMD by introducing a strategy that involves training an affine transformation in the word embedding space and assigning weights to word importance. This is done through minimizing errors, in stochastic leave one out nearest neighbor classification. The authors use an approach of the optimal transport problem with the Sinkhorn distance instead of directly optimizing WMD in order to address the computational inefficiency issue. They show the effectiveness of S WMD compared to 26 competitive methods, in eight real world text classification tasks achieving top notch outcomes in many instances. 
Advantages; 
The paper is well crafted with a foundation in terms of technical aspects and a straightforward approach for addressing the problem at hand using the Sinkhorn distance method, for approximating WMD gradients effectively tackles the computational hurdles associated with optimizing WMD. 
The paper is nicely. Provides thorough descriptions of the method used including math formulas and pseudo code for the new algorithm proposed in the study. 
The approach taken in this work to integrate supervision into WMD by learning a transformation of word embeddings and assigning specific importance weights to words is unique and innovative The merging of supervised metric learning with optimal transport is a notable advancement, in the field. 
The findings highlight the real world usefulness of S WMD by showing enhancements across various datasets and comparison points.The methods effectiveness and ability for expansion establish it as an asset, for tasks involving text classification. 
Areas that need improvement; 
The effectiveness of S WMD seems greatly influenced by how it's first set up based on the experiments conducted on it so far; inadequate setup may result in less than desirable outcomes observed in specific data collections such, as CLASSIC. 
The S WMD method performs better than the baseline models on datasets but falls short on datasets containing lengthier documents, like BBCSPORT and OHSUMED.This indicates that the method may not apply as effectively across all types of text data. 
The paper lacks an examination of how sensitive S WMD is towards hyperparameters like Î» in the Sinkhorn distance or the batch size, in gradient descent. 
Reasons to Consider; 
The article tackles a drawback of WMD and proposes a sound and effective remedy, for it. 
The results from the experiments are quite impressive as S WMD has shown performance, across the majority of datasets available. 
The approach is well explained. Can be easily replicated since the code has been shared openly for all to access. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The methods effectiveness may be restricted by the need for initialization and its inconsistent performance, on various datasets potentially limiting its practical use. 
The paper would be improved with a look, into how adjusting hyperparameters affects performance outcomes. 
Suggestion; 
This paper greatly enhances the study of measuring document distance. Supervised metric learning in a significant way.The S WMD approach is original and useful as shown by its success, with datasets.I suggest accepting it with some changes focused on the sensitivity of initialization and analysis of hyperparameters.
