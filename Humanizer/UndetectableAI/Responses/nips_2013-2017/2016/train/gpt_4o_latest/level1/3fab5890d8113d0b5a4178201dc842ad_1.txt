The article presents Sparse Access Memory (SAM) a memory enhanced neural network (MANN). It aims to tackle the scalability issues of models, like Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). SAM utilizes sparse read and write processes. Makes use of effective data structures like approximate nearest neighbor (ANN ) indices to achieve significant enhancements in time and space efficiency. The researchers show that SAM is capable of managing memory capacities while staying computationally efficient and delivering significant improvements in speed by up to 1, 600 times and memory usage reductions by up to 3 000 times compared to dense models. Experimental findings indicate that SAM performs similarly or even outperforms models in tasks, like synthetic tasks, curriculum learning, Omniglot one shot classification and Babi reasoning tasks while being able to handle tasks that involve lengthy sequences and extensive memory requirements. 
Advantages
The study showcases a progress in scalable memory augmented neural networks by implementing sparsity in memory access with SAM to achieve notable efficiency gains, in both computation and memory utilization as evidenced by thorough theoretical analysis and practical benchmarks. 
The authors present a range of experimental findings covering various tasks such as synthetic tests and real world data sets, like Omniglot to validate their approach effectively.SAMs capability to adapt to sequences beyond the training length is notably remarkable. 
The paper is nicely organized with descriptions of the structure design process and theoretical assurances, alongside details of the experiments conducted and supplementary materials that offer additional technical insights to support reproducibility efforts. 
The authors effectively place SAM in the context of research like NTMs and Memory Networks and emphasize its benefits in terms of scalability and efficiency The comparisons to dense variants (such as DAMs) as well, as other baseline models further support their arguments. 
Areas of improvement
SAM has shown potential in tasks that're synthetic or semi synthetic; however its effectiveness in tackling more intricate real world areas such, as large scale natural language processing remains largely unexplored. This lack of exploration hinders the relevance and impact of the research done so far.
Sparse Memory Trade offs. The paper does not thoroughly examine the trade offs that sparsity might bring about like its effects on gradient flow or the ability to retain long term memories effectively.While the findings indicate decline in performance a more comprehensive conversation, on this topic would be beneficial. 
The paper briefly touches on the use of artificial neural network (ANNs) such as k d trees and LSH methods; however a more in depth comparison of these approaches and their effects, on training processes would enhance the overall quality of the study. 
The authors touch upon applications and potential developments of SAM but do not delve into the wider impacts of its use beyond the current scope of testing. 
Arguments, in Favor and Against Approval
