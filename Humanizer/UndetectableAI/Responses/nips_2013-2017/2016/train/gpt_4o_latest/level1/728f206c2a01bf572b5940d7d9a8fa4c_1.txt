This article presents a training goal for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) using the Wasserstein distance instead of the usual Kullback Leibler (KL). By utilizing a recognized measurement between data points the writers suggest a Wasserstein distance calculator for RBMs and calculate the gradient of the Wasserstein distance from its alternative representation.The study illustrates that this method results in models with unique statistical features particularly in activities, like filling in missing data and removing noise. The researchers test their approach using datasets such as MNIST and UCI PLANTS and demonstrate that RBMs trained with Wasserstein (referred to as RBM W) produce distributions that are more condensed and sensitive, to metrics when compared to traditional RBMs. 
Advantages; 
Novelty and Originality; Introducing the Wasserstein distance as a training goal for RBMs is an addition, to the field. Even though Wasserstein distances have been studied in areas before applying them to Boltzman machines stands out as an inventive and well reasoned approach. 
The paper demonstrates a theoretical basis by deriving the Wasserstein gradient and contrasting it with the KL gradient while also incorporating sensitivity analysis and utilizing the Sinkhorn algorithm for improved computational efficiency â€“ a notable choice. 
The authors show how their method is useful in completing and cleaning up data for tasks where the distance between observations matters a lot.The results indicate that RBM W performs better than RBMs in these situations paying special attention to managing the trade offs, between bias and variance. 
The paper conducts experiments on various datasets and scenarios to offer insights, into the behavior of RBMs trained using Wasserstein methods.The examination of hyperparameters and the impact of shrinkage enhances the findings substantially. 
Areas of improvement; 
The papers theoretical parts are thorough. Could use clearer explanations, for readers who are not well versed in Wasserstein distances or Boltmann machines." For example " the explanation of the Wasserstein gradient derivation and its consequences could be made understandable."
The experiments mainly concentrate on information and rather small datasets with a question mark, on how well the suggested approach performs with larger or more intricate datasets or continuous data distributions. 
Bias in Distributions; The RBMs trained using Wasserstein often generate condensed distributions resembling clusters that might not fully represent the variety in the data sample. Though this compromise is accepted as trade off in the process; it could constrain the methods usefulness, in situations demanding greater diversity. 
The usage of the Sinkhorn algorithm by the authors in approximating Wasserstein distances increases the complexity when training RBM Ws compared with standard RBMs.This potential increase in costs may pose a challenge for widespread adoption, in large scale applications. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The article presents an well founded method, for training RBMs that pushes the boundaries of generative modeling technology to new heights. 
The real world outcomes show how useful the approach is, in situations that rely heavily upon comparing observations. 
The project introduces possibilities, for incorporating metric aware goals into generative modeling approaches. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The paper would benefit from enhancing its clarity to make it more accessible in explaining the contributions, to a wider audience. 
The scalability and adaptability of the approach, to datasets have not been fully explored yet. 
RBM Ws have a tendency to create distributions that're biased and cluster like which could restrict their overall applicability. 
Suggestion; 
This paper provides an addition to generative modeling and is a good fit, for NIPS conference submission despite some areas that could be enhanced in terms of clarity and scalability.The approachs practical significance outweighs its limitations.I suggest accepting it with revisions to improve clarity and scalability issues.
