The paper presents a Position Based Deep Metric (PBDM) unit to overcome the challenges of conventional worldwide Euclidean distance metrics in deep embedding techniques for visual tasks. The authors suggest that global metrics struggle to grasp the intricacies of feature spaces where distances within classes in densely populated areas might surpass distances between classes, in sparsely populated regions. The PDDM unit they propose learns a similarity measure tailored to feature patterns and facilitates better identification of challenging samples. This component can be easily inserted into neural networks (CNNs) allowing for seamless training from end to end. The researchers show that their approach results in convergence and better outcomes in image search assignments using the CUB 200 2011 and CARS196 datasets. Additionally it demonstrates adaptability, in transfer learning and zero shot learning situations when applied to ImageNet datasets. 
Advantages; 
The new approach in the design of the Personalized Distance and Direction Measurement (PDDM) unit involves a similarity measurement that adjusts locally instead of relying on conventional global metrics such as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distances This unique concept is driven by a strong rationale and effectively fills a noticeable void, within the field. 
The authors thoroughly assess their method through tasks such, as image retrieval and transfer learning to showcase its adaptability and widespread utility. 
The new approach reaches convergence and requires less computation than current methods, like lifted structured embedding. 
Integrating PDDM into CNN models, for optimizing both the feature embeddings together is a key advantage that streamlines the process and boosts overall performance. 
Impressive Outcomes Achieved by the technique surpass methods in Recall performance for image retrieval and demonstrate superior accuracy, in tasks involving transfer and zero shot learning scenarios. Showcasing its real world effectiveness. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper is well written overall; however certain parts like the equations (such, as the double header hinge loss) could be explained more clearly or supported with visuals to make it easier for a wider range of readers to understand. 
The authors mention the effects of embedding loss and batch size in their paper but conducting thorough ablation studies on the design aspects of PDDM (such, as the significance of feature mean vectors) would enhance the papers credibility further. 
The paper criticizes metrics but doesn't thoroughly compare the Performance Difference Distribution Method (PDDM) to other sophisticated non Euclidean or manifold based metrics for a more thorough assessment. 
Scalability is a concern since the method works well for small batches but lacks detailed exploration of its effectiveness with very large datasets or, in real time scenarios. 
Reasons, for Approval; 
The essay deals with an outlined issue using a unique and impactful resolution. 
"It showcases real world outcomes in various complex tasks."
The suggested approach is effective, in real world scenarios. Can be used widely across different visual tasks. 
Reasons Not to Agree; 
The presentation could use some enhancements for clarity, in the theoretical parts. 
There are some concerns about the applicability of the method due to the lack of thorough testing and comparisons, with other metrics. 
I suggest the following; 
This study greatly advances metric learning by introducing a new similarity metric that adjusts locally and offers valuable practical applications despite some minor clarity issues and a need, for further evaluations to enhance clarity and include comprehensive ablation studies.
