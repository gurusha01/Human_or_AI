This study explores how easy it is to perform multiplication and summing out operations on circuits (AC). It also presents a view on Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD) which is considered a type of AC. The researchers show that PSDD allows for multiplication compared to other AC types making them more versatile for various uses; however they lack a fast summing out operation which restrict their effectiveness, for certain tasks needing inference support. The paper suggests a efficient compilation method for probabilistic graphical models by utilizing PSDD multiplication instead of going through intermediate logical representations such as Sentential Decision Diagram (SDD) or d DNNFs. The practical findings demonstrate that PSDD models frequently result in compact representations than other AC based methods do underscoring their effectiveness, in specific situations. 
Advantages; 
The article makes a technical argument about PSDD analysis by showing they are practical for multiplication but have restrictions when it comes to summing out tasksâ€”an important addition, to the field of manageable probabilistic models. 
The incorporation of PSDD multiplication as a polynomial time operation marks a progress in this field of study. Especially considering the difficulties associated with this operation, in other AC classes.The suggested compilation algorithm is also fresh and showcases its practical usefulness. 
The experiments show that PSDD technology offers benefits compared to other methods in terms of size and efficiency through well planned designs and challenging benchmark tests, like the UAI 2014 datasets. 
The theoretical results are clearly explained with proofs and well supported theoretical discussions that make the paper easily understandable for readers knowledgeable, in the field. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The results, from the research look good far but they only focus on certain benchmarks and don't consider how PSDD could be used in practical probabilistic tasks in the real world. 
The drawback of PSDDs incapability to efficiently sum out variables poses a challenge for inference techniques such as variable elimination, in terms of computation time and resources usage. 
The challenge of multiplying in PSDD may be manageable within a time frame but its practical application on extensive models remains uninvestigated to its fullest extent in real world scenarios as highlighted in the paper; discussing potential hindrances could enhance its applicability, in real world settings. 
In comparing to existing research works mentioned in the paper such as ADDS and PDGs are mainly based in theory, with empirical evidence provided to support the claims made. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article discusses an issue, in probabilistic thinking and offers a fresh solution that has both theoretical and practical consequences. 
The new PSDD multiplication operator and compilation algorithm are additions that push the boundaries of current technology forward. 
The practical findings show how PSDDs usefulness in assembling graphical models surpasses current methods, with evident advantages. 
Reasons to oppose approval; 
The constraint of PSDDs capacity to sum out variables limits its usefulness, in extensive inference assignments. 
The assessment is a bit restricted in scope. The ability to apply this method to larger models is still uncertain. 
The paper would be improved by providing a thorough comparison with other representations, in both theoretical and practical scenarios. 
Suggestion; 
This paper significantly enhances the field of probabilistic representations with its valuable insights and innovative approach despite some constraints present, in the studys methodology and design considerations; the potential influence of this research overshadows its limitations and warrants acceptance pending minor adjustments to evaluate its scope fully and delve deeper into related studies.
