The study explores how well underrepresented sparse regression can be retrieved by using the `L₁ norm regularizer with smooth loss functions (L₁ and L∞ norms) building on previous research in the smooth `L₂ case instead of just focusing on that alone like before.The researchers establish criteria for when the support of the retrieved vector stays consistent with a slight increase, in noise and introduce the idea of "extended support" to clarify situations where stability is compromised. Theoretical results are confirmed by conducting tests in compressed sensing to showcase the variations in support stability under different loss functions like `1 ` ̀ and ` ∝. This study expands upon research in sparse recovery such as Fuchs [6] and Zhao and Yu [19] while also focusing non smooth loss functions essential, for dealing with sudden or uniform noise disturbances. 
Advantages
The research paper fills a void, in existing literature by expanding the support recovery theory to handle non smooth loss functions like `l and `∝ (infinity). This adds insights since these loss functions are commonly applied in real world scenarios but currently lack strong theoretical backing. 
The authors present a description of the concept of support stability and instability by utilizing dual certificates and specific injectivity conditions in a thorough manner in their arguments while addressing the difficulties caused by non smoothness, with precision and organization. 
The research has practical applications, in the field of compressed sensing and similar high dimensional inverse problems when dealing with non Gaussian noise situations. 
The experiments show design and effectively demonstrate the theoretical results mentioned earlier in the paper.The analysis of support stability, under loss functions (`L₁` `L₂` `L∝`) provides valuable insights. 
Areas, for improvement
The paper is mathematically detailed and could use clearer explanations for a wider audience to understand better its extended support concept and practical implications. 

The outcomes mainly center around `one` `two` and `infinity` losses in generalization than a broad spectrum of non smooth losses as suggested by the authors without providing evidence, for its applicability. 

Reasons, to Embrace 
The article discusses an issue that has not been thoroughly explored yet and offers fresh theoretical perspectives. 
The findings are thorough and strongly backed by testing. 
The study is expected to encourage exploration into non smooth loss functions, in sparse recovery research. 
Reasons to Object to Approval
The paper could be clearer and more user friendly for readers who're not experts, in the field. 
The scope only applies to situations, with noise levels which limits its real world relevance. 
Questions arise about how applicable the resultsre due, to the absence of real world validation. 
Suggestion
In terms this article provides a solid theoretical addition to the sparse recovery domain and fits well with NIPS. Although there are some limitations regarding extent and clearness the originality and thoroughness of the study surpass these issues. I suggest approval, with recommendations to enhance clarity and incorporate real world validations in research.
