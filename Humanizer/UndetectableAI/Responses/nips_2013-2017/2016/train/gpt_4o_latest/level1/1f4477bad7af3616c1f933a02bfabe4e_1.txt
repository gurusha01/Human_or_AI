This paper presents a method called the nonlinear spectral approach (NLSA) for teaching feedforward neural networks with assurances of achieving global optimality and linear convergence in specific scenarios.The authors show that their approach ensures optimality for neural networks with one or two hidden layers by incorporating non negativity restrictions, on weights and adjusting the objective function.Theoretical findings are backed up by evidence using fixed point theory and the Perron Frobenius framework. Experimental findings on UCI datasets demonstrate outcomes to stochastic gradient descent (SGS) as well as kernel SVMs but with the added advantage of quicker convergence and no requirement, for hyperparameter adjustments. 
Advantages; 
The paper presents a theoretical basis for achieving global optimality, in training neural networks by delving into the intricacies of optimizing non linear problems using innovative nonlinear spectral methods. 
The method suggested in this study is practically feasible and has been tested on real world data sets unlike studies, by Haeffele and Vidal and Janza​min et al. which faced challenges in terms of real world application. 
The experiments, in the study confirm the effectiveness of the method. Show its strong performance compared to SGD and SVMs even though the datasets were limited to low dimensions.The methods linear convergence rate and not needing hyperparameter tuning make it quite attractive. 
The authors have made sure to provide explanations and evidence to make the theoretical contributions easily understandable, for readers while effectively linking them to fixed point theory and spectral radius conditions. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The experiments only focus on datasets and may not fully apply to complex real world issues due to their limited scope, in higher dimensions. 
Architectural limitations include the need for weights to be positive and the use of activation functions such as generalized polynomials, which restrict the models adaptability in comparison to conventional structures, like ReLU networks. 
When evaluating the methods performance against SGD and SVMs in comparison, with global optimization techniques or advanced neural network training methods would provide a more comprehensive analysis of its effectiveness. 
The paper mentions that the spectral radius condition is influenced by the model parameters; however the boundaries given are cautious which might restrict the methods usefulness, for networks or intricate datasets. 
Reasons, in Favor of Approval; 
The article provides a theoretical insight by tackling the issue of achieving global optimality in the training of neural networks – a long standing hurdle, in the discipline. 
"The suggested approach is feasible in real world scenarios. Has been tested on authentic datasets with efficiency, in mind."
The writing is excellent. Provides clear explanations of theoretical findings and experimental methods. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The range of experiments is. It is not certain how well the method works with large datasets or complex networks. 
The limitations posed by the constraints and strict parameter boundaries could potentially impede the practical implementation of this method. 
My suggestion; 
We should consider accepting this paper since it offers an well founded approach to optimizing neural networks with real world applications in mind.However the authors need to look into how scalable and adaptable their method's, for future research endeavors.
