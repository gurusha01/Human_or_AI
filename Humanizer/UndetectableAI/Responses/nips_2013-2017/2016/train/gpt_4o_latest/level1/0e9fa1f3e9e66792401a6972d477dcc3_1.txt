The paper presents an approach called Bounding Divergences with Reverse Annealing (BREAD) which aims to assess the effectiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based algorithms for posterior inference analysis, in a unique way. Expanding on the bidirectional Monte Carlo (BMDC) the authors introduce a method to set a limit on the symmetrized KL divergence (Jeffreys divergence) comparing approximate and true posterior distributions. This technique utilizes annealed importance sampling (AIS) where chains are executed in both forward and reverse directions and is tested using datasets. The integration of BREAD into programming languages like WebPPL and Stan has been showcased in experiments involving different models and datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in real world scenarios by simulating datasets using fitted hyperparameters as proposed by the authors of the paper. This work aims to enhance the accuracy of diagnosing inference quality, in programming and MCMC methods as part of a larger objective. 
Advantages; 
Technical Achievement;The expansion of BDMC to encompass Jeffreys divergence represents a theoretical progression.This approach offers assurances, for synthesized data sets and fills a crucial void in the assessment of MCMC driven inference techniques. 
The authors have made the BREAD method accessible to practitioners by incorporating it into WebPP and Stan software systems.Evidence from experiments show how useful it is, in helping with model representation decisions and debugging programming implementations. 
The paper extensively validates BREAD using both real world data enhancing the methods credibility through the alignment of results, from both types of data sources. 
Novel Applications; Utilizing BREAD to contrast collapsed and uncollapsed model representations provides insights, for individuals utilizing probabilistic programming languages. 
The experiments are well planned. The results are effectively showcased to emphasize the practical implications of the method. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The method is mainly suited for posterior samples and may not be directly applicable to real world data due to limitations in using simulated data as a basis for analysis by the AI model developers who put forward a workaround for real world scenarios but caution that relying on estimated posterior samples could lead to some inaccuracies, in the results obtained. 
Computational Load Issue; Executing both forward and backward AIS chains can be quite demanding computationally wise with extensive models or datasets, in play; the paper doesn't delve deep into the scalability of BREAD. 
The authors briefly touch on related research like [CT16]. They could delve deeper into comparing BREADs strengths and weaknesses in comparison to other methods, for estimating divergence. 
The paper is quite dense. May be challenging to follow in certain sections without prior knowledge of topics, like deriving bounds.The accessibility could be enhanced by providing an more intuitive explanation of the main ideas. 
Reasons, for Approval; 
The article discusses an issue, in probabilistic reasoning and offers a thorough solution backed by theory. 
It shows its usefulness, in real life situations by being integrated into probabilistic programming languages and tested in actual experiments. 
The approach could enhance the standards in assessing and enhancing MCMC based inference methods. 
Reasons to oppose approval; 
The methods usefulness, in real world datasets is restricted by depending on precise posterior samples. 
The expense involved in using this method could prevent its use, for handling large scale issues. 
The paper would be improved with an explanation and a more thorough comparison, to existing research studies. 
Suggestion; 
The paper makes a valuable contribution to the area of probability inference and programming with its strengths outweigh the limitations, in scope and scalability despite revisions needed for clarity and addressing computational issues.
