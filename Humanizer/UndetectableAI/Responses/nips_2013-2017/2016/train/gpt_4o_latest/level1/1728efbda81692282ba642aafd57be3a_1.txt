The article introduces a method, for analyzing the spectral characteristics of the Koopman operator within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). It presents a decomposition technique that utilizes short sequences of real world data to capture key attributes of complex dynamical systems with non linear behavior patterns. The approach expands upon the principles of Mode Decomposition (DMD) adapting it to RKHS and integrating non linear basis functions using kernel techniques for a more comprehensive representation of Koopman eigenfunctions compared to conventional linear monomial based DMD approaches. The writers also discuss real world obstacles like conditions by presenting a more resilient version that uses Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). They showcase the suggested approach through tasks like forecasting states and detecting changes, in patterns dynamically using both simulated and real data sets. 
Advantages; 
The paper provides a contribution through expanding Koopman spectral analysis to RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces). This extension improves the methods flexibility and effectiveness, in addressing dynamics. 
Enhancing durability is key, in the algorithm that incorporates POD bases to overcome a major drawback of conventional DMD techniques by boosting numerical stability and real world usability. 
The study showcases how the suggested approach can be applied in ways such as forecasting future trends and identifying shifts, in data patterns dynamically through real world and synthetic data analysis results. 
The mathematical framework is presented clearly with explained derivations and step, by step algorithm explanations. 
The work is current and significant since spectral methods and Koopman operator theory are now widely applied in machine learning well as, in the fields of physics and engineering. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The real life testing conducted lacks comparisons with the latest advanced techniques like extended DMD or other kernel based methods to measure improvements, in performance accurately and effectively. 
Scalability is a concern with the suggested approach as it lacks a discussion of computational complexity when dealing with big datasets or complex systems at higher dimensions This could restrict its practical use, in real world situations. 
The method is tested using real world data. The examples are limited in scope; conducting broader experiments, with diverse and complex datasets would enhance the credibility of the papers assertions. 
In some applications like predicting preimages and detecting change points in data sets are a bit hard to understand for people who're not familiar, with these methods It would be helpful to add more explanations or visual aids to make it easier for readers to grasp the concepts involved. 
Reasons to Consider; 
The article presents an well founded expansion of Koopman spectral analysis that adds significant value, to the field. 
The improved algorithm overcomes a drawback of current approaches and improves its practicality, for users. 
The examples showcase how the technique could make a difference in fields. 
Reasons Not to Agree; 
The experimental assessment has some limitations as it lacks comparisons and analysis of scalability. 
The real world testing is limited in scope. Some of the explanations, for applications could use more clarity. 
Suggestion; 
My suggestion is to approve with some changes needed to enhance the papers impact and address the experimental limitations while adding more clarity, to the application sections for a stronger theoretical and methodological contribution.
