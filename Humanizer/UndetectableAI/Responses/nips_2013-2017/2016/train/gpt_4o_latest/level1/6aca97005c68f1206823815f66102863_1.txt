This study presents a method for making likelihood free inferences through Bayesian conditional density estimation to overcome challenges associated with Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques (ABC). The researchers suggest using neural networks to learn a parametric representation of the posterior instead of relying on sample based approximations, in traditional ABC methods. By utilizing simulation data to improve the approximation iteratively in their approach reduces the number of simulations needed compared to conventional ABC methods significantly. The study showcases how effective the method is through experiments involving simple tasks as well as more intricate models such as Lotka Volterra and M/G/l queue models in addition to Bayesian linear regression and toy problems. Their findings indicate that the suggested approach surpasses ABC regarding precision and effectiveness in situations, with limited or non Gaussian distributions.
