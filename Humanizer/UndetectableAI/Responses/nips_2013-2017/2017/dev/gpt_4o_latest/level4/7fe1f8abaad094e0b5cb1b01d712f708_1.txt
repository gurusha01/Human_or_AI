Summary of Review;   
The paper discusses the challenge of tackling two player zero sum games with information like poker by introducing two innovative ideas that stand out to me. "Reach " aiming to capitalize on any advantage or "gift" gained from the opponents previous errors, during the game and "Nested," involving real time re solving of subgames with more comprehensive information. In particular although the initial game can be solved in theory this method enables accurate solutions when facing smaller subgames while playing.
I have a viewpoint.  
While I may not have a knowledge of game solving and poker playing algorithms in literature the paper seems to be well crafted and offers interesting insights and important advancements in the field. One noticeable drawback is the explanation and exploration of the novel techniques’ impacts, beyond technical aspects, which made it difficult for me to completely evaluate their significance.. What really made the paper exceptional was how these methods played a crucial role in securing the initial win against skilled human players in no limit hold'em poker—a significant achievement for AI, in general. 
I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this subject!  
Understanding why "Reach" is advantageous proved challenging for me—particularly grasping how identifying an error by Player 1 earlier in the game tree leads to enhancements, within a subgame area would be beneficial as it appears to constitute a pivotal element of the papers advancements.
