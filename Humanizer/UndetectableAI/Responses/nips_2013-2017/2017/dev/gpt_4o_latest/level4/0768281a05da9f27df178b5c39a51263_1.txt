"Overview. Recap"  
This study presents a method called hyperalignment that replaces basic functions with neural networks in a system similar, to kernel hyperalignment.The effectiveness of this approach was tested on real world FMRI datasets and showed better classification accuracy and decreased computational time compared to another deep learning model. 
"Thoughts, on this?"  
The uniqueness of the suggested approach is not clearly defined in this context.It seems like the method integrates aspects from research work.Is there a rise in complexity, in the optimization problem when switching from basis functions to neural networks? Furthermore it seems that the optimization process is greatly influenced by studies.

The main aim of alignment is to match subjects based on their characteristics to accommodate variations between individuals effectively.The best method to verify enhanced correspondence is by showing the improved alignment of activation patterns among subjects.However the employment of a classification task for assessment in this research study presents challenges in distinguishing whether the enhanced performance arises from alignment or merely a more exceptional functional representation.Additionally it remains uncertain how the aligned data can be linked back to the anatomical framework, for clarity and understanding. 
Could the results be significantly impacted by the fact that G's not unique? 
The results that are mentioned could be influenced by overfitting or bias because they only show the performance for various parameter values instead of using proper nested cross validation methods to reduce errors and ensure accuracy, in model evaluation processes with higher flexibility options that tend to yield superior results in similar scenarios where the selection of parameter values greatly impacts the overall outcomes. 
Is it still effective to skip anatomical alignment when using functional hyperalignment or does skipping spatial normalization impact the performance improvement observed?
