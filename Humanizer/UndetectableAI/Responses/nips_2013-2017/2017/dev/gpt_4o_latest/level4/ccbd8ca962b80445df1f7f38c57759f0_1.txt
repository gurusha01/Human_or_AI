The paper presents a method to improve the "Linear Fascicle Evaluation model" (LiFE) which is often used in analyzing tractography in MRI scans but struggles with computational scalability issues when handling full resolution MRI data efficiently. The authors suggest an approximation technique using a Tucker model (tensor decomposition) to overcome this challenge. They offer support, for the effectiveness and compression capabilities of the proposed method, which is also confirmed through experimental testing. The suggested model and its analysis seem strong to me overall; nonetheless I do have reservations regarding the coverage of the evaluation of the model for tractography in the paper – it only spans a few lines of text which I find lacking depth. Given the constraints imposed by the page limits of a NIPS paper, on the authors’ capacity to offer a more thorough evaluation I am willing to overlook this deficiency. 
The paper is really well written and easy to understand with intuitive visuals that help the reader follow along easily even for someone like me who isn't well versed in tractography or tensor models specifically; I found it quite accessible and engaging to read despite my lack of expertise, in those areas. 
Some minor feedback (not crucial, for the response);
In line 36 of the text mentioned by the authors they point out that tractography is not well understood and that different methods often produce varied outcomes. They go on to suggest using models due to this inconsistency in results. I personally find this rationale unconvincing—differences in outcomes are probably due, to modeling assumptions rather than whether a universal best solution has been reached. 
The authors of this paper have taken the time to elucidate the points of their arguments in a clear and straightforward manner—a practice that is sometimes neglected by other writers.I appreciate the effort they have put into this as it greatly improves the readability of the paper.Thank you for this approach! 
In line 195 of the document is a sentence that reads "...dataset depicted in Fig 4.a." It appears that the reference, to the figure might be more appropriate if placed within parentheses instead. 
I noticed a typo in line 202; "aproach" should be corrected to "approach.”

Upon consideration of the rebuttal and additional reviews provided to me I stand by my suggestion that this paper ought to be approved.
