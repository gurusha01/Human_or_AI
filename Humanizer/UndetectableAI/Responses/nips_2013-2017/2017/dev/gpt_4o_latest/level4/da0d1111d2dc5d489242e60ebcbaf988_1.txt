This study delves into the realm of convex optimization with constraints that change over time with a focus on minimizing regret and maintaining bounded violations of stochastic constraints efficiently. The authors address this challenge in scenarios where constraints are either fixed or stochastic and manage to achieve bounds of \(\sqrt{T}\log T\) for both regret and constraint violation by making reasonable assumptions about the constraints in place. This breakthrough marks an advancement compared to the previous \( T^{3/4}\) boundary, for constraint violations that was widely recognized. Initial tests have been conducted with a job scheduler to validate the theoretical discoveries presented. 
The issue discussed in the paper is. Well supported by reasoning; even though it has been somewhat investigated in previous research efforts. Nonetheless The paper showcases a progress by enhancing the established limitations concerning both regret and breaches of constraints. The exposition is generally understandable. The mentioned advancements are situated within the context of existing literature. The paper adequately reviews studies. Considering the writing quality the paper is fairly well crafted, with an organization and language use. The argument seems valid, from a standpoint and the evidence seems accurate according to the verifications I conducted (albeit I didn't have enough time to fully inspect the Appendix yet. I intend to give it an assessment during the rebuttal stage).
In short the paper presents a viewpoint on online linear optimization with constraints calling for a new analytical method. Although the specific design of the feedback could use convincing rationale the general idea of prioritizing long term constraint infractions instead of depending on expensive ( and at times impractical ) projections, in online learning is intriguing and well supported.
