I waited for the signal, at the crossing.   
The writers claim that the 1 bit method for calculating averages is tailored for communication purposes. However what sets this apart, from the randomizer discussed in reference [2] particularly in its application to a single element? If the process does indeed mirror the randomizer outlined in reference [2] given specific circumstances it is important to clearly explain this similarity. 
The second theorem  
Could you please compare the usefulness of n and d in relation, to the histogram procedures?
Section 3 point 4  
The extent of privacy assurances post alpha point rounding is not entirely clear yet in the scenario where a collector repeatedly submits their dataset (for example N times). The privacy budget needs to be recalibrated following the composition guidelines in such cases. Although alpha point rounding introduces randomness, to the responses which may boost privacy somewhat; the composition theorem remains relevant as long as the collector offers multiple responses.
