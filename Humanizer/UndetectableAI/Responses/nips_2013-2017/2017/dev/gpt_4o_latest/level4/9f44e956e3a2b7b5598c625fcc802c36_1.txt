The writers present a method called the IBAG algorithm for active sequential learning purposes.The main idea is that it requires basic knowledge of a specific set of target actions included in the framework.They offer a theoretical background and assessment of their technique revealing that it outperforms the benchmark method (Chernoffs algorithm) in various situations. 
I think this paper adds value to the research on hypothesis testing in active learning and situations, with limited information.
