The paper presents a technique for determining a common representation of several weighted finite automata (WFAs) using multitask spectral learning methodology in a fresh approach with vector valued WFAs to extract a unified feature space through spectral learning techniques. The effectiveness of this method is tested on datasets (randomly created WFAs) as well as on practical datasets (learning tasks across 33 languages) illustrating that the multitask approach surpasses single task learning methods, in performance assessment. This study seems to be the attempt at investigating a multitask learning strategy, for WFAs. 
The paper raises concerns about the lack of in depth discussion on the context and motivation behind learning (SL) of WFAs at the outset without adequately addressing when SL WFA is suitable or its advantages compared to other algorithms.It critiques the work section, for not sufficiently justifying why the proposed approach is superior and notes that the evaluation mainly contrasts SL WFAs with multitask SL WFAs (M SL WFAs).This comparison clearly shows the advantages of multitask learning compared to single task learning. Fails to explain why the suggested method M SL is preferable, to other options available. 
Although there are some worries surrounding the issue mentioned above in the papers content regarding determining feature maps using a meticulously crafted approach with potential uses in fields related to finite state machines (as demonstrated in tasks involving language) the method is backed by theoretical assurances such, as maximum limit conditions and an examination of computational intricacies.
