In their paper presented here the authors introduce the Batch Renormalization technique to overcome the limitations of batch normalization (batchnorm) especially when dealing with non i.i.d mini batches in a neural network setting. Reducing the dependency on mini batches is crucial for various applications especially when training big neural network models, with limited GPU memory capacity. The suggested approach is both easy to grasp and simple to put into practice. Experiments indicate that Batch Renormalization performs well with i.i.d mini batches and enhances the performance of small mini batches compared to batchnorm. 
The writers start by giving an overview of batch normalization and pointing out its main drawbacks; the variations in mean and variance between training and inference stages and its lack of stability when used with small minibatches.. Although applying moving averages for normalization may appear like a fix to this issue it can lead to the model diverging.. To tackle this problem the authors suggest an approach called Batch Renormalization that merges the minibatch mean and variance, with moving averages. From my perspectiveiBatch Renormalization shifts, from the batch normalization method that uses the mini batch mean and variance to a modified version that heavily depends on moving averages instead.iThis gradual shift enables the model to harness the advantages of using moving averages while ensuring consistent convergence. 
I do have some questions, about this project though.   
When working with a minibatch size like 32 why doesn't Batch Renormalization show much improvement compared to batchnorm? It seems that maintaining mean and variance values, between training and inference doesn't offer many advantages in this situation.   
The results from the experiments show that when using a minibatch size (batch size of 4) the performance is not as good as when using a larger minibatch size (batch size of 32). Would it be beneficial to use two (or more than two ) moving averages for mean and variance with update rates (for instance one with 0.. Another, with 0.01 ) to tackle this issue? A lower update rate could help reduce the inconsistency problem while a higher update rate might address the challenges linked with minibatch sizes.   
The research paper does not present findings on the impact of hyperparameters \( r{\text{{max}}} \) and \( d{\text{{max}}} \), on performance suggesting that extensive parameter adjustments might be necessary. 
This work is well done overall. I am excited to witness a more polished and sophisticated resolution to this issue, down the line.
