This paper presents a measure called the split sample growth rate to evaluate sample complexity and its use in examining the generalization error of empirical risk minimization (ERM). The authors demonstrate that the expected generalization error can be constrained by \(O(\sqrt{\log(\taû H (2 m))/ m})\) where \(\taû H ( m )\) denotes the split sample growth rates value function This metric streamlines the assessment of sample complexity, across scenarios and notably in optimal auction design while refining the Rademacher complexity framework structurally. The paper also uses this method to calculate sample complexity limits for types of auctions and achieves outcomes that are on par with or superior, to previous studies that utilized pseudo dimension or Rademacher complexity measures. 
Advantages
The concept of split sample growth rate introduces an broadly applicable idea that enhances current analyses based on Rademacher complexity theory.Its relevance goes beyond auction design to encompass aspects of statistical learning theory presenting a potentially significant contribution. 
The suggested method makes it easier to calculate sample size limits for auction scenarios like single item auctions, with player specific reserves by using simple counting methods. 
The paper offers theoretical insights by presenting a key theorem that limits the generalization error through the growth rate of split samples effectively tying in with local Rademacher complexity and the hypothesis space, with clarity and detail. 
The research highlights how the measure can be applied in real world auction situations by studying types of auctions involving multiple items and bidders and showing advancements compared to previous studies, in certain instances. 
Results clarity is top notch here; the boundsre explained step by step with a clear intuition that makes it easy for readers familiar, with statistical learning theory to understand. 
Areas, for improvement
The paper makes theoretical contributions but falls short in providing real world empirical experiments to confirm the usefulness of the split sample growth rate, in practical scenarios or different learning tasks outside of auctions. 
Rely on high probability constraints with Markovs inequality than McDiarmids inequality for better confidence parameter dependency (\(1/\delta\), versus logarithmic dependence). The drawback is. Not completely resolved in standard Rademacher complexity evaluations. 
The range of applications is wide according to the split sample growth rate assertion; however the main emphasis of the paper is on auction design mainly.Adding instances from various fields could make a stronger argument, for its overall usefulness. 
Assumptions regarding ERM suggest that the outcomes are influenced by characteristics of the ERM procedure, like tie breaking regulations that might not apply universally across all learning scenarios. 
Arguments for and, against acceptance
Strengths; 
A new and well founded method, for estimating sample complexity is introduced in the paper. 
Simplifies the examination of issues, in designing auctions. 
Some enhancements are offered compared to efforts, in certain situations. 
It links with measures of complexity such, as Rademacher complexity and pseudo dimension. 
Downsides; 
The validation is limited. There are few examples, beyond auction design. 
The upper limits with less, than probabilities are a result of depending on Markovs inequality. 
Relying much on certain aspects of ERM could restrict its overall applicability. 
Advice
The paper brings a theoretical insight by introducing the concept of split sample growth rate and showing its usefulness, in auction design and statistical learning theory aspects.The absence of verification and wider applications is a drawback; however the originality and precision of the theoretical findings justify approval.I suggest accepting it with modifications to enhance the clarity of assumptions and explore potential expansions to other fields.
