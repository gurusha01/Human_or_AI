In this paper introduces methods for gathering counter data multiple times while preserving local differential privacy (LDP). This tackles an issue with current LDP algorithms where privacy protection diminishes quickly during continuous data collection situations. The authors suggest approaches for estimating mean and histogram that privacy assurances consistently over extended periods of data collection and deliver accuracy on par, with or surpass single round LDP methods. The research paper discusses three advancements. (1)Simplified 1 bit response methods for gathering data in a single round,(2)a new α point rounding method for memoization to safeguard privacy during repeated data collection and (3)application of these methods, by Microsoft to gather telemetry data from a vast number of devices.Theoretical findings are confirmed through assessments using real life data sets that showcase the effectiveness and reliability of these mechanisms. 
Advantages; 
The paper fills a void in the field of Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by suggesting methods to enhance privacy protections in situations where data collection is done repeatedly; The α point rounding method stands out for its creativity in finding a balance between privacy and precision by drawing inspiration, from approximation algorithms. 
The authors have clearly defined privacy guarantees. Outlined the LDP properties, for multiple data collections with a strong theoretical basis reflected in their proofs and boundaries that establish the accuracy and privacy of their methods. 
The practical relevance of Microsofts implementation of the suggested methods demonstrates their usefulness and ability to scale in real world scenarios effectively.They have proven to be effective in handling data collection from a number of devices, in large scale environments. 
In trials using real world and artificial datasets, the effectiveness and resilience of the mechanisms have been confirmed across different distributions and parameter configurations with the outcomes consistently indicating that the new techniques surpass or are as good as the latest one round LDP mechanisms available, in the field. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper is well written overall. Certain parts that explain α point rounding and memoization techniques are quite complex and may be hard to understand for some readers.A clearer explanation or illustrative examples could make it easier for readers to grasp the concepts being discussed. 
The evaluations scope is restricted to app usage telemetry data mainly; although this is a scenario to consider, conducting broader assessments encompassing other fields, like healthcare or financial data could enhance the overall applicability of the findings. 
The paper recognizes that maintaining privacy when collecting data repeatedly is more challenging compared to collecting data only. However it suggests delving into the consequences of this compromise especially in situations where there may be additional information available, to potential adversaries.
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The article discusses an overlooked issue in the LDP sector and adds valuable insights, to the field. 
The suggested approaches are theoretically solid. Supported by evidence in practice as well as in academia and industry showing their impact, in both realms. 
The research pushes boundaries by introducing methods that strike a balance, between safeguardi​ng privacy and maximizing usefulness in situations where data collection is frequent​ly required​. 
Reasons to Refuse; 
Some people might find it hard to understand technical parts because they are complex and not explained clearly enough for everyone to grasp easily. 
The assessment could be improved by testing it in a range of situations to show how well it applies in different contexts. 
Suggestion; 
In terms this document offers a valuable addition to the realm concerning differential privacy specifically when dealing with recurring data gathering activities. Though there are some points about clarity and range that could be improved upon; the positives exceed the negatives considerably. I suggest accepting it with adjustments to enhance clarity and to delve further into the conversation, about balancing privacy with utility trade offs.
