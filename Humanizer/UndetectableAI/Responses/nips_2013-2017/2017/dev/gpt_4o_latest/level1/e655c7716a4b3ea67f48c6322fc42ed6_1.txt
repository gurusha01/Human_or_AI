This study presents an approach to multitask learning for weighted finite automata (WFAs) incorporating vector valued WFAs (vv WFAs). The researchers suggest a learning method for vv WFAs that simultaneously tackles several connected tasks to encourage the identification of a common representation space. Key aspects of this work involve establishing a metric, for task relatedness and expanding the Fliess theorem to vector valued functions while introducing a reliable multitask spectral learning algorithm (MT SL). The advantages of the suggested method are proven through tests conducted with both real data collections which highlight enhanced results, in situations requiring multitasking skills especially when tasks have significant similarities. 
Advantages; 
The incorporation of vv WFA as an extension of WFAs represents an innovation within the field of multitask learning for sequence based assignments and fills a previously identified void, in existing research literature. 
The paper demonstrates a theoretical foundation by applying the Fliess theorem to vector valued functions and introducing a measure of relatedness as part of its analysis methodology. 
The suggested algorithm is both efficient and adaptable in real world situations like the Universal Dependencies PoST tagging dataset demonstration indicates usefulness of MT SL in situations, with sparse target task data. 
The practical testing shows that multitask learning with vv WFAs offers benefits when dealing with both simulated and actual data sets. Especially in scenarios with limited data availability. The thorough and well reasoned comparison against baseline techniques, like SL and SL baggings further supports these findings. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The theoretical parts are thorough. Might be tough for those not well versed in spectral learning or tensor algebra to grasp easily.The paper could be improved by adding intuitive explanations and visual aids to help readers understand better. 
Limited investigation into the concept of relatedness is noted in the research findings without an examination conducted during the experiments regarding the τ measures impact on performance within MT SL when different levels of relatedness, between tasks are considered. 
The research paper primarily contrasts MT SL with task spectral learning (SL) as well as a simplistic SL bagged method suggesting that incorporating comparisons with alternative multitask learning techniques, like neural networks or Bayesian methods could enhance the practical assessment. 
The paper discusses the uses of vv WFAs in various areas, like reinforcement learning; however; the tests only cover sequence modeling tasks which restricts showcasing the full range of capabilities of vv WFAs. 
Reasons to Support Approval; 
The article presents an well supported addition, to multitask learning for sequential data—a field that has not been thoroughly investigated. 
The theoretical understandings are solid. Build upon the current research, in spectral learning. 
The real world data supports the effectiveness of the suggested method showcasing its advantages in practice. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The complex theoretical content might make it difficult for a wider range of people to understand. 
I suggest broadening the scope of the assessment to encompass a wider range of baseline models and practical uses. 
Suggestion; 
In terms this research paper makes a noteworthy impact in the realm of multitasking learning and spectral techniques. Although there are areas that could use clarity and broader evaluation the originality and thoroughness of the study support its approval. I suggest accepting it with adjustments to enhance clarity and broaden comparisons, with baseline models.
