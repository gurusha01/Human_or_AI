This study presents an attention component designed for recognizing actions in tasks and suggests a straightforward yet impactful approach to incorporating attention into deep neural networks effectively. The researchers show that their attention system enhances performance across three known benchmarks. MPII HICO and HMDB51. With significant results whether trained with or, without extra supervision. Of note is the considerable 12 0 percent upgrade achieved on the MPII dataset thanks to this proposed technique which sets a fresh benchmark in this field. The article also offers a viewpoint by presenting the attention mechanism as a simplified version of second order poolingâ€”a connection that bridges action recognition, with fine grained classification challenges.This combination of experimentation and theoretical analysis represents a significant advantage of the research work. 
Advantages; 
The study is well founded in terms of technology and excellence; it provides an explanation of how attention mechanisms serve as a low rank approximation of second order pooling. The research includes a range of experiments across various datasets and baseline models. The outcomes are convincing as they demonstrate enhancements, in performance across different tasks. 
The paper is nicely. Structured with easy to understand descriptions of the method being suggested along, with its theoretical basis and how it is put into practice.The explanation of the attention mechanism stands out as well articulated which helps readers grasp the approach easily. 
The concept of presenting focus as rank second order pooling is innovative and offers a new angle on attention mechanisms. Additionally the merging of lower level saliency with higher level attention is an addition influenced by studies, in neuroscience literature. 
The findings show that the suggested attention module is an effective enhancement for recognizing actions as it enhances performance without requiring significant computational resources making it a beneficial feature, for current frameworks. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper briefly touches on full rank pooling and higher rank approximations without delving deep into exploring these alternatives thoroughly enough to truly understand their potential benefits and limitations.The work could be strengthened by conducting an, in depth analysis of the situations where higher rank approximations could prove advantageous. 
In datasets like MPII the paper highlights concerns about overfitting when employing class specific attention maps. Although this concern is recognized it would be beneficial to delve into strategies, for addressing this limitation. 
The paper suggests that its approach offers an option to sequential attention models like LSTMs but it lacks direct comparisons, with these models, which would enhance the evaluations depth and breadth. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The research paper presents an well supported method, for incorporating attention into the process of recognizing actions. 
The outcomes are impressive as they show top notch performance, across benchmarks. 
It's easy to put into practice. Doesn't require a lot of computational power. So it can be used in many different situations. 
Reasons to not agree with; 
Exploring higher level approximations and alternatives could use an, in depth investigation. 
There is a gap in the evaluation due to the absence of comparisons, with sequential attention models. 
Suggestion; 
 I suggest approving this document for publication as it offers contributions in terms of both theoretical understanding and real world applications while tackling a crucial issue, in computer vision field.Although there are areas that could be enhanced the merits of the research surpass its limitations.
