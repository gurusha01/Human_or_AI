The article introduces PROASAGGA. An optimization algorithm created for handling composite objective functions in an asynchronous parallel manner by blending variance reduction techniques with support, for nonsmooth objectives. Expanding upon the SAGGA algorithms framework PROASAGGA overcomes the drawbacks commonly associated with asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approaches like HOGFREEZE that are primarily geared towards smooth objectives. The researchers suggest a proximal version of SAGGA and adapt it for asynchronous operations showcasing both theoretical advancements and practical enhancements compared with cutting edge techniques available today. The research paper offers assurances of convergence by demonstrating that PROXBELCHA progresses at a faster pace with specific conditions related to sparsity and delay, in mind; furthermore it confirms its efficiency through trials conducted on extensive datasets. 
Advantages; 
The papers key innovation lies in expanding variance reduced gradient techniques to handle asynchronous and nonsmooth scenarios—a novel approach that addresses a substantial gap, in existing research which previously overlooked these dual challenges. 
The authors offer convergence proofs and establish the circumstances in which PROXCASAG achieves linear acceleration citing the "perturbed iterate framework " and the bounded overlap assumption, which is well supported and consistent with recent progress, in asynchronous optimization. 
The practical testing proves PROXASAGAs superiority over existing methods like ASYS PCD and FISTA by a margin in runtime, for challenging sparse problems. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to follow with clear explanations on the algorithms workings and theoretical analysis alongside the setup for experiments provided in a straightforward mannerthe addition of practical details like memory compression is beneficial for those, in the field. 
Areas, for improvement; 
Assumptions about Sparsity; The algorithms effectiveness largely depends on the sparsity of gradients and the separability of blocks in the terms context. While this assumption is valid for machine learning scenarios it does constrain the overall applicability of the method. The authors recognize this constraint. Do not delve into potential adaptations, for dense environments. 
The algorithms need to keep track of gradients and adjust block weights adds extra memory usage that could be a limiting factor for very complex problems, with high dimensions. 
The paper extensively compares PROxASAGa with ASYSpcD and various other techniques; nevertheless further experiments, on sparse datasets are recommended to gain a deeper insight into the constraints of PROxASAGa under less ideal conditions. 
Practical Acceleration Note; While the expected increase in speed's linear in theory the actual runtime boost tends to be less, than linear because of additional time spent on memory access. Further investigation could delve into optimizing for hardware configurations. 
Reasons, for Approval; 
The article discusses an overlooked issue, in optimizing nonsmoother objectives asynchronously. 
The new algorithm offers theoretical support and shows notable practical enhancements compared to current approaches. 
The project is expected to make an impact since it expands variance reduced techniques to a broader range of issues and is useful, for handling large scale machine learning projects. 
Reasons Not to Agree; 
The methods overall usefulness is restricted by its dependence, on assumptions. 
The actual acceleration is somewhat limited by the time needed for memory access tasks that might lessen the attractiveness of the algorithm in specific real life situations. 
Here is a suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted as it adds significantly to the field of optimization and sets a groundwork for future exploration of asynchronous approaches for non smooth objectives despite certain constraints present, in the research findings; the advantages of this study surpass its drawbacks and are expected to stimulate additional investigation and real world use cases.
