This study discusses the issue of solving subgames in games with information by introducing new strategies that surpass previous methods in both theory and practice remarkably well. The researchers introduce Reach subgame solving as a solution which considers the connections between subgames by including opponent strategies and possible results from sections of the game tree. They also expand the methods for solving subgames to address opponent actions outside of the game tree through nested subgame solving. A method that proves to be more effective, than the conventional action translation technique. The methods played a role in the creation of Libratus. The inaugural AI to outsmart elite human competitors in heads up no limit Texas Hold'em poker. Marking a notable achievement, in AI exploration. 
This study expands on research in solving subgames like Unsafe Subgame Solving and Resolving by tackling their shortcomings. Unsafe Subgame Solving lacks theoretical assurances while Resolving is safe but may overlook chances for enhancement. The Reach subgame solving method enhances these aspects by accounting for "gifts " which're potential value variances resulting from different actions and aiming to decrease exploitable situations, in all subgames. The innovative nested subgame solving approach pushes the boundaries of the field by allowing reactions to off tree actions in games with extensive or ongoing action optionsâ€”a crucial feature to have. Additionally the authors present a wealth of evidence showcasing the effectiveness of their approaches, in various poker scenarios and underscoring their real world applicability. 
Advantages; 
The paper is well researched. Offers solid theoretical support, for solving Reach subgames while also showing how it enhances safety and reduces exploitability effectively. 
Influence; These methods have been effectively utilized in a prominent real world scenario (Libratus) demonstrating their importance and relevance. 
The authors conduct assessments by performing in depth experiments that compare their techniques with existing methods using specific metrics like exploitability measured in milliblinds, per hand and demonstrating strong and reliable outcomes. 
5. Innovation ; The integration of Reach subgame solving and nested subgame solving marks a progression from previous approaches tackling important challenges, in the field. 
The paper is nicely. Gives enough context to help readers who are familiar, with game theory and games involving imperfect information understand the contributions made. 
Areas of improvement; 
Implementations can be tricky due to the complexity of the process and the need, for resources when it comes to incorporating these techniques into big games. 
The techniques are shown in poker. Their usefulness in other imperfect information fields, like cybersecurity or auctions is not thoroughly investigated. 
Gift Splitting Heuristic Mentioned in the paper is that the distribution of gifts across subgames may not always be ideal and that the heuristic employed could affect performance, in scenarios.It may benefit from refinement or examination. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The document outlines a progress in strategies for solving subgames in games, with imperfect information. 
The approaches have been thoroughly. Have shown significant theoretical and real world accomplishments which notably contribute to AI research progress. 
The research aligns well with the interests of the NeurIPS community as it delves into areas of game theory and AI while also exploring topics, in reinforcement learning. 
Reasons to Refuse; 
The proposed methods might be challenging for researchers who don't have resources due, to their high computational requirements. 
Focusing solely on pokers impact might limit how the contributions are viewed in a context. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted as it offers impactful contributions to the field by improving imperfect information game solving and showing practical achievements, in real world scenarios despite a few minor limitations that don't greatly diminish the overall quality and significance of the study.
