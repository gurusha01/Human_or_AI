This research paper presents Deep Hyperalignment (DHA) a deep learning method for align the functions in analyzing multi subject brain imaging (fMRI). DHA tackles the issues present in current Hyperalignment (HA) such as dealing with nonlinearity and scaling up to analyze large amounts of datasets effectively. Unlike techniques like Kernel Hyperalignment (KHA ) or Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) DHA uses a parametric deep kernel function that utilizes neural networks, with multiple layers to allow for flexible nonlinear transformations. The optimization framework suggested utilizes rank m Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which guarantees computational processing and eliminates the necessity for training information when aligning new subjects in various subjects areas.Empirical findings exhibit DHAs performance in categorization assignments across diverse fMRI datasets in comparison, to cutting edge HA techniques. 
Advantages; 
DHA brings in an approach with deep learning at its core to create a versatile kernel function that can be adjusted to different subjects needs effectively overcoming the constraints associated with rigid kernel functions found in techniques such, as KHA. 
Ensuring efficiency for datasets with multiple subjects is possible through the utilization of rank m SVD and SGD, in DHA methodology. 
Extensive experimental results are presented in the paper across datasets to show notable enhancements in classification accuracy and runtime when compared to standard methods and the latest approaches, for HA (Hypothetical Analysis) techniques. 
DHAs practical usefulness lies in its capability to synchronize functions without the need for training data in real world scenarios giving it a significant edge, for application purposes. 
The paper does a job of explaining how DHA differs from previous works, like RHA, KHA and CAI while emphasizing its distinctive contributions. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The technical information is comprehensive. Could be difficult for readers new, to HA methods or deep learning because of the complicated math and extra materials provided. 
The paper fails to address the possible drawbacks of DHA including its responsiveness, to hyperparameter adjustments and the clarity of the acquired deep representations. 
The paper could improve by comparing DHA with HA approaches or other deep learning methods for fMRI analysis in addition to the existing comparisons, with several HA methods. 
DHA has been proven to be effective in analyzing fMRI data; however its effectiveness in analyzing neuroimage modalities, like EEG remains unexplored. 
Reasons, to Support; 
The article discusses an issue in alignmenderitit and suggests a well thought out and creative solution technically. 
DHA shows enhancements compared to current methods, in terms of both effectiveness and speed advancing the current technology to a new level. 
The approach is backed by theoretical examination and extensive practical confirmation. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The presentation could use improvements to make it easier for those not, with the HA or fMRI analysis fields to understand. 
The exploration of constraints and wider relevance is restricted which raises uncertainties regarding the strength and universality of DHA. 
Suggestion; 
In terms this document adds valuable scientific insight, to the area of functional alignment and multi subject fMRI analysis.The delivery may need enhancement; however the rigorous technical aspects and practical results validate its approval.I suggest accepting it with changes to enhance understanding and tackle the noted shortcomings.
