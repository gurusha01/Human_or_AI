This research introduces a type of recurrent neural network structure known as Predictive RNN (PredRNN) which is designed for learning spatiotemporal predictions in a unique way.There is a focus on capturing both patterns and temporal changes by creating a shared memory pool that allows memory to move back and forth through the network.The authors also present an unit called Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST LSTM) which facilitates the simultaneous processing of traditional temporal memory, alongside the new spatiotemporal memory aspect. The model excels in performance, on three video prediction datasets comprising both artificial and real life video sequences. 
The article is nicely written with an explanation of the proposed structure and its parts by the authors.The experiments are detailed. Show great results that highlight PredRNNs effectiveness, in capturing spatial deformations and temporal changes.The authors also compare their model extensively with cutting edge approaches stressing the benefits of their method. 
The papers strong points are; 
A new and innovative design, for predicting patterns.
A novel ST LSTM unit has been introduced to allow for the consideration of both spatial and temporal information.
Following testing and comparison, with other cutting edge models. 
The writing style is concise and easy to follow.  
The papers drawbacks consist of; 
The intricacy of the suggested design could pose difficulties, in its execution and training.
The model doesn't provide an examination of how much computation and memory are needed. 
The models generalizability may be restricted due to the testing, on various datasets and tasks.
Reasons supporting approval; 
The research article introduces an efficient design, for spatial temporal predictive learning.
The findings showcase the performance of the model across three video prediction datasets.
The article is nicely crafted with a description of the suggested framework and its elements.
Reasons opposing approval; 
The intricacy of the suggested structure could pose difficulties, in its execution and training.
The models practical use may be restricted due, to the absence of an examination of its computational expenses and memory needs.
The models overall applicability may be constrained by its evaluation, across various datasets and tasks. 
In general I suggest approving the paper since it introduces an efficient structure for predicting spatiotemporal events and shows its exceptional performance on three video prediction datasets.The authors should however look into the drawbacks of the paper such as the nature of the proposed design and the limited testing of the model, on various datasets and tasks.
