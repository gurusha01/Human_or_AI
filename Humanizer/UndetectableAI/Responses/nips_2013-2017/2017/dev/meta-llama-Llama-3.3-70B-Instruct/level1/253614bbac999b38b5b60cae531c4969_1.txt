In this article a new method is introduced for handling the repeated gathering of counter data with differential privacy (LDP) an important issue in telemetry applications. The authors suggest a strategy that merges 1 bit LDP techniques, with memoization and output perturbation to offer privacy assurances even over extended periods of data collection. 
The paper discusses research on Local Differential Privacy (LDP) focusing on data collection in a single round setting. The authors expand on established methods from studies, by Duchi et al [7, 9 9 ]. Bassily and Smith [3] adjusting them to suit rounds of data collection. The idea of utilizing memoization and output perturbation is influenced by the research from [12]. However the authors have innovatively introduced a method called α point rounding to tackle the privacy leakage problem arising from alterations, in user behavior. 
The paper has strong points, such, as; 
A new approach has been suggested for gathering counter data, in telemetry applications to tackle a major issue. 
The incorporation of α point rounding introduces a method that ensures privacy protection with minimal impact, on accuracy levels. 
The assurance of privacy assurances such, as Theorems 3 and 4 showcases how well the suggested methods work. 
The practical assessment of the suggested methods indicates that they are as good as or even better than the cutting edge methods, for gathering data in a single round. 
The paper has some shortcomings, such, as; 
The idea that user behavior stays roughly the same or changes gradually might not always hold true in real life situations. 
The susceptibility of the suggested methods to being targeted by details, in the manner described in Section 3 point 3 point 101. 
Balancing privacy and accuracy requires adjusting parameters like the granularity of discretization s. The probability of output perturbation 'γ', with care. 
Reasons, in favor of acceptance; 
The research paper offers an addition to the domain of LDP by tackling an important issue, in telemetry applications. 
The suggested methods are well founded in theory. Have been tested in real world scenarios to show their efficacy. 
The document offers an structured overview of the concepts presented in a way that is straightforward to grasp and comprehend. 
Arguments supporting acceptance; 
The expectations regarding user actions may not consistently align with real world scenarios. Could constrain the effectiveness of the suggested methods. 
Concerns may arise in situations regarding the vulnerability to attacks that stem from auxiliary information. 
In real world scenarios tuning parameters may call for extra skills and resources. 
In terms the document offers a nicely crafted and important addition to the domain of LDP (Local Differential Privacy) with the suggested methods showing promise for broad usage in telemetry scenarios. Nevertheless it is crucial to examine the assumptions and drawbacks of this approach, within particular practical situations.
