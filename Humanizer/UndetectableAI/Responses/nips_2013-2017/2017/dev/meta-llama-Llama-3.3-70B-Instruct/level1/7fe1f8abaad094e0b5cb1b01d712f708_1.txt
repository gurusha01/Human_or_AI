This research paper unveils an approach to tackle subgames in imperfect information games that offers solid theoretical assurances and improved practical effectiveness compared to existing methods mentioned before by the authors like Unsafe subgame solving and Maxmargin subgame solving among others They introduce Reach subgame solving as their innovative technique which takes into account the potential actions and incentives of the opponent, in various subgames resulting in enhanced exploitability. 
The paper is nicely. The authors offer a detailed explanation of the ideas and methods discussed in it.The section on notation and background is extensive. Helps in understanding the rest of the paper easily.The experimental section provides an assessment of the techniques proposed along with a comparison, to previous approaches and an examination of the outcomes. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
A new method, for solving subgames has been introduced, showing improved assurances and enhanced real world effectiveness..
An in depth examination of methods for solving subgames is conducted to establish a comprehensive insight into the background and rationale, behind the novel approach. 
An in depth assessment of the suggested methods through trials across different games and assessments, against previous approaches. 
The paper has some drawbacks, such, as; 
The document seems to expect readers to have an understanding of game theory and games with imperfect information in order to fully grasp its content; this could potentially pose difficulties, for those not well versed in these subjects. 
Some parts of the text can be tricky to grasp at glance—especially the notation and background segments—which might need a couple of read throughs to sink in completely. 
The document would be more effective with visual aids, like diagrams or figures to clarify the ideas and methods presented. 
The paper is nicely written with an thorough presentation of the authors research findings.The suggested method shows promise in enhancing the standards for games with imperfect information as highlighted by the practical demonstrations, in the experiments. 
Here are some reasons to consider accepting the proposal; 
The article presents an approach, to solving subgames that offers improved theoretical assurances and practical effectiveness. 
The writers offer an examination of past methods, for solving subgames which helps in grasping the background and reasons behind the introduction of the new approach. 
The experiments show how well the suggested method works in real world situations. 
Reasons, in favor of agreement; 
The paper presumes that readers have an understanding of game theory and games involving imperfect information; this might make it less accessible to those who are not experts, in the field. 
Some parts of the text might be a bit hard to grasp so you might need to read them a times to get the full picture. 
The document would be improved with visual aids to better explain the ideas and methods. 
In my opinion it would be an idea to approve the paper because it brings valuable insights to the realm of games with imperfect information and could advance the current standards in this area of study.However I think it might be beneficial if the authors could make some adjustments to make the paper easier for those not, with the subject and include more visual examples to clarify the ideas and methods presented.
