This research suggests a method to include linear operator restrictions in Gaussian processes (GPs) for problems involving multivariate regression.. The writers present a change, to the covariance function to guarantee that the restrictions are met by every sample taken or prediction made.. The approach involves altering the target function using an operator to accommodate restrictions smoothly..
The article is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue and their method by the authors.The technical parts are elaborate and well organized making it simple to track the authorsreasoning.The test findings show the efficiency of the suggested approach, in both real world scenarios. 
The papers notable features comprise; 
A new and sophisticated method has been suggested for integrating operator constraints into Gaussian Processes (GPs).
A practical method, for creating the conversion tool has been established. 
Showing how well the method works through examples and even a real world experiment demonstration. 
The writing style is clear and concise which makes the paper easy to understand. 
The paper has drawbacks.
The idea that the target function can be described based on a potential function g may not always hold true. 
The use of an approach to create the transformation operator G(x) may not be the most effective or dependable method. 
The absence of an examination of the specifications, for G x might result in a simpler construction process. 
Here are some reasons to consider accepting the proposal; 
The research article suggests an efficient method, for integrating linear operator restrictions into Gaussian Processes (GPs).
The technique has proven effective in a range of scenarios. Has shown success, in a practical experiment using real data. 
The article is nicely written with an concise introduction, by the authors discussing the issue and their method of approach. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The idea that the target function can be represented by a potential function g may not hold true in all cases. 
Building G_x using an approach may not be the most effective or reliable method available. 
Insufficiently examining the demands on G(x) could potentially restrict the effectiveness of the approach. 
In my opinion the paper adds insights to the Gaussian processes and multivariate regression field and I support its acceptance.. I recommend that the authors work on the weaknesses highlighted earlier especially regarding their assumptions about the target function and their dependence, on a specific approach in order to enhance the paper further.
