This research paper introduces a method for organizing spikes on dense multi electrode arrays (MEAs) a vital process in extracting neural signals from extensive electrophysiological datasets.The new method referred as Another Spike Sorter (YASS) employs a step, by step strategy involving efficient detection techniques and clustering algorithms followed by deconvolution methods aimed at enhancing the precision,reliability and scalability of spike sorting operations. 
The research paper discusses past studies in this area. Compares YASS with other methods like KiloSort and Spyking Circus to show that YASS performs better in terms of precision and reliability on both simulated and actual data sets. Additionally the authors analyze the effectiveness of YASS demonstrating a significant increase in speed, for template and cluster estimation compared to its closest rival, Kilosort.
