This study introduces a method for actively conducting sequential hypothesis testing when there is limited understanding of the distribution of outcomes involved in the process.The researchers suggest a strategy known as Incomplete Bayesian Adaptive Gradient (IBAG) which merges a Bayesian updating approach with an Adaptive Gradient selection rule.The effectiveness of the IBAG approach is demonstrated to be on par with established algorithms, like Chernoffs method. Often surpasses them in various scenarios. 
The paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue at hand and their contributions followed by well presented technical sections that include proofs of the theorems, in the supplementary material. 
The papers positive aspects are as follows; 
The writers address an significant issue that holds relevance for various practical uses, like medical assessments and customer service centers. 
The IBAG policy suggestion is straightforward and practical to put into action without the need, for understanding of the outcome distributions. 
The writers conduct an examination of the IBAG policy that covers a minimum sample size and a maximum number of samples needed for accuracy. 
The data clearly shows how well the IBAG approach works in situations when compared to other methods available. 
The papers drawbacks are as follows; 
The document operates under the assumption that the main sets of actions are definitively known; however this may not align with real world scenarios. 
The writers did not thoroughly examine the balance between prudence and expenses in their study; however they do acknowledge it as an avenue, for future research. 
The paper would be more effective with conversations regarding the practical uses and impacts of the IBAG policy, in real life situations. 
Points favoring acceptance; 
The article introduces an significant addition, to the realm of active sequential hypothesis testing. 
The IBAG policy under consideration shows promise in being competitive with algorithms and has the potential, for wide ranging applicability. 
The writers conduct an examination of the IBAG policy that encompasses theoretical limits and practical outcomes. 
Reasons, in favor of acceptance; 
The paper suggests that when the main actions are definitively established in advance it could potentially restrict how broadly the findings can be applied. 
The writers did not thoroughly examine the balance between being cautious and the associated costs, in their work. A factor that holds significance in applications. 
The paper would be improved by including conversations, about how the IBAG policy could be applied in real life situations and the resulting impacts. 
In my opinion it would be an idea to approve the paper since it brings something new and significant to the area of active sequential hypothesis testing with the IBAG policy showing promise for widespread use. Yet it would be beneficial if the writers could delve deeper into shortcomings like exploring the balance, between caution and cost further and talking about how the IBAG policy could be applied and its real world effects discussed in more detail.
