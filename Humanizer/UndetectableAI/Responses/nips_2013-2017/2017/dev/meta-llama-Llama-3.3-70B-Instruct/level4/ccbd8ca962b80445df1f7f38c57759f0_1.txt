This study introduces a streamlined version of the "Linear Fascicle Evaluation model," (LiFE) aimed at overcoming its limitations in handling complex MRI data efficiently at full resolution due to computational constraints. The researchers suggest a simplified approach using a Tucker model that maintains accuracy while significantly reducing data size based on both theoretical backing and practical tests.The proposed model and analysis seem reliable overall.However I am particularly interested in the attention given to evaluating the effectiveness of the model, for tractography.It is briefly touched upon. Could benefit from further exploration. Given the space available, for a NIPS papers content restrictions are reasonable. 
The article is nicely. The visuals make it easy to understand for the readers.I'm not familiar, with tractography and tensor models. I still found the paper interesting to go through.  
Some slight remarks are as follows;  
The suggestion that the varied outcomes of approaches drive the need for convex models appears questionable since these variations are probably due to diverse modeling assumptions rather, than achieving a universal best solution. 
The authors should be praised for their attempt to clarify their ideas in terms as it greatly improves the readability of the paper. 
There might be a mistake in the sentence that mentions "...dataset Fig 4.a " which could mean that the reference to the figure should be, in parentheses instead. 
"There is a spelling error ('aproach' instead of 'approach'), on line 202."
Based on the additional assessments I have reviewed thoroughly beforehand I stand by my judgment that this paper deserves to be accepted.
