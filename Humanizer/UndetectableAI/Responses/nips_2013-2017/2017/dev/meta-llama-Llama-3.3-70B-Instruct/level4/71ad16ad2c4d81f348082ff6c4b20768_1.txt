UPDATE. Appreciate your reply being acknowledged and reviewed. 
This document delves into a subject – the integration of symmetries or invariances into kernels with a key emphasis, on Bayesian nonparametric regression methods. In this scenario limitations can be set as information although the shape of the regression function stays undefined. An interesting instance of such a limitation emerges when the simulated field is identified as divergence type ensuring the preservation of a physical quantity. In the studies in this field have focused on creating ANOVA kernels and Steins method based kernels that must have vanishing integrals as a constraint in their design process. This new study sets itself apart by aiming to incorporate types of constraints compared to previous works. This is a move considering how widely generic kernels are used in machine learning applications without clear physical reasoning, behind their selection. 
While I have reservations about the proposed approach due to its scope and lack of a solid theoretical foundation to ensure its efficacy, across all scenarios​​​​​I find it to be a valuable addition that could be appropriately featured in the NIPS conference materials. 
I've made an observations for potential enhancements.
The authors need to connect their research to the body of literature by referencing the study "Learning through Algebraic Invariances and the Invariant Kernel Trick " authored by Franz J Király et al. 
The statement on page 4 suggesting that the prior for f "inherits" characteristics from the prior for g is inaccurate. If g has a GP(0,k) where k creates a Sobolex space of degree b and \mathcal{ F } represents a differential operator of degree c then the prior for f would be linked to a Sobolex space of degree b. C. This implies varying levels of smoothness, for f and g. 
On page 5 of the document is an equation "fi=Φi*xi*f," which seems to be stated as applicable but is actually more of an assumption or proposition than a universal truth, like the equation " g=Γ*ξ*g". It would be helpful to indicate this distinction to prevent any misunderstandings. 
The methods limitations should be clearly acknowledged by providing an example of its failure to offer a grasp of both its strengths and weaknesses.
