This paper shows how certain challenging prediction issues with losses can now be tackled more effectively using new methods.The method is based on two ideas;(1)simplifying the complex optimization problem described in equation (9) reducing the complexity, from exponential to quadratic based on the sample size and(2)application of an enhanced version of the stochastic variance reduction gradient(SVRG),modified for Bregman divergences to solve the simplified optimization problem with additional regularization. 
The main idea of the paper is speeding up the resolution of issues but mainly focusing on simplifying it through the F score loss method raised some questions about its adaptability with other types of losses in mind.The inclusion of SVRG extension, for Bregman divergences seems like an applicable outcome which hints that the manuscript could have focused on presenting Breg SVRGas an alternative instead of solely on adversarial optimization using F score as an example. 
My overall impression of the paper is that it's technically solid and engaging enough to deserve acceptance.
