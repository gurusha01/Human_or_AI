This study introduces a hyperalignment technique that utilizes neural networks instead of basis functions and expands on a structure similar to kernel hyperalignment methodology It has been tested on various real life MRI datasets which showed enhancements, in classification accuracy and decreased computational time when compared to a different deep learning model. 
There are issues to consider regarding the contributions made in the paper.
The authenticity of this work is in doubt since it seems to blend ideas together. Substituting functions, with neural networks could create a tougher optimization challenge and the optimization process appears to be influenced by earlier studies. 
Noteworthy publications regarding alignment, like the ones authored by Georg Lang are not included in the reference list. 
The main aim of alignment is to match subjects for modeling subject variations accurately. However using a classification task to assess the approach complicates determining if enhanced classification accuracy results from alignment or a more efficient functional representation. Additionally it's uncertain how to link the aligned data to the anatomical space, for interpretation purposes. 
The lack of uniqueness in G could have an influence on the outcomes and therefore requires more, in depth exploration. 
The results that have been shared might not be completely accurate because of the possibility of overfitting; they showcase the performance levels, over various parameter values instead of being derived from thorough nested cross validation processes. Choosing parameter ranges carefully is crucial as it can greatly impact the results. More adaptable models show better performance overall. 
Determining whether the performance improvement seen with hyperalignment remains consistent without spatial normalization is crucial since pre anatomical alignment isn't believed to be necessary for this process to occur.
