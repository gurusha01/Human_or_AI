This document delves into the topic of managing convex optimization with changing constraints over time to reduce regret while keeping a consistent limit on violating stochastic constraints in a controlled manner. The authors address this issue in scenarios with fixed and random variables. Establish optimal limits of $\sqrt{T}\log T $ for regret and constraint breach under reasonable circumstances. An enhancement from the current constraint violation limit of $ T^{3 / 4}$. Initial tests on a job scheduler, back up their theoretical discoveries. 
The issue at hand is quite interesting. Compellingly argued for despite having been investigated in different ways before now. Nonetheless this study showcases progress beyond the current limits when it comes to regret and adherence to constraints. The paper is presented in a manner overall and the contributions are placed in the context of existing literature with a thorough examination of relevant research. The writing style is decent, with an organized storyline and suitable language choices. From a perspective the paper seems solid with the proofs appearing accurate after some initial checks, for sanity but a more detailed review of the appendix is needed during the rebuttal phase. 
In short this study presents a viewpoint on online linear optimization with constraints that requires a unique analytical method. Though the feedback system could use encouragement the fundamental concept of examining prolonged constraint breaches as a substitute for expensive projections in online education is quite intriguing and well supported offering a significant addition, to the field.
