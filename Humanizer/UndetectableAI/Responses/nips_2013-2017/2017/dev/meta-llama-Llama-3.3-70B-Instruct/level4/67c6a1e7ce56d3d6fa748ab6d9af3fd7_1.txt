This paper suggests a method that focuses on detecting actions and interactions between humans and objects using attention mechanisms that can function with or without guidance.The system delivers precision without significantly enlarging the network size or computational intricacy.The researchers extensively analyze the attention module through analytical means and present bottom up and top down attention, as simplified versions of bilinear pooling techniques commonly employed in detailed classification tasks.The effectiveness of this approach is confirmed through experiments conducted on three datasets. 
One significant advantage of this task is the capacity to grasp attention maps without guidance in a way that offers understanding about the areas for the network concerning both inherent salience and directed focus from above biastrackers performance without the necessity, for identifying boundary boxes usually essential in rigorous focus mechanisms. 
The study shared is interesting. The main concept seems to be well thought out. The research paper is also nicely written. However there is an issue regarding how the fully connected weight matrix is approximated in second order pooling by using the product of two rank one vectors. It's important to explore any loss of information that may occur compared to the matrix and determine if this loss affects the attention map. Additional theoretical examination and conversation, about this matter are needed. 
Furthermore e identified a small problems. 
There is a verb agreement error, in the phrase "network architecture that incorporates this attention module and explores a pose..." on page 3. 
On page 5 it mentions that "it comprises a series of modules " which also needs to be corrected for subjectâ€“verb agreement. 
Finally in section 8 of the document,"...the image was resized to 450 pixels during input time" there is a phrase that's unclear and could use some improvement, for better comprehension.
