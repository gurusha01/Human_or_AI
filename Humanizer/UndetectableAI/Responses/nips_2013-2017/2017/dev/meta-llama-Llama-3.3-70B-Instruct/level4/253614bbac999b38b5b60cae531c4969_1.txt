Sorry,. I can't do that. If you provide me with the text you want me to paraphrase I can certainly assist you with that.
The writers claim that their 1 bit method for estimating means is designed to enhance communication efficiency; however it's not clear how this method is distinct, from the randomizer outlined in [reference 2]. In situations where the suggested procedure performs similarly to the randomizer from [reference 2] it is important to explicitly recognize this similarity. 
Theory 2
Comparative analysis of the usefulness in relation, to both the variables and d when compared to current histogram methods would offer valuable perspectives on the efficiency of the suggested method. 
Section 3 point 10
The privacy assurances connected to alpha point rounding are somewhat unclear at this point in time. Need further definition, for full clarity. In situations where a person collecting data submits their information repeatedly (for example N times) it is important to calculate the privacy allowance based upon the composition theorem. Although alpha point rounding adds another element of randomness that could improve privacy measures the composition theorem still applies when multiple responses are shared with the person collecting the information highlighting the importance of managing the overall privacy budget in such scenarios.
