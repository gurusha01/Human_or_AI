This research paper combines methods for optimizing large scale systems such as smoothing techniques like acceleration and homotopy along, with non uniform sampling methods. It tackles an optimization challenge that deals with three functions and a linear operator presented as f(x)+g(x)+h(A*x) where f is considered smooth. To address the term h(A*x) the authors utilize a smoothing method introduced by Nesterov in their approach. Following that process involves selecting and updating blocks in succession using a forward backward splitting technique.The integration of acceleration and homotopy aids in the creation of an algorithm that converges quickly.Moreover this method employs an algorithm that utilizes the proximal gradient approach, for the smoothed function.   
The numerical tests show how well the new algorithm works when compared to other methods available.
