This study presents a Bayesian network designed to improve the accuracy of iBCi decoders by minimizing mistakes utilizing a more extensive neural signal history, for enhanced performance. 
The latest advancements seem to rely on employing Kalman filters to decode signals, for detecting movement angles successfully implemented by the researchers signify progress through the integration of an enhanced tuning curve and a revised Kalman filter system. 
Could you please explain the recording time needed to kickstart both the tuning curve and the decoder?
The authors discuss how they go beyond the Kalman filters focus on encoding the desired cursor movement vector by incorporating the final two dimensional location on the screen where the participant intends to move the cursor as part of their decoders state. Does this mean that knowing the goal position in advance is necessary for this approach to work effectively, as a method? If so shouldn't they explicitly mention this limitation in their explanation?
