The paper presents a method called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM) which uses a multiplicative update strategy to tackle the broad Quadratic Programming issue efficiently and effectively compared to traditional techniques by offering closed form solutions in its update steps that guarantee convergence while smoothly integrating doubly stochastic restrictions, in the optimization process. 
The project shows technical foundations as its assertions are backed by solid theoretical and experimental evidence. 
The written document is nicely crafted with expression and a well laid out structure. 
While I don't have a grasp of graph matching and its related research materials in depth the suggested approach seems to be quite original upon review. Considering the details provided and the outcomes presented both qualitatively and quantitatively the enhancement, over the existing cutting edge technology seems satisfactory. 
Graph matching is a recognized issue in the field, with an algorithm that ensures reliable results being a noteworthy advancement.
