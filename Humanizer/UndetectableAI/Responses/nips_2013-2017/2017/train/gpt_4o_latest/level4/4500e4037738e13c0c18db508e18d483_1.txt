The paper presents two algorithms designed to fix mistakes in the shapes of sections within electron images, for reconstructi ng neural circuits.The first algorithm detects errors while the second one fixes them.These algorithms are used together in a manner to gradually improve an initial segmentation. 
 Input; Contribution 
The initial neural network (referred to as the detector) assesses if the area, around the pixel of a designated region needs adjustment while the second neural network (known as the corrector) anticipates the accurate form of the area encompassing the central pixel. 
Based on what I know far about this topic and considering the corrections made at each pixel along with a segmentation measure like VI can lead to a collective issue, for the whole volume to be addressed. The paper doesn't delve into. Acknowledge this potential problem but opts for a different approach. Utilizing a greedy algorithm outlined informally in Section 5 that continually adjusts the segmentation process and seems to rely on a superpixel segmentation method briefly highlighted in the same section. 
I'm not certain about the significance of the findings, for the connectomics field but I have doubts regarding how useful the greedy algorithm might be outside of connectomics. 
In my opinion this paper does not seem to be very relevant, to the NIPS audience. 
 Introduction  
The document is nicely. Easy to understand overall. Although the technical parts (sections 4 and 5, in particular ) seem casual which could make it challenging to completely comprehend how the algorithms are meant to work. 
In the parts and the review sections of a document it's advisable to not emphasize too much on contrasting a challenging problem with an easily verifiable solution as this idea is commonly understood by those in the field of computer science who are familiar, with the NP complexity class definition. I particularly do not agree with the assertion that "identifying errorss a more suitable challenge compared to merging supervoxels together."
In the realm of research. 
The potential links mentioned between the suggested approach and GAN models [references 08 and 09] along with attention [reference 10] seem somewhat uncertain and speculative in nature within this study without strong technical support provided in the text itself. If the writers intend to refer to these connections they should consider doing briefly in a concluding section, towards the end of their research paper.
