This study presents a covariance function for multi output Gaussian processes in the spectral domain perspective—a unique approach that adds valuable insights, to Gaussian processes and deserves more acknowledgment in my view.This research expands on the domain technique to address multi output scenarios. The paper expands upon the research introduced in [1] by tackling the issue of determining cross covariances in scenarios with multiple outputs that may not always be positive definite. The authors introduce a solution to overcome this obstacle by introducing the mixture covariance function for multi output Gaussian processes. 
The paper is nicely. Provides a clear and to the point introduction to the issue and the basics of Gaussian processes.The explanation of the mixture kernel is easy to understand and the new additions seem innovative from what I know.The links, to research are well explained and I think the paper shows enough creativity to deserve being published. 
The testing conducted in this study meets the requirements for a paper like this one; however it lacks some insight into the Jura dataset which can be a bit challenging to understand at glance.However I believe that the results from the experiments are satisfactory, for the context of this research. 
Wilson and Adams (2013) presented a study on Gaussian process kernels for identifying patterns and making predictions at the International Conference on Machine Learning, in Atlanta in June 2013 (pp 1067–1075). This research was published by JMLR.org.
