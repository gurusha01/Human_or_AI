Overall Assessment; 
I generally think the suggested approach is convincing and impactful based off of the results and attention maps indicating that the enhancements are due to improved attention mechanisms rather than just a bigger model capacity increase in effect. However I did find the wording a bit unclear and, at times confusing. If the authors put in work I think they could revise the paper effectively to tackle these concerns. 
Advantages; 
The new model is cutting edge. Yields impressive outcomes.   
The report contains qualitative and quantitative studies.   
I found the shift, from focusing on one or two aspects to the attention mechanism really intriguing! However I was hoping to come across some attention maps in the main text or supplementary materials. Did I miss them somewhere?   
Areas of improvement; 
The way the writing is structured and presented can sometimes feel a bit disorganized as mentioned before.   
The originality of the work seems a bit restricted in scope.When comparing the architecture to the MCB, for VQA model [5] it is clear that it is more advanced and performs better; however the additional complexity primarily stems from expanding on the concepts introduced in [5]. At higher (trinary levels and lower (unary levels). While this may not be a concern I suggest that the authors provide a clearer explanation of their contributions (including any that I may have overlooked).  
The link based on probability seems underdeveloped. Lacks a formal structure to be regarded as more than just a guiding concept at this point in time. It's okay for now; however I recommend that the authors either refine this connection, with precision or adjust the wording to accurately convey its significance.   
Figure 2 finds a tricky balance between being detailed and not abstract enough to explain the networks workings effectively What is needed is a clearer focus, on illustrating the creation of unary pairwise and trinary potentials   
I didn't see any reference, to Figure 3 in the text â€“ unless I overlooked it.   
Areas of interest; 
What were the specific values obtained for the coefficients that were applied to blend the marginalized potentials, in Equation (2)? It would be interesting to explore if various modalities utilized potential sequences.   
It caught my attention that the 2 modalities Unary + Pairwise model doesn't perform well as MCB [7] even though they have similar structures. I was quite surprised that this finding wasn't thoroughly examined and explained by the authors. Do you think the authors have any insights into this result? Could it have to do with the transition from MCB, to MCT decision computation modules?   
The debate over whether to use sequential MCB layers or a single MTC layer for the decision making aspect was intriguing; however there seems to be a lack of accompanying results in this regard, from the authors.
