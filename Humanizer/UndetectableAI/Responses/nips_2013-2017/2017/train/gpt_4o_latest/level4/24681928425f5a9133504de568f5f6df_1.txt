This study delves into how user questions can be replicated in a Battleship game but of asking about specific squares on the board it focuses on inquiries expressed using an artificial language with logical semantics inspired by Montagues work.The method relies on a log model that considers four simple aspects of the questions such, as the anticipated information gain or informativeness the type of answer required (Boolean or numerical) and whether the question relates to board features. 
The underlying rationale within the realm of learning seems sound at a broad level; however the concepts outlined in this piece are quite basic in nature. Moreover the assignment itself appears simplistic and narrowly defined making it devoid of logical ambiguity. Consequently I doubt that this paper would capture interest, within the NIPS community.
