The study explores how changing the transaction flooding process in the Bitcoin network can help prevent deanonymization attacks that were seen in the protocol before 2015.The researchers created models, for both the original protocol (trickle) and the updated version (diffusion). They found that deanonymization could be successfully carried out under both protocols with results as shown in simulations using these models. 
How well the information was presented; 
The article is organized nicely and written well overall; however it does have some small problems, like unfinished sentences and a reference that is not fully addressed yet It gives background details for readers to grasp the context and technical aspects effectively.  
The explanation of the transaction flooding protocols is detailed. The models underlying assumptions are clearly explained. 
Questions regarding the content; 
The writers mention a 30 percent chance of identifying participants which is considered low yet meaningful nonetheless. However they suggest a point for revealing identities is that the listening supernode needs to connect with every active Bitcoin node. Considering the expected expansion of the network How likely is it that this assumption will hold up in the coming years?  Update; The authors make an argument about using botnets as a strong response, to this issue. 
Despite the analysis in the papers content it fails to completely tackle the main argument that trickle and diffusion protocols maintain anonymity equally well. For example Figure 6 demonstrates a difference of around 0. 1 In detection probability between the two protocols in simulations, with diffusion performing effectively than trickle. A notable discrepancy. On the hand Figure 7 highlights a contrasting observation ; in a real network snapshot study diffusion surpasses trickle.(It's interesting to mention that the chances become equal when more eavesdropper connections are involved.) These different findings call for exploration and there is a need, for a clearer explanation regarding the claim that the two protocols have "comparable detection probabilities." In particular,<br>how is the term "comparable" being interpreted and evaluated in this scenario?
