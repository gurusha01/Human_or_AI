This paper is really well written. Provides a cohesive view on advanced techniques for density modeling in the field of data science and AI research. Specifically highlighted are autoregressive models and various flows like normalizing flows and inverse autoregressive flows alongside Real NVP and NICE which are discussed within a framework. Though some aspects of this viewpoint have been explored before as seen in the IAF paper by Kingma et al. this study offers a detailed and easily understandable explanation of the relationships, between these models and methodologies. Furthermore using this all encompassing viewpoint the writers suggest an innovative version and showcase very encouraging outcomes that match or even exceed cutting edge techniques.
