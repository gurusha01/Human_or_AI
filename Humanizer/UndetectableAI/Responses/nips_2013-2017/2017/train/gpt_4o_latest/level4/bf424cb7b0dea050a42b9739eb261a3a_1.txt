The study explores how eigenvalue decay influences the accuracy of approximating functions, with Gradient Descent (GD). It emphasizes that using GD with differentiable kernels to estimate non smooth functions may require a significant amount of iterations for convergence to occur efficiently.It suggests two solutions to tackle this challenge. Incorporating second order techniques or implementing regularization.However the use of regularization may introduce bias whereas second order methods can be computationally demanding.To address these drawbacks the study introduces a strategy known as Eigen Pro. 
The discovery that Gaussian processes encounter challenges when trying to approximate smooth functions using kernels that have an infinite differentiability is truly interesting and thought provoking.The correlation made between this constraint and the decreasing eigenvalues of kernel functions is especially remarkable.The implementation of Eigen Pro introduces an approach that utilizes implicit regularization via randomization.It provides an computationally effective option, with possible real world uses. 
Although the strengths mentioned in the paper are praiseworthy and worth noting there are two weaknesses that require attention. Firstly the implications of the results obtained are somewhat unclear. In terms of speeding up computations the comparisons with PEGASOS show slight enhancements and, at times Eigen Pro is actually slower. While the fact that the suggested approach matches the effectiveness of kernel based algorithms is notable; a more direct comparison is needed to fully grasp the balance between time and precision differences between them both. For example; showcasing outcomes by training a neural network (often seen as a cutting edge standard) and contrasting its efficiency with the kernel approximation, in a simulated environment could be beneficial. Having an understanding of the balance between time and accuracy would offer more clarity, in making decisions. 
The extended edition of the document is clear and user friendly for readers to grasp easily; however the submitted version lacks readability and could be enhanced by improving clarity and structure. 
Overall this paper makes contributions but lacks clarity in explaining the experimental findings and ensuring readability.
