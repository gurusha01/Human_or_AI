The main focus of this article is to present a framework for parallel machine learning techniques that aims to enhance the way base learners are combined beyond simple averaging methods by replacing subsets of hypotheses with their Radon points instead. The authors have set complexity boundaries for their method. Conducted practical comparisons with parallel algorithms in Spark and base linear models, in Weka to demonstrate its effectiveness. 
The paper presents an idea by suggesting a method that combines weak learners in a black box manner as an alternative to using bagging with weak learners. On the side of things discussed in the paper is the analysis of the complexity of the Radon machine which shows that by partitioning original samples into subsets for a parallel machine model results, in much better efficiency when compared to a base learner working on the entire dataset. Furthermore the authors also introduce a PAC bound for the Radon machine. The paper makes theoretical contributions but raises doubts about how practical the method is for high dimensional datasets in real world use cases. There are uncertainties, about how the proposed approach would perform in such complex scenarios since the experiments were limited to small datasets with only 18 features. This might not accurately represent the difficulties faced in machine learning applications across various fields. If the authors could explore how their approach could be expanded to manage data, with high dimensions in a more robust manner it would greatly enhance the papers quality.
