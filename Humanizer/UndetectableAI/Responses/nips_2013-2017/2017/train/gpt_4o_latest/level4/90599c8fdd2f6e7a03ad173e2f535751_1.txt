The research paper introduces two versions of SMDP UCRL (known as SUCRL) called FSUCRL version 1 and FSUCRL version 2 and evaluates how well they perform in terms of regret analysis. The main difference lies in the fact that the proposed variants do not assume knowledge of specific parameters related to option behavior like SUCRL does; instead they directly estimate these parameters based on the available data. These two versions take approaches. One calculates the parameters and their confidence intervals explicitly while the other uses a "nested" method to indirectly determine the parameters. The performance limits reached by the suggested approaches are similar in effectiveness as those of SUCRL with the exception of an expense linked with parameter estimation efforts mentioned in the document along with some real world data provided as evidence, for the theoretical conclusions. 
The paper is nicely written overall with a few sections due to its technical content nature.The main idea of the study is applying the Markov chain representation to an option.The suggestion is to provide some insight into the proof of Theorem 1 within the text for better understanding as currently the entire proof is only, in the appendix.
