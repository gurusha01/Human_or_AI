The article presents an approach to variational inference that is designed specifically for conducting likelihood free inference tasks. This technique expands on research, in the field and draws inspiration from Hierarchical Variational Inference and Implicit Variational Bayes methodologies. 
The key innovation of the paper is in taking the log of the actual distribution and redefining the ELBO as shown in Equation 4.This new approach emphasizes the possibility of utilizing log density ratio estimation for likelihood free variational inference.The other methodological aspects draw upon techniques such, as log density ratio estimation,reparameterization and hierarchical variational distributions. 
While I was intrigued by the suggested method for dealing with the complexity of probability estimation in situations it relies heavily on accurately estimating the ratio of logarithms of densities in spaces with many dimensions (specifically, in the combined space of observed data xn and hidden variables zn). This presents difficulties because estimating log density ratios in high dimensional settings is known to be quite challenging and the authors fail to present convincing proof of a reliable algorithm to address this concern. For instance. The use of this approach on a traditional Bayesian GAN for classifying tasks instead of a typical GAN that handles complex data like images hints at potential instability, in the current algorithms design and implementation (referencing page 7). It is challenging to foresee how this new algorithm could achieve stability since the "variational joint distribution may significantly deviate from the joint distribution during the initial optimization phases. The inconsistency in log density ratio estimation greatly affects its reliability. Can result in skewed gradients, at the crucial early stages of the optimization process.
