This paper discusses how to represent paths on a map as a likelihood distribution using Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagram (PSDD). It can be tricky to represent structures like maps but the authors simplify this by converting the map into a Boolean circuit for easy analysis and prediction tasks such as forecasting taxi routes, in San Francisco where their method outshines two other methods tested as baselines. 
PSDD frameworks offer a way to express probability distributions for objects using Boolean circuits effectively and efficiently.Once an object is transformed into a circuit it becomes simpler to parameterize.These PSDD structures are defined by establishing distributions for each OR gate and have the ability to model any distribution (with uniqueness in scenarios). The authors concentrate their efforts specifically in learning distributions, for routes. Ones that are connected and acyclic. One major benefit of SDD circuits is that they can process graphs that would be difficult to model using networks due to computational constraints; however PSDDs encounter challenges in dealing with large maps efficiently due, to tractability issues.The writers tackle this problem by utilizing approximations wherein the map is divided into hierarchical sections to maintain polynomial distribution representation as long as each sections size is kept within limits. 
The article is nicely. The authors provide clear and concise explanations of PSDD issue.defines provided by the authors are clear and concise. 
The findings in the document seem like steps forward to me.The writers implement a known framework, for graphs. Use established inference methods after making some simplifications.Additionally the document spends pages discussing theorems that seem like basic algorithmic outcomes. 
To consider the suggested method favorably I'd like to review more tests and comparisons.
