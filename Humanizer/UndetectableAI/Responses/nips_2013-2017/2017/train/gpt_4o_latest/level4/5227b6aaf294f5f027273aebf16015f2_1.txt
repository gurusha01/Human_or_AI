This research paper presents a method that uses an original operator to substitute the traditional convolutional filter operation that usually relies on matrix inner product computation technique. Of evaluating the correlation between filter weights and pixel values (or activation values in middle layers) the new approach calculates the angle between them in the hypersphere space. Additionally the researchers introduce three kinds of operators. Linear, cosine and sigmoid. All determined by this angle. In addition, to this process they also redefine the regularization term and loss function to enhance their technique. A detailed analysis showcases how each element plays a role in enhancing outcomes for classifying images in CIFAR datasets. CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100. And for tasks involving image feature embedding.They have shown enhancements in terms of increased accuracy and quicker convergence, with improved efficiency as well. 
The research paper is solid, in theory. Well organized with coherent experiments that are clearly and elegantly presented. 
However one drawback of the study is the absence of testing on more practical image classification datasets like ImageNet without any mention or hint about addressing this in the future plans and it could also be beneficial to assess the approach, on a wider variety of tasks including small scale reinforcement learning issues.
