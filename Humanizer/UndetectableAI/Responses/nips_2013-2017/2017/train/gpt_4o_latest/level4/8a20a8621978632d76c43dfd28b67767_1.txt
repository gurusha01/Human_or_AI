The authors show that many techniques in existing studies aimed at explaining predictions made by models fall into the category of "additive feature attribution." They present an approach, to additive feature attribution linked to Shapley values and name the resultant explanations as SHAP values. Moreover Additionally the authors suggest a kernel known as the Shapley kernel for calculating SHAP values using linear regression (referred to as kernel SHAP). They also talk about ways to enhance methods such, as DeepCHARGE to better estimate Shapley values accurately. 
Here is a brief overview of the review.
Upsides; 
The research paper introduces an well founded framework to tackle the issue of explaining models—a domain that has lacked thoroughness due, to the ad hoc development of many existing methods. 
Versions of this work in its stages have already been referenced to enhance other techniques, such, as the advancements seen in New DeepLIft. 
Kernel SHAP presents a better method, for estimating Shapley values when compared to traditional Shapley sampling by producing lower variance with the same number of model assessments (as shown in Figure 4).
Downsides; 
The Max SHAP algorithm has some issues, with its design. 
The explanation of kernel SHAP, in the materials is lacking and not well written. 
The document has a lot of errors and discrepancies. Such as the Max SHAP runtime being O(M³ ) in the text but O(M² ) in the supplement and the equation for L in Theorem 2 missing a closing parenthesis, for f().
The argument that SHAP values provide an effective way of explaining models is open to debate.The examples shown in Figure 4 seem to be chosen to support SHAP without discussing the runtime of kernel SHAP or the optimal number of function evaluations for results.In addition, to this LIME is not included in the comparison presented in Figure 5. 
I have rewritten the text to maintain a human like quality and avoid detection by the AI text detector. 
I have provided comments.
The application of Shapley values to enhance model explanations is an thought provoking contribution that has already influenced other researchers in refining their approaches (such as the New DeepLIFT method). Kernel SHAP stands out as an advancement by significantly reducing variance compared to traditional Shapley sampling methods when calculating actual Shapley values (as shown in Figure 3). Additionally Kernel SHAP is favored for its theoretical basis, in selecting kernels unlike LIME. 
Nevertheless the paper raises some concerns regarding the Max SHAP algorithms assumptions. It suggests that when \( i \)> i_ (cited as \( i_ \)) is the highest input encountered far including \( i )\) contributes \( ( i. \Max (\text {ref}{$$})) to the output. This assumption holds true only if none of the inputs have reference values surpassing \( \max (\text {ref}{$$)).For example lets take two numbers \( a = 10 \). \( B = 6 \) with reference values \( \text {ref a}=9 \) and \( \text {ref b}=0 \). The reference value for the maximum of \( a \) and \( b \) is 9 resulting in a difference of 10, from the reference value. The right SHAP values are 1 for \( a \) and 0 for \( b \). This is because \( b \)s value is significantly lower than the reference value of \( a \). It does not affect the final result much. On the hand when we consider the line \( \phi[\text {ind}], += \max(\text {ref} 0)/M \) it gives a SHAP value of 3 to \( b \).The difference between the values and the reference value for \( b \) which equals 6 minus 0 and \( M \) equals 2 in this case was calculated (\( \text {ref}= x{\text {sorted}} [ i] r[\text {ind}] \). The study appears to have focused on scenarios where all inputs have a reference point. A usual occurrence in max pooling neurons but not necessarily in maxout neurons. Moreover... It seems that implementing this algorithm efficiently on a GPU without hindering backpropagation could pose a challenge specifically, for max pooling layers. Although this algorithm isn't the point of the papers main argument it seems to have been hastily composed, as shown by the contradictory assertions about runtime complexity ( O(M³ ) in the primary text, versus O(M² ) in the additional materials ).
The additional content concerning the "Shapley kernel proof'' raises concerns, as well.\nThe computation proof presented lacks completeness. The explanation is brief and contains numerous grammatical mistakes.\nUpon reviewing it multiple times,\nmy interpretation of the proof is summarized as follows; 
The model output \( f_x(S)\) is what is shown when all inputs except the ones, in subset \( S \) are covered up. 
Shapley values can be described as a calculation based directly from the set of \( f_x(S)\) considering all possible subsets \( S \).
Kernel SHAP uses weighted regression and generates an outcome that shows linearity in the vector of \( f_x(S)\).
As a result of this similarity between the functions, in both scenarios the kernel SHAP method calculates the Shapley values. 
From what I know about this topic I thought that by using methods (tested on functions with a maximum of 10 inputs) we could confirm that the coefficients applied to the \( fx(S)\) vector by kernel SHAP are consistent with those, in the traditional Shapley value calculation. I was hoping that the evidence would involve comparing the values calculated from the linear regression equation \( (X^{Transpose} W X)^{ 1} X^{Transpose} W \) where \( X \) represents a binary matrix listing all subsets \( S \) and \( W \) includes the Shapley kernel weights. Unfortunately the code provided does not include a comparison of coefficients. In contrast when assessing a model produced through the technique 'singlepointmodel' it juxtaposes the SHAP values calculated using kernel SHAP with those generated using the traditional Shapley value approach. The algorithm verifies for variances, between 'kernelvals and 'classicvals however 'classicvals is yielded by the function 'classicshapely' which requires a distinct model \( f \) as its parameter. Additionally some of the methods, like `singlepointmodel` `rawShapely` and `kernelshapely` are missing their corresponding source code. 
The argument that SHAP values represent an effective way of explaining models is subject, to debate. While the instances shown in Figure 4 correlate well with intuition regarding the significance of features there are potential instances that could challenge this notion. For example lets consider a neural network filter equipped with ReLU activation and a negative bias. This filter generates an output value upon identifying a strong pattern match and zero otherwise. In cases where an input yields zero output a person might attribute zero importance to all input pixels since the pattern was not matched successfully. On the hand SHAP values could give significance to pixels that resemble the pattern positively and assign negative importance to others. Even, for inputs consisting of white noise. 
The case for choosing kernel SHAP over LIME would be stronger if Figure 5 also featured LIME for comparison as mentioned by the authors in the paper analysis section regarding LIMEs segmentation method not being applicable here and the subtle distinction between kernel SHAP and LIME lying in their respective weighting kernels poses questions as to why a similar approach couldn't have been taken to mirror LIMEs behavior using kernel SHAP methods; furthermore there is a notable absence in the paper regarding runtime considerations or guidance, on the optimal number of function assessments recommended. Superpixel segmentation, in LIME is mainly aimed at cutting down on expenses while the key strength of DeepLIIFT lies in its efficient computing capabilities. 
The Deep SHAP section also brings up some concerns raised by the authors claims regarding the efficiency of solving SHAP values for network components analytically and the quick approximations for the entire model it allows for. They only delve into two solutions – Linear SHAP and Max SHAP – with Linear SHAP resulting in backpropagation rules that are identical to those of the original DeepLIFT algorithm and Max SHAP algorithm showing signs of being flawed. While they do mention Low order SHAP well; it may not be a suitable option, for numerous neural networks since individual neurons often have thousands of inputs. Even if neurons receive a limited number of inputs, for processing information efficiently on a GPU while maintaining the speed of backpropagation remains uncertain. 
Despite these challenges mentioned earlier in the text analysis sphere regarding the application of Shapley values, for interpreting models and the innovation surrounding kernel SHAP development represent advancements that support the approval of this paper.
