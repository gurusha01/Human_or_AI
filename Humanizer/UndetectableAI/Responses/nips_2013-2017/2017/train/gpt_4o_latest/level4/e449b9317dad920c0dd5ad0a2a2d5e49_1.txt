This article presents a statistical method created for examining calcium imaging information by capturing both the temporal patterns and spatial characteristics of cells.This has an impact on neuroscience research since improvements in managing interference could greatly benefit the field.The suggested approach seems to have similarities, with the CNMF technique but includes a loss function.I may not be fully qualified to assess how unique or valid the statistical framework is; however I will concentrate on discussing its real world use cases. 
I'm most interested in Fig 2d because it appears that the accuracy of the estimation worsens with each iteration in that figure. The reason for this could be that the authors started the algorithm with the cell locations as a reference point. A situation that isn't very realistic and lacks sufficient explanation in the paper. This makes it difficult to verify the assertion that the EXTRACT algorithm's superior, to CNMF (or ICA).
Additional remarks; 
The absence of values in calcium imaging data does not result from their source in photons but rather arises from the natural control of calcium in neurons; where initial free calcium levels are close, to zero and surge significantly when voltage gated ion channels open up. 
How about using a Poisson distribution to create simulated data for representing photon shot noise in fluorescence imaging data, for an authentic noise model?
