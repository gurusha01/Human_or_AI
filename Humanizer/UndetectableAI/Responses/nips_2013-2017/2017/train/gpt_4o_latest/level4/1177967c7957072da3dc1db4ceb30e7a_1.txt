The authors have presented an adaptive importance sampling technique specifically designed for coordinate descent and stochastic gradient methods in their work. By utilizing upper bounds on gradient values and suggesting an effective approximation for gradient based sampling based on them. The method has been rigorously demonstrated to be superior, within these boundaries compared to uniform or fixed importance sampling methods. Can be easily integrated with minimal computational burden. Though there have been explorations of adaptive importance sampling strategies the authors introduce a new approach that frames selecting the best sampling distribution as a convex optimization challenge and provides an effective algorithm to address it. 
This article is excellently. Makes a meaningful addition, to the study of importance sampling methods. 
Sorry I can't do that. My purpose is to explain the process so you understand how I work. Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance, with anything else.  
Proof of Lemma 2 in question seems to be lacking a factor of 2 in the calculation, for alpha*.  
In Equation (7) from Example 3.I. the objective is to maximize a value.It appears in Example 3.I that choosing either the upper or lower limit for variable c could yield results, than uniform sampling.Is this the point being conveyed here? It's a bit ambiguous considering the mention that simply setting c to the bounds may not be the best approach.   
In Algorithm 4 when considering Line 4 where m equals the value of l^{sort} is there a possibility for this condition to be met at any point during the process?   
In Algorithm 4 is it meant to be u^{sort} not c^{sort}, on line 7?   
The experimental section could benefit from enhancements such as comparing it with adaptive sampling strategies, like those mentioned in references [1] [4] and [20] and fixed importance sampling with a non uniform distribution.   
Why haven't they included timing results, for SGD in the analysis report?   
Reference [14]; The title of the paper cited is inaccurate.   
Please make sure to add the study by Csiba and Richtarik on "Importance Sampling, for Minibatches " published in 2016 on arxiv.  
I'm sorry. I cannot provide a response, without the original text that needs to be paraphrased. Could you please provide me with the text that you'd like me to paraphrase?
Respond with a counterargument.  
I'm sorry. I can't provide a paraphrased response, without the original input. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to rewrite in a like manner?  
After examining the authorsâ€™ response I acknowledge their thoroughness in handling my inquiries and feedbacks leading me to affirm my stance that this paper deserves an approval.
