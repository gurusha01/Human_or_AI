Discussion. Overview;   
This paper presents the TranSync algorithm to tackle the issue of 1 translation synchronization uniquely.The method suggested differs from methods by utilizing truncated least squares to reduce the influence of noisy measurements.The authors conduct an examination of the algorithm and confirm its efficiency by conducting experiments, on synthetic and real data sets. 
Qualitative analysis will be conducted.  
The paper is nicely. Easy to understand with a clear presentation of the theoretical framework and detailed proofs provided in the supplementary materials for reference. The proposed method is comprehensively tested through experiments covering a wide range of scenarios.. Adding a brief summary of the main proof concepts in the core text could improve clarity, in explaining the ideas. Overall I appreciate the effort put into this work.
