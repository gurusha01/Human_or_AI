Thanks, for getting to me; I've gone over your reply thoroughly. 
In the past I didn't realize that the experiments didn't exactly follow the method used to derive the results.That's why I decided to lower my score by one level. 
This paper is really well done. Its carefully constructed with writing and very impressive content inside! It offers theoretical findings on deterministic quadrature techniques as substitutes for random Fourier features which I find quite intriguing and valuable, for the NIPS conference. 
On page 2 of the document at lines 72 to 74 I'm wondering if the assessment of QMC might be a bit too careful. Did they use higher order QMC in the reference mentioned ? Is there a reason to think that no QMC method could outperform the suggested approach ? Specifically could order digital networks with weighted RKHS and some similarities to the ANOVA structure be used in QMC ? For information refer to the book, by Dick and Pillichshammer published in 2010.

Please introduce the basis \( e_i \) before making any references to it. 
In the discussion on page 4 (lines 151 to 155) it might help to elaborate on how the comparison with RFF could be more detailed by pointing out that the new finding is based on more stringent assumptions than those, for RFFs given rate of performance improvement.Is it clear that RFF wouldn't outperform when considering the assumptions outlined in this study? 
Could you kindly furnish the explanation, for \(\tilde{\Omega}\) as outlined in Section 4?
