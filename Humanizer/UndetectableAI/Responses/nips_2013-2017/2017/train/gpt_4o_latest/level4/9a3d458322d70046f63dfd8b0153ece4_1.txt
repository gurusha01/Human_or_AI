The writers introduce the idea of Hamming distance (abbreviated as GHD) to offer a deeper understanding of how effective Batch Normalization (BN) and ReLU activation functions are, in practice. 
Upon completing a read of the paper; however I find myself still uncertain about its main contribution mentioned by the authors regarding GHD in relation to BN and ReLU comprehension detailed across two paragraphs, on pages 4 and 5 for clarification purposes specifically focused on Batch Normalization as succinctly summarized in the statement provided below; 
BN is actually trying to make up for the lack of output from neurons in relation to GHD, which supports our theory that a well function neuron should accurately gauge the GHD, between inputs and weights. 
This statement doesn't really explain how Batch Normalization impacts performance or results, in a way. 
The authors then introduce a Hamming network (GHN) asserting that it has clarified and validated the efficiency of real world methods, like batch normalization and ReLU. 
In a nutshell the paper is not well written. Doesn't offer any groundbreaking technical advancements or fresh ideas. Moreover it doesn't delve into the aspects of how effective BN or ReLUs are. Apart from the lack of originality and technical value the manuscript is filled with spelling mistakes, grammar errors and problems, with sentence structure (you can find a detailed list in the abstract and introduction).
This document unequivocally denies the proposal. 
I've noticed some typos and grammar syntax errors.
