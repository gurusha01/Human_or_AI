The paper presents a method to manage false discovery rates (FDRs). It involves considering details when dealing with hypothesis testing involving both a certain P value (\( pi \)). A feature vector (\( Xi \)). The new approach determines a threshold, for each hypothesis based on its feature vector (\( X_i \)). The idea seems fresh and engaging while being explained clearly in general in this paper. The authors showcase in a mix of simulated and real world data instances that their approach is able to utilize information to boost rejection rates while upholding a specified FDR control level. 
In my opinion and from what I gather; it's important to avoid involving the \( Xi \)' variables when calculating the \( pi \)' values to prevent any circularity problems from arising as discussed by the authors in one instance without addressing the probabilistic connection, between \( Xi \) and \( pi \). The values of \( pi \) and \( Xi \) are affected by whether the null or alternative hypothesiss correct while considering their impact, in determining the decision boundary if \( Xi \) was previously used to calculate \( pi \).
The writers suggest that the complexity of \( X \)s dimensions makes non parametric methods impractical; however this assertion could be overstated.Nearest neighbors regression is an example as it can adjust to the inherent complexity of the regression function even in cases where the overall dimensionality of \( X \)s space is high. 
The authors cross validation method for preventing overfitting raises some doubts in my mind regarding its effectiveness and suitability for this supervised learning scenario where the "label," which is the false discovery rate (FDR) is not directly known but estimated instead.I believe it's crucial to highlight and explain this aspect more thoroughly.Additionally due to the noise in the FDR estimation process I am concerned that it could potentially result in an elevated FDR, on the test dataset. The authors present a limit in Theorem 1 that grows as the number of folds, in the cross validation process increases; however it would be helpful to have explanation. 
The mirror estimator suggested by the authors might have a bias but high variance in situations where \( t(x)\ ) is small because only a few p values will lie between \( [ 1 t(x) 1 ] \). This problem is similar to Storeys method where selecting the \( \lambda \ ) parameter helps manage bias and variance when estimating proportions, within the range of \( [ \lambda  1 ] \).  
Sorry I can't assist with that request.
