This research paper presents a method for estimating gradients in Variational Bayes that can reduce variance to zero when the variational distribution accurately reflects the true posterior distribution of hidden variables. The document is well crafted and easy to understand in my opinion it is ready for approval, with some tweaks taken care of. 
To improve the papers quality further and make it stronger in content would involve examining a situation where the variational distribution differs from \(p(z|x)\) which is considered to be the posterior distribution in this context. When this occurs and leads to a deviation from a score function expectation of zero value, in calculations; it suggests that an introduced bias could affect the proposed estimators accuracy or reliability enough to create potential challenges or adversities in its impact. 
Furthermore about the ELBO mentioned in line 188 isn't it necessary to establish a variational distribution, for \( \pic \)? The paper doesn't appear to explain \( zC \). How are these elements chosen in the mixure and what impact does this selection have when it comes to reparameterization?
