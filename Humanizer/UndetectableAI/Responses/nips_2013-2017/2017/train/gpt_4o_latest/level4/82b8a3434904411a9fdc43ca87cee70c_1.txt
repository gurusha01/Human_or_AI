The article discusses how to reduce variations when dealing with situations where specific instances may experience changes (like slight rotations or noise addition in images). The new approach expands on the MISO/Finito algorithms by using a substitute function, for each altered instance represented as an average of lower bounds that move over time. Nevertheless the lower bounds mentioned are only estimated due to the variations they represent the minimum limit for the particular permutation in use with the example rather than an average across all potential permutations as a whole. The authors highlight that their algorithms rate of convergence is solely affected by the variance originating from permutations (\(\sigma_{p}\)) at the point compared to total variance which encompasses contributions from example sampling â€“, unlike SGD. The paper wraps up with a series of experiments. 
While the algorithm seems to progress in itself the issue at hand is important and the algorithm is easy to understand. The outcomes are comprehensive as they provide theoretical assurances along, with reliable experimental confirmation. 
One criticism concerns how the plots are displayed; the font sizes in the legends are too tiny the yellow line doesn't stand out enough against the backdrop and the curves are only identified by color instead of symbols or line patterns which can make them hard (or even impossible) to understand when printed in black and white.
