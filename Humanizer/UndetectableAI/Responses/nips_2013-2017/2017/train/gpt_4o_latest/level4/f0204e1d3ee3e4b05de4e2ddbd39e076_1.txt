The article delves into the concept of enhancement by conducting a series of A/B tests and suggests favoring adaptive testing methods like the multi arm bandit dilemma while ensuring oversight on false discovery rate—an important yet unsettled matter, in statistical studies. 
The method suggested in this paper seems to tackle these difficulties and presents a thought provoking addition that could pave the way for a fresh avenue of research despite a few minor issues raised earlier. 
The paper addresses concerns; however it would be helpful to reference sources for credibility and depth of research conducted on various topics such as computer science and machine learning, alongside biometrics which offers valuable insights as well.   
  
Could you please explain how your idea differs from the concept of "platform trials”, in biometrics? Thank you!  
  
Please provide details. Explain what LUCD is all about, in your writing.   
Please correct "samples as " changing it to "samples, as."  
Line 260 needs clarification as the phrase "are ran." Please revise it to make it clearer.   
It seems like the concept of "truncation time" needs clarification as it is not clearly defined and its importance on the results shown in Figure 2 is not well explained; could you provide more details, on this?  
The motivation mentioned here is interesting. Might be better suited in the introduction section where it can be highlighted with examples, like website administration and clinical studies.
