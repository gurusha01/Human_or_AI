This study improves PointNet [19}, by using a framework to incorporate learning local context across increasingly larger scales. 
The presentation is nicely. The mathematical explanations are easy to grasp.   
The results, from the experiments show that PointNet++ performs well on tests involving pointsets.   
PointNet++ focuses on recovering details in its motivation; however the experimental evidence does not strongly support this assertion.   
My suggestion would be to approve the paper since the experiments conducted are well documented and show outcomes that are, at the cutting edge of the field.
