This study uses methods for identifying the best choice (known as best arm identification. BAI) in the context of Monte Carlo tree search involving two players taking turns in a game scenario. The main goal is to find the move for player A by carefully analyzing all possible future moves that both player B and player A could make in upcoming rounds. The researchers rely on a stochastic oracle to assess the values at the end points and aim to pinpoint the effective move at the starting point with a specific level of accuracy (\(\epsilon\) precision) and confidence level (, at least \(1 \delta\) confidence).The algorithms suggested utilize confidence intervals and extend upper and lower confidence limits from the bottom to the top of the tree structure where the highest limits represent choices made by player A (MAX nodes) while the lowest limits correspond to choices made by player B (MIN nodes). These methods are easy to understand. Well explained while being firmly rooted in existing research in Bayesian adaptive experimentation (BAI). The research paper incorporates progress in this field while clearly highlighting its unique contributions, in Section 3\.1 thus improving the clarity of the study. The authors present a theorem regarding the amount of leaf evaluations with a complexity of \( H(3)\) which shows enhancements compared to findings.The discussions involving algorithms and approaches are clear cut and the experiments exhibit notable advancements over previous techniques.Furthermore the paper delves into limits and potential future research paths that are firmly grounded in recent progress, within the fixed confidence BAI framework. 
The document is written well; the ideas are clearly explained and placed in context effectively for easy understanding and appreciation of the content presented here.Thank you for your thorough effort, on this piece of work. 
Here are a suggestions to make the paper clearer;. Make sure to mention Figure  in the text as it provides a visual aid that supports the explanation and can be found around line 111.. Consider explaining why two candidates \(at\) and \(bt\) are needed at time \( t + 2\) as this might not be immediately clear.. In terms of the experiments section. What is the reasoning behind setting \(\delta\), to \(0. 10 |\Mathcal { L }|\)?In Figure 4. the value of 2. 7 Seems a bit odd despite not impacting the outcomes directly Do people typically use such a low confidence parameter for these algorithms Is it common practice to conduct tests with \(\delta=0. 01 \Times 27\). Just \(\delta=0. 1\) Without considering \(|\mathcal(L)|\), in the scaling process Understanding Lemma 7 can be quite challenging as presented currently. The example that goes along with it does help in clearing up any confusion. Could you also include a line in Figure 3 that illustrates the ratios while using the same delta value? Just a quick heads up – 259. 9 × 1. 76 Equals 457. 424; Maybe consider omitting the numerical value of kl(δ, 1. Δ). Also worth mentioning that Figure 4 might be hard to view without zoom at around 300%, on my computer screen – maybe think about adjusting the layout or removing it altogether. My suggestion is to enhance the visuals by including two columns showing the names of the algorithms and the total sample sizes utilized. Subsequently switch to using percentages of absolute figures (akin to \( w^{ * } \), in line 281).
In summary this piece makes an significant addition to the current body of work, in this field.
