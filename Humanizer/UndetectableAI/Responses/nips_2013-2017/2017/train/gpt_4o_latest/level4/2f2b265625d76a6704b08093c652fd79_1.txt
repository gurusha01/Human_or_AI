This study delves into the f GAN framework that has been expanded to include f divergences.The authors introduce the information geometric f GAN (vig f GAN) identity by extending the connection between KL divergence and regular exponential families using the chi logarithm method.This identity provides a perspective on the f GAN objective function.Furthermore the authors outline a set of conditions for activation functions to achieve distributions, with factorization. 
The key theoretical finding known as the vig f GAN identity is quite intriguing and holds promise, for various practical uses; nonetheless the core principles can be difficult to grasp because of their broad and abstract nature. 
Section 6 states that there is a lack of clarity in the link between the findings, from experiments and the theoretical conclusions drawn from them.
