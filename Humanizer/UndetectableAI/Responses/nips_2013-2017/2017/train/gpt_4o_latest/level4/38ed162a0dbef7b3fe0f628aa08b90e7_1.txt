The study explores characteristics of deep convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) focusing on their remarkable resistance to groups of transformations and resilience against diffeomorphisms when the patch extraction operator, kernel mapping operator and pooling operator are thoughtfully crafted. Additionally the researchers show that with assumptions, in place these favorable traits of CKNss can also be observed in convolution neural networks (CNNss).
In terms the document is nicely composed and technically sound at its core The major drawback though is the lack of experiments to back up the theoretical discoveries including empirical results validating the assertion that CKNs display invariance to transformations and diffeomorphisms when configured correctly would be beneficial to incorporate
Moreover is another question that comes up concerning the use of random projections or specific kernel mappings with a limited set of Fourier series as potential alternatives, for approximating kernels? It would be intriguing to investigate how they affect stability.
