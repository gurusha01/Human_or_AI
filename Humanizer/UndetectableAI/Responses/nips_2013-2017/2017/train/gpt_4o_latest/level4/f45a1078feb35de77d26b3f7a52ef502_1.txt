The paper discusses how Wasserstein generative networks (WGAN) a method used for estimating point process intensity or hazard functions using objective functions other than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and introduces a computationally efficient distance metric to enhance accuracy in this process.The proposed approach involves a regularized formulation for optimization and employs recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However the paper lacks information, on the methods and datasets used for real world analyses which makes it difficult to reproduce the results and it would be helpful to have clearer documentation. 
The results of the experiment show that WGANTPP shows performance in different tasks when using simulated and real data sets; however the comparison benchmarks seem too basic in nature. For example; The kernel mixture process is limited to three components which causes three peaks in all outcomes. Moreover the self exciting and self corrective processes stick to fixed benchmarks despite the availability of literature, on semi parametric hazard function configurations. To enhance the comparisons further in studies like Goulds work presented at ICDN 2016 and the research by Weiss in ECML 2013 and Jing, in WSDN 2017 suggests employing similar baseline models can be beneficial. 
Would a distance measurement that focuses on matching neighboring elements than align the same elements in two sequences work better when dealing with random events interfering with data accuracy like extraneous events do, to the suggested distance metric mentioned above?" Furthermore; "In what situations could this alternative distance metric prove more beneficial compared to log like approaches based on likelihood?" 
In Equation 3 it appears that the second sum should be expressed as the sum, from \( j=i +     \) to \( m \) of \( y_j \).
In Section 3 of the document discussing uniform processes characteristics show that there might be a mix up, in the values assigned to \(\alpha\) and \( c \).
There are some typos that need fixing in the text like "demosntrate."
