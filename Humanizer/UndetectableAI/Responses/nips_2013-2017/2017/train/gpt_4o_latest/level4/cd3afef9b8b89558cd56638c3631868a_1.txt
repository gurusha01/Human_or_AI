The researchers in this study delve into regression on linear sequences in online scenarios They point out that previous studies have shown that learning online isotonic regression is impossible under a completely adversarial model This prompts them to explore the issue by introducing a random permutation model that is more applicable, in real world situations. 
The paper is mostly well written and addresses a topic; however there are a few typos and grammar issues that distract from its clarity. It is difficult to verify the claims validity and accuracy without results. 
In order to support the arguments presented in the paper effectively and convincingly it would be helpful to provide instances that illustrate how isotonic regression operates within linear orders, in online scenarios.
