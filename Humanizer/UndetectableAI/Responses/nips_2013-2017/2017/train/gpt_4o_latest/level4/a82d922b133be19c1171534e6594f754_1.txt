It is a known fact that the leave one out cross validation (LOOCO error for ridge regression is calculated efficiently using known formulas that modify the loss function value when a single data point is omitted. In this study the authors take this idea further by suggesting an estimated formula, for LOOCO that can be used with models as well. 
From what I know far this method hasn't been suggested previously and appears to have great potential. 
The manuscript is written well with a polished appearance and seems technically sound.
