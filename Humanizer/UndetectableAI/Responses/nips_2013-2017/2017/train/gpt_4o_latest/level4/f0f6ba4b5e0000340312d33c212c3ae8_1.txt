This research paper introduces a method for improving the conventional word hashing technique used for embedding representations by incorporating a weighted blend of various vectors associated with unique hash functions to depict individual words effectively and efficiently. This method can be applied using a predefined dictionary or in real time training scenarios. The suggested technique is easy to grasp and put into practice resulting in a decrease, in the total number of embedding parameters. 
The outcomes are quite impressive overall. The approach is elegantly crafted as well.It's worth noting that the hash embeddings seem to work as a means of regularization.However it would enhance Table 2 to provide insights into the vocabulary sizes chosen and the reduction in parameters achieved through hash embeddings.Also might be helpful to include a top notch model for the DBpedia dataset, in Table 3 [1].
In Line 255 of the text states that the ensemble would need the amount of training time as a single large model only under the condition that each model in the ensemble has a architecture with fewer non emdedding weights.It is implied that the number of emdedding weights in each network of the ensemble is equal to that of the large model; this would lead to a notably longer training duration, for the ensemble. 
Table 3 showcases the three models; however a more effective comparison could be made by separating the table into methods that solely use embedding and those based on RNN/CNN structures.Additionally it would be intriguing to assess these embeddings in RNN/CNN models that're more sensitive to context.Such an approach could provide insights into their effectiveness and performance, in various scenarios. 
A few quick thoughts;   
I noticed a typo in the text regarding the word "million(s)."  
Oops there seems to be a typo in your text as it should be "too much" of ", to much."  
"L148 needs revision as the sentence structure is awkwardly phrased."   
Sure I can help with that. Please provide me with the input text you'd like me to paraphrase.  
I noticed a typo in the table.  
Table 4 indicates whether these outcomes were derived by adding up the significance values. Can you tell me the positions of the least significant weights, in the rankings?
