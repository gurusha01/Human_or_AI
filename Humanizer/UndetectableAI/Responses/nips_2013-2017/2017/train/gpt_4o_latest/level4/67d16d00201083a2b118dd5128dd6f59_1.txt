The authors suggest using a method that relies on a Fourier feature based metric to measure the differences between the phase functions of probability distributions.This metric is based on the idea of Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Is paired with a kernel function.Through the use of the phase function the authors present a test, for evaluating distributions that have been distorted by added noise.The source of the noise is assumed to be unidentified. Some characteristics are defined,such as the positive nature of the characteristic function. Furthermore the characteristics of the phase are illustrated to be suitable, in settings where examples are categorized into labeled groups. The suggested structure is then utilized in datasets to assess non parametric two sample examinations. 
The method discussed in the paper shows promise and appears to be well suited for statistical issues with a defined structure that are typically difficult to tackle using traditional approaches. One way to understand this model is as a form of error correction for measurements impacted by a type of noise. It would be intriguing to observe how this framework performs when applied to data sources closely linked to signal decoding challenges, like device or satellite communicationâ€”a move that could offer more engaging and realistic testing situations. 
Nevertheless It may be necessary to explore or relax some of the assumptions made in the paper mentioned above regarding the indivisibility of the random variable Verifying these conditions might pose an even greater challenge, than the main issue highlighted by the authors.
