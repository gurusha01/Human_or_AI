The article introduces an approach called MAB FDR that combines multi arm bandit (MAB) algorithms with online false discovery rate ( FDR ) control to overcome drawbacks of standard A/B testing methods. The authors suggest using sequences of best arm MAB instances of A/B test sequences to allow for adaptable sampling and ongoing monitoring, with strict FDR regulation.The key findings of this study are establishing base assumptions for MAB scenarios. Creating consistent p values for ongoing monitoring tasks while proving that employing online FDR rejection thresholds as confidence levels for MAB techniques leads to reduced sample requirements with increased effectiveness and minimal false discovery rates (FDR). Through simulations and practical trials like analyzing submissions, from The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest validates the efficiency of this framework. 
Advantages
Novel Approach; The combination of Multi Armed Bandit algorithms with False Discovery Rate control offers a fresh perspective and tackles key challenges in A/B testing like ineffective sample distribution and the potential for erroneous findings, from ongoing supervision. 
The paper offers theoretical assurances, for controlling both FDR and power with thorough proofs provided in the appendices. 
The framework is very useful in situations, like clinical trials and online experiments where adaptive sampling and sequential decision making play a crucial role. 
The authors carry out evaluations using both artificial and real world data sets to showcase the frameworks benefits in terms of sample effectiveness and control over false discovery rates when compared to standard methods such, as AB FDR and MAB INDEPENDENT. 
Modularity is a feature of the system as it offers flexibility to utilize various MAB algorithms and online FDR procedures for future enhancements, in either field. 
Challenges
The practical application of the framework might be difficult, for those practitioners who don't have experience despite the solid theoretical contributions it offers. 
The paper acknowledges real world data in its framework. Lacks in depth exploration of possible challenges like changes, in environments or increased computational requirements that may occur in extensive implementations. 
The effectiveness of the system greatly relies on factors such as the discovery rate (FDR control rate Î±) and the selection of the online FDR method (such as LORD). A deeper exploration, into the sensitivity of these parameters would enhance the quality of the paper. 
The authors emphasize the effectiveness of MAB FDR, in handling samples however the frameworks ability to handle a large number of arms or experiments is not thoroughly discussed in terms of computational scalability. 
Reasons to Consider
