This study presents an approach for spotting and fixing errors in 3 dimensional neuronal segmentation by employing multiscale 3 dimensional convolution networks.The researchers outline two objectives. Error identification to pinpoint split and merge mistakes in an object mask and error correction to refine the mask, for the actual object.One significant advancement is merging these objectives in a way that the error detection network offers guidance to the error correction network resultantly enhancing segmentation precision and computational effectiveness. The research paper shows enhancements compared to the standard segmentation method and emphasizes how the proposed approach can help streamline the labor intensive task of reconstructin neurons. 
The research expands on studies in identifying neuronal boundaries and segmentations through convolutional networks [10, 29 15 6]. It goes further by concentrating on error identification and rectification as tasks rather than combined ones as in earlier works that mainly focused on merge errors [18, 24]. This paper stands out by including split and merge errors in the error detection process alongside introducing learning for error correction and regarding the network as a feedback recurrent convolutional net. Bringing fresh insights, to the domain. 
Advantages; 
The paper is solid, from a perspective and backs up its claims with theory and experiments effectively.The iterative refinement process and the inclusion of error detection and correction add value to the overall discussion. 
The paper is written in an organized manner with detailed explanations of the tasks and experimental processes provided along, with figures and quantitative results to aid comprehension. 
The innovative aspect lies in breaking down segmentation into error detection and correction tasks while incorporating the "suggestion" feature into the systems design for added uniqueness.The utilization of vector fields for rectifying errors and the feedback loop, within the networks interpretation also enhances its originality. 
The framework tackles a challenge in connectomics by lessening the need for manual proofreading and cutting down on computational expenses significantly. The outcomes show enhancements in segmentation precision rendering the method beneficial, for both scientists and professionals. 
Areas to improve upon; 
The technique is primarily designed for segmenting neurons. Lacks a thorough examination of its potential in other areas of image segmentation, like generalization aspects that could enhance the papers credibility. 
The paper discusses errors in detecting errors (such, as misclassifying spines) but it doesn't thoroughly explore how these errors affect subsequent tasks or suggest ways to address them. 
The authors mention that while there are savings emphasized in the process of error correction being iterative may still require significant resources, for handling large scale datasets; therefore a more thorough cost benefit analysis would provide valuable insights. 
The paper would be more insightful by including comparisons with segmentation techniques in addition, to the provided baseline to better understand the enhancements made. 
Reasons to consider acceptance; 
The article introduces an skillfully implemented method to address a major issue, in connectomics. 
The incorporation of error identification and rectification is. Showcases significant enhancements compared to the standard level of performance. 
The study is detailed and well explained; it offers insights that may spark new avenues for exploration. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The methods ability to be applied to segmentation tasks is not thoroughly discussed. 
While the expenses involved have been lowered to some extent they still carry weight. Could pose a scalability issue. 
The exploration of scenarios and their consequences is restricted in scope. 
Suggestion; 
In general this study provides insights into the realm of neuronal segmentation and error rectification. Despite some areas that could be enhanced the advantages surpass the drawbacks. I suggest accepting it with revisions focusingon enhancing generalization error examination and discussions, about computational expenses.
