This paper discusses methods for kernel techniques by introducing deterministic feature maps to enhance the existing random Fourier features (RFF). The authors suggest using Gaussian quadrature and sparse ANONA kernels to create feature maps that offer improved scalability in approximation error and computational efficiency compared to RFFs. The study showcases that deterministic maps can achieve error bounds with sample complexity of \( O(e^\gamma + \epsilon^{ 1/\gamma}) \) which's more favorable asymptotically, than the complexity of \( O(\epsilon^{ 2}) \) The study is tested on the MNIST and TIMIT datasets. Demonstrates similar or better accuracy along with quicker feature generation, than RFF. 
Advantages; 
The paper explores a drawback of RFF by eliminating its dependence on randomness to ensure more reliable assurances of accuracy and effectiveness in practice with the introduction of deterministic feature maps employing Gaussian quadratureâ€”a unique addition, to kernel methodologies. 
The authors offer in depth analysis by establishing limits for approximation errors and sample complexity across different deterministic methods, like polynomially exact rules and sparse grids within the framework of numerical integration research. 
The emphasis on ANOVA kernels resembling convolutional layers in CNN models is currently pertinent and significant due to the growing attention towards structured kernels, in extensive machine learning endeavors. Based on the outcomes presented in the studys findings show that deterministic mappings have the potential to equal or surpass Random Fourier Features (RFF) in practical scenarios. 
Validation Results; The experiments conducted using the MNIST and TIMIT datasets were thorough and extensive in nature as they compared deterministic approaches with techniques such as Random Fourier Features (RFF) and quasi Monte Carlo methods. The findings indicated that deterministic mappings led to a decrease, in kernel approximation error while maintaining a level of classification accuracy as other methods. Furthermore the feature generation time was reduced when utilizing maps. 
Areas of improvement; 
Scalability in dimensions is a key issue to consider when comparing deterministic methods to RFF (Random Fourier Features). Although deterministic methods tend to perform in lower dimensional scenarios compared to RFFs but the curse of dimensionality poses a major obstacle, in high dimensional spaces. 
Limited Applicability Note that these techniques depend on types of kernel structures (such as subgaussian kernels or sparse ANOVA kernels) which could restrict their broader suitability, for different kernel varieties or tasks. 
The experiments conducted are comprehensive; however it would be advantageous to include benchmarks, from larger and varied datasets to showcase the scalability and reliability of the proposed approaches better. 
The level of difficulty in implementing techniques like reweighted grid quadrature can be affected by the need to solve non negative least squares problems.This could lead to computational work and increased complexity, in real world applications. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article provides a contribution both in theory and practice to kernel methods, by introducing deterministic feature mappings with verifiable assurances. 
The experimental findings confirm the effectiveness of the suggested approaches in particular for kernels such, as sparse ANOVA kernels. 
The study is in a position to spark more exploration into precise estimates and their uses, in the field of machine learning. 
Concerns opposing approval; 
The ability of the suggested approaches to scale up in scenarios, with dimensions is still a worry since the amount of data required increases significantly as the dimensionality expands. 
The papers emphasis on particular kernel varieties might restrict its influence, within the community of kernel methods users. 
Suggestion; 
In terms your paper makes a strong addition to the realm of kernel methods, by tackling a significant drawback of RFF and presenting an innovative deterministic substitute option.The challenges of scalability and general applicability still need to be addressed. The merits of the study overshadow its shortcomings.I suggest accepting it while proposing that the authors broaden their horizon and explore potential expansions to different kernel varieties in forthcoming research endeavors.
