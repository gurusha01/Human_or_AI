The study discusses the task of handling large scale multi class classification using a unique method that integrates a multi class, to binary reduction technique with a double sampling mechanism.The authors introduce a (π κ) double sampling plan to tackle the challenges of class imbalance and computational inefficiency commonly found in classification tasks. The approach has been tested on datasets like DMOX and Wikipedia and shows strong performance in training and predicting timeframes as well, as memory utilization and predictive precision when contrasted with cutting edge techniques. 
Upsides; 
The new method of sampling suggested in this study makes a valuable addition to the realm of extreme multi class classification, by addressing the issue of imbalanced class distributions and minimizing dyadic examples to tackle the problem of long tailed distributions often encountered in extensive classification tasks. 
The paper offers theoretical backing by presenting robust theoretical assurances such as the use of local fractional Rademacher complexity to establish bounds, on generalization errors This enhances the credibility of the suggested approach and highlights its reliability when following the empirical risk minimization principle. 
Scalability is a suit of the (π,k) DS algorithm as it efficiently processes datasets containing up to 100k classes without compromising its predictive accuracy when compared to other methods, in terms of memory usage and runtime enhancements. 
The experiments conducted were comprehensive as they compared the suggested method with cutting edge approaches such as OVA, PD Sparse and FastXML to establish its superiority, in runtime efficiency, memory consumption and predictive accuracy particularly when dealing with extensive datasets. 
The emphasis on utilizing datasets such as Wikipedia and DMOX demonstrates the methods practicality in addressing real life issues like text categorization and tagging, in recommendation systems. 
Areas that need improvement; 
The papers theoretical insights are significant. The way its presented might be a bit tough for those not well versed in complex ideas, like fractional Rademacher complexity to grasp easily Simplifying the explanation or offering more intuitive descriptions could make it easier for readers to understand and engage with the content. 
The study only focuses specificallyon text classification datasets. Does not include experiments in recommendation or image classification areas as mentioned by the authors.The findings may be limited in their applicability due, to this restriction. 
Hyperparameter Sensitivity Note; The effectiveness of the (π k) DS algorithm relies on the selection of π and κ factors provided by the authors through guidelines; however a thorough examination of how these hyperparameters impact the paper would enhance its quality. 
The authors compare their method with baselines but do not include some recent approaches, like SLEEC and LEML which were mentioned in earlier studies; adding these methods would offer a more thorough evaluation of their approach. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The research article presents an well founded method, for addressing a key issue in the field of machine learning. 
The technique shows real world results especially in big scale scenarios. 
"The innovative ideas presented in this research make contributions, to the field by improving generalization and pushing the boundaries of current knowledge."
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The paper could use some improvement in its clarity, in the theoretical parts. 
The scope of the experiment focuses on text classification and does not delve into other possible applications. 
The thorough analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity is lacking. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted due to its ideas and strong theoretical foundation supported by empirical evidence despite some areas that need clarification and potential for broader applications, in future research.
