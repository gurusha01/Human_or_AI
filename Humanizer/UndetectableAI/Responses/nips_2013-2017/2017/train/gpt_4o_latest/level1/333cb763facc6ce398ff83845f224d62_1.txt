Discussion, about the article
This research paper presents the Multi Outlook Spectral Combination (MSCC) kernel as a strategy, for creating covariance functions for multi output Gaussian processes (MOGPs). Expanding upon the blend kernel utilized in single output GPs model development [cite] the writers broaden this approach to MOGPs by applying Cramérs Theorem to extend Bochners Theorem into a multivariate setting [cite]. The proposed MSCC kernel characterizes cross spectral densities using complex valued functions to capture delays and phase disparities while accommodating variable auto covariance parameters among different channels [cite].The authors test their approach using data and two actual datasets to show how well it captures intricate connections between results and its strong performance when compared to other approaches, in the field. 
The research presented in the paper builds upon studies on spectral mixture kernels by Wilson and Adams in 2013 and MOGP models like the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) as well as the Cross Spectral Mixture (CSN). While the CSM kernel brought in phase shifts into consideration before now; the MOSK kernel goes further by including delays and offering a more adaptable parametric framework, for analysis purposes.The authors also point out drawbacks of methods which lack the ability to handle delays or offer comprehensive interpretability from a parametric standpoint; positioning MOSK as a broader extension of these methodologies. 
Advantages; 
The MOS kernel represents a progress in MOGP modeling as it provides more versatility and clarity when compared to current approaches.The introduction of cross spectral densities, with complex values is innovative and thoroughly reasoned out. 
The paper is built on a theoretical basis and uses Cramérs Theorem to guarantee that the proposed kernel remains positively definite. 
Experimental Confirmation; The example created effectively showcases the kernels capability in representing delays and differences, in phase. Moreover real life tests conducted on climate and heavy metal datasets serve to confirm its usefulness. 
The way the kernel parameters are understood in terms of frequency and magnitude is important, for professionals using interpretation methods. 
Areas that need improvement; 
The MOSW kernel shows results compared to other techniques on simulated information and specific practical assignments such as forecasting Cadmium levels; however its performance is not consistently better across all datasets at all times. For instance the CSM kernel demonstrates performance, on weather related information and predicting Copper levels. 
The article doesn't delve into the computational expenses of the MOSN kernel extensively despite its enhanced adaptability; it's probably pricier in terms of computation compared to simpler models such, as SM LMC. 
Sparse Implementation Issue; The methods inability to handle implementation hinders its ability to scale effectively with larger datasets—a crucial factor, for real world applications. 
Reasons to consider accepting the proposal; 
The research paper introduces an well founded addition, to the realm of MOGPs. 
The suggested core concept is based on theoretical foundations and aims to overcome the shortcomings of current approaches. 
The tests show how well the kernel can represent connections, in both artificial and real life scenarios. 
Reasons not to agree; 
The real world benefits of the MOSMO kernel compared to methods are not always clearly shown in all datasets. 
Large scale problems may pose difficulties due to the absence of a streamlined approach, in its implementation. 
Suggestion for approval with adjustments is suggested here.With concrete examples of real world application the strength of the technical aspect and theoretical depth of this paper can be clearly showcased.The writers are encouraged to delve into topics, like scalability and computational expenses in their research endeavors.
