The research paper introduces PRUNE as a task Siamese neural network designed for creating network embeddings without supervision while maintaining both the overall node ranking and community related closeness effectively. The authors point out that current approaches fail to link proximity with link prediction and community detection aspects and suggest a solution through the introduction of a unified framework. PRUNE is optimized using an objective function that combines PageRank based global ranking, with a proximity preserving loss based on tri factorization of the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix. The design of the model aims to meet scalability and simplicity requirements while showcasing its effectiveness in tasks such as learning, to rank and classification using real world data sets. 
Advantages; 
The paper presents an objective function that links proximity preservation with community detection and global node ranking in a novel way while also building upon established theoretical foundations and connecting to PageRank and PM based tri factorization from previous research efforts. 
Using a Siamesess network to collectively enhance closeness and ranking objectives is a clever approach that showcases the advantages of multi task learning for improving embedding quality. 
PRUNE consistently performs better than leading methods like DeepWalk and node vec across tasks and datasets empirical evidence proves its practical effectiveness, in handling noisy data. 
Scalability and Simplicity are strengths of the model as it maintains a linear time complexity per epoch and works effectively with just one hidden layer and minimal tweaking of hyperparameters. Ensuring efficiency and user friendliness, for unsupervised tasks. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper is quite thorough in its explanations but may be difficult for those not well acquainted with PMT tri factorization or PageRank to grasp due to its dense nature and lack of clarity in certain areas An improvement in accessibility could be achieved by simplifying the content and providing more straightforward explanations, for better understanding by a wider audience. 
Evaluation Range; While the experiments cover a range of aspects in depth the paper falls short in investigating the effects of different hyperparameters (such, as embedding dimensions or Î»). Examining these variables closely could offer a deeper understanding of the models resilience and adaptability. 
In comparison to methods on a wider scale in PRUNEs evaluation process reveals that incorporating newer graph neural network approaches, like GraphSAGE and GCNs could enhance the assessment further. 
The paper briefly touches upon any potential drawbacks without delving into specifics, like handling extremely large networks or the understandability of the embeddings that are learned. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article greatly enhances our understanding both in theory and application as it combines proximity measurement with ranking and detecting communities, in network embedding. 
The tangible findings are convincing and showcase the models excellence in tasks and datasets. 
The practicality and ease of use of this method make it extremely valuable, for real life use cases. 
Reasons to Refuse; 
The complex and specialized language used in the paper might make it harder for a wider range of people to understand it easily. 
The assessment could be broadened to incorporate comparisons, with techniques and a more thorough examination of how hyperparameters are affected by changes. 
Suggestion; 
In terms the paper makes a valuable addition to the realm of network embedding and fits nicely within the NIPS framework. Although there are some areas that could benefit from explanation and evaluation enhancements; the originality of ideas and concepts presented in conjunction with solid theoretical foundations and practical results support a strong argument for acceptance. Suggested for approval, with adjustments needed.
