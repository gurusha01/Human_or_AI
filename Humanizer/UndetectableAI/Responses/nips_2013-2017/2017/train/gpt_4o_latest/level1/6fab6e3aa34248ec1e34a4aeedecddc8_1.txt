In this research paper put forward a method of combining language and visual elements by introducing Conditional Batch Normalization (CBN). This technique adjusts the visual processing flow of a pre trained ResNet based on linguistic input given to the system. The new architecture known as MODulatEd ResNet (MODERN) was tested on two question answering tasks. VQA version 1 and GuessWhat?!. The results showed enhancements, in performance compared to existing top performing models. The writers claim that they based their method on discoveries in neuroscience indicating that language has an impact, on the visual processing phases and conducted a study to validate the advantages of adjusting every stage of the visual system. 
Advantages; 
The paper presents a fresh fusion approach that influences how visual information is processed from the start breaking away, from the common practice of handling visual and language inputs separately.This adds value to the realm of multi modal learning. 
The suggested approach is logically sound as the authors have thoughtfully devised CBN to anticipate adjustments, in batch normalization parameters of completely substituting them which minimizes the chances of inadequate initialization and overfitting issues. 
Empirical findings show that MODERN has shown advancements in both the VQAv1 and GuessWhat?! datasets, surpassing fine tuning benchmarks and even top tier models such, as MCB and MUTAN.The detailed analysis underscores the role of modulating all stages of ResNet. 
The authors emphasize that Cross modal BERT Network (CBNet) can be widely used in multi modal tasks beyond just vision and language related tasks to include areas, like reinforcement learning or adversarial training as well. 
The paper is clearly written with technical details such as ablation studies and comparisons to baselines, for easy understanding and replication purposes. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The analysis mainly focuses in certain areas like VQA and GuessWhat?! which show promising outcomes; more tests in diverse multi modal tasks such as image description or video Q&A would make the paper more versatile and applicable, across a wider range of scenarios. 
The authors recognize that the process of backpropagating through all ResNet layers consumes an amount of GPU memory usage; this could potentially hinder MODERNs scalability when working with larger datasets and higher resolution images. 
The paper discusses research, on attention mechanisms and bilinear pooling but does not directly compare these methods in terms of computational efficiency or robustness. 
The authors mention neuroscience research to support the idea of early stage intervention, in their argument; however further exploration linking these studies to the proposed approach could enhance the arguments validity. 
Reasons, for Approval; 
The article presents an well founded method for combining multiple modes which pushes the boundaries of excellence, in Visual Question Answer (VQA) challenges. 
The practical findings are compelling. Showcase the success of the suggested approach. 
The approach is versatile. Could be used in various scenarios beyond the particular tasks examined in the study. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The assessment only covers two datasets. Doesn't empirically show how widely the method can be applied. 
The cost of using this method might make it challenging to implement in places, with resources. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted as it makes a contribution to the area of multi modal learning through an innovative and efficient fusion approach. Although conducting experiments, on different tasks and delving deeper into the neuroscience rationale would enhance the papers quality, its merits surpass these shortcomings.
