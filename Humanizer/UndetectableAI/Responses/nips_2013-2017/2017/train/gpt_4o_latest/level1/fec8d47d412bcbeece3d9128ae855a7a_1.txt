The study introduces Neural FDR as a technique for testing multiple hypotheses by incorporating unique attributes of each hypothesis through neural networks instead of relying on traditional methods like Benjamini Hochberg (BH). Unlike BH or Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW) which overlook features or assume basic feature patterns Neyral FDR utilizes a versatile discovery threshold based on features, with the help of a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This method allows the algorithm to manage continuous and discrete features effectively while still controlling false discovery rates accurately. The writers offer assurances for controlling FDR under conditions of independence as well as mild dependence and showcase the algorithms outstanding effectiveness on fabricated and actual data collections such, as RNA Sequencing and e QTL investigations. 
Advantages
Innovation in Technology; Neural FDR brings a progress by incorporating the determination threshold as a neural network model to represent intricate and multi dimensional feature spaces effectively. A step ahead from traditional methods like IHW that depend mainly upon binning and are not as efficient for features, with multiple dimensions. 
The paper convincingly demonstrates controlling FDR in scenarios of independence. Offers assurances in situations of limited dependence over time with the incorporation of cross validation, as a smart method to avoid overfitting being a notable inclusion. 
Empirical Evidence shows that Neural FDR surpasses existing methods like IHW in terms of discoveries made while still controlling the FDR effectively.This performance is consistent across datasets. From synthetic examples with different feature structures, to real genomic data sets. 
Interpretability is important because the discovered thresholds can be understood and match what we already know about the relationship between eQT discoveries and factors like the distance, between SNP and gene and levels of gene expression. 
Scalability is a feature of the algorithm as it effectively manages extensive datasets, such as the multitude of hypotheses in the GTEx study showcasing its practical value, in real life situations. 
Areas of opportunity
Neural FDR works best when there are hypotheses and a high proportion of alternatives present in the dataset showing uncertainty in its performance with smaller datasets or those with low signal to noise ratios prompting the need, for more research. 

It would be helpful for a thorough evaluation if Neural FDR was also compared not only against BH and Stores BH as well as IHW but also against other recent FDR control techniques, like AdaPT or SABHA. 
The paper touches upon the concept of dependence but fails to fully delve into the practical implications of this assumption in datasets with high correlations like linkage disequilibrium, in genomics. 
Reasons to Consider
