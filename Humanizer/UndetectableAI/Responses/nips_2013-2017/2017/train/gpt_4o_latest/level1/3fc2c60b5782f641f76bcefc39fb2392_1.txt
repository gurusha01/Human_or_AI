This paper introduces a comprehensive method for training probabilistic machine learning models that focus on optimizing task related goals in the realm of stochastic programming directly from end to end approach is proposed by the authors argue that conventional techniques that rely on standard loss functions such as log likelihood often do not match up with the final task objectives rather they recommend a structure that carries forward task specific loss, throughout the stochastic programming process in order to adjust the model parameters The study shows how effective this method is by testing it in three scenarios. A simulated inventory management challenge and real world tasks involving scheduling electrical grid operations and managing energy storage investments. In all these cases the new method performed better, than both maximum likelihood estimation methods and black box policy optimization techniques. 
Advantages
The research paper tackles an area in machine learning by emphasizing optimization tailored to specific tasks instead of using generic loss functions making a valuable addition to the expanding field of end, to end learning and stochastic programming. 
The method is well explained with mathematical expressions and deductions included in the studys analysis section along, with a thorough discussion of how gradients are calculated during the stochastic programming procedure—a notably complex technical hurdle. 
Experimental Validation Review; The experiments have been carefully. Cover various scenarios. From simulated environments to practical situations. The outcomes effectively showcase the benefits of the suggested method by showing enhancements in grid scheduling (38· %) and decreased fluctuations, in energy storage assignments. 
The paper is clearly. Structured in a logical manner.The authors have included information about stochastic programming,end, to end learning and alternative loss optimization to ensure that their work can be easily understood by a wide range of readers. 
Areas of improvement
The experiments are quite convincing; however the applicability of the method to fields or more intricate stochastic programming scenarios like multi round decision making is not thoroughly examined as suggested by the authors for further research, in their paper. 
The process of differentiating using the "argmin" operator, in stochastic programming is computationally demanding. It remains uncertain how well this method can scale up to tackle bigger or more intricate problems. 
The paper could improve its evaluation by comparing its approach not to Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and policy optimization but also to recent advancements, in task specific optimization or hybrid methods for a more comprehensive analysis. 
The enhancements in performance, for the energy storage task lack significance which undermines the assertion of consistent superiority.
