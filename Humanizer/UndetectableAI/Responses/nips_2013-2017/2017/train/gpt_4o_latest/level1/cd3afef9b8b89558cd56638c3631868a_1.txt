The study reexamines the issue of isotonic regression by considering the random permutation model as a viable option compared to the fixed design model. The authors tackle the task of monotonic functions to incoming data sequentially with the aim of minimizing regret in comparison to the optimal isotonic function looked back upon. They draw a link between regret and excess leave one out loss. Introduce effective algorithms with corresponding lower limits, for the random permutation model. Furthermore they examine forward algorithms. A group of approaches. And introduce a novel "Heavy Gamma'' algorithm that indicates potential, for attaining optimal regret limits. 
Advantages
The random permutation model brings an approach by tackling the limitations of assuming a fixed design in real life situations—a notable addition that resonates with how data is naturally collected and fills a void, in existing research. 
The paper offers theoretical outcomes like regret boundaries for the random permutation model and links, between regret and leave one out loss are discussed in detail alongside an elegant method of converting online to batch using established fixed design algorithms. 
Significance; The study of forward algorithms that are efficient in computation and commonly utilized makes this work useful for practitioners.The authors also emphasize the potential of the Heavy gamma algorithm to extend to orders – an important focus, for upcoming research endeavors. 
The document is nicely organized with defined issues and explanations of theories along with discussions on relevant research work presented in a clear manner using easy to understand examples, like scenarios without noise and clearly defined environments to help comprehension. 
Areas, for improvement
Experimental Verification; Although the theoretical analysis is sound and thorough in the research paper provided,direct evidence, from real world experiments is missing to confirm the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms. The Heavy gamma algorithm.Numbers backed trials would add weight to the arguments made and offer real world perspectives. 
Speculative Thought; The assumption about the effectiveness of Heavy gamma with a weight of \( c = \Theta(t^{ ̃\frac{ ̃}{}}\) is fascinating yet unverified, which results in an aspect being unresolved and prompts doubts, about its real world usefulness. 
The main emphasis is on linear sequences in this study with a short mention of partial sequences made by the authors The authors recognize this as an unresolved issue but the absence of specific findings, on partial sequences hampers the overall significance of their research. 

Pros; 
The research paper tackles a gap, in online isotonic regression by presenting the random permutation model. 
The research offers theoretical insights such as discussions, on regret limits and a deeper understanding of forward algorithms. 
The research is important, for both real world audiences and can be applied in different fields. 
I'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased response, without the original text you want me to rewrite. Please provide the text you would like me to paraphrase into a like version.
The practical effectiveness of the results is diminished due, to the absence of real world validation. 
The speculation surrounding Heavy gamma remains unsupported. The core contribution is uncertain. 
The findings may not be as generalizable if only a small portion of orders is examined thoroughly. 
Suggestion
My suggestion is to accept the paper with some revisions needed. The paper brings an addition, to the realm of online learning and isotonic regression by presenting a practical model and offering insightful theoretical perspectives. However​ it would be beneficial for the authors to delve into validation and elaborate more on the conjecture and its consequences. These enhancements could greatly improve the impact and overall completeness of the paper.
