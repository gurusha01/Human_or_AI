The paper discusses how Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCVs) which can be computationally inefficient in learning scenarios could be improved with the introduction of an Approximate Leave One Out Cross Validation (ALOOVC). The authors provide assurances regarding the effectiveness of ALOOCVs and show how they can enhance the optimization of regularization hyperparameters, in the empirical risk minimization framework. Additionally a gradient descent algorithm is introduced for tuning hyperparameters. Utilizes ALOOCVs to decrease computational expenses. The results from the experiments confirm that ALOOCVs accuracy and effectiveness are demonstrated across a range of learning tasks such as ridge regression and logistic regression, to net regression tasks while also showing its ability to scale and practical usability. 
Advantages; 
Innovation and Creativity; The ALOOC method stands out as a valuable addition to the field by providing a computationally efficient option in place of LOOC method.Its innovative approach of extending closed form solutions to smooth regularized loss functions such as PRESS, for linear regression sets it apart. 
The paper is grounded in theory with a clear link, to LOOC V and precise error boundary explanations; also well connects with Takeuchi Information Criterion (TIMC) and influence functions to place the research in context within existing literature. 

The paper is nicely structured with explanations of concepts and demonstrations of ALOOCWs advantages in practical situations, in the experimental segment. 
The content of the work is in line with the themes of NIPS focused on optimization techniques and theories in machine learning well, as scalable algorithms. 
Areas, for improvement; 
Generalization; The technique is based on assumptions regarding the loss and regularizer functions which might constrain its suitability for non smooth scenarios such as LASSO regularization issues (like L2 regularization). Even though the writers discuss this in relation to LASSO specifically mentioned concerns, about these assumptions could be looked into deeply. 
The experiments cover a range of aspects but including comparisons with top notch hyperparameter optimization techniques, like Bayesian optimization would add more credibility to the findings. 
Scalability with large datasets is a concern for ALOOCU because its computational efficiency is good but the linear scaling with sample size could be an issue, with extremely large datasets and we should consider discussing potential approximations or strategies for parallelization to address this challenge. 
The paper focuses on equivalence but could benefit from exploring how ALOOCVa performs in scenarios with smaller samples and higher dimensions where p is close, to n. 
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
The research paper introduces an approach that is both theoretically robust and highly beneficial, for estimating LOOCVMETHOD=. 
"It tackles a recognized computational obstacle in the realm of machine learning which adds significant value to the field."
The experimental findings effectively showcase the usefulness of ALOOCVs in a variety of tasks. 
Reasons not to agree; 
The methods applicability could be restricted by depending much on assumptions of smoothness. 
The practical assessment might consider extending to incorporate comparisons with methods, for optimizing hyperparameters. 
Suggestion; 
The paper should be accepted as it greatly enhances the evaluation of models and tuning hyperparameters in machine learning research and practice despite some minor drawbacks.
