The article presents a concept called "Contemplation Networks," which enhances the encoder decoder model for tasks like neural machine translation (NMT) and summarizing texts by including a secondary decoder to improve the initial outputs quality in a way that resembles how humans refine their drafts through iterations, for better results. The researchers showcase how well this method works by conducting experiments that yield impressive outcomes in the translation of English to French for WMT 2014 (scoring a BLEU of 41. In addition to that they also make advancements in text summarization evaluations like ROUGE scores. This study expands on studies involving encoder decoder models and attention mechanisms but sets itself apart by incorporating a reflective approach during the decoding stage. A departure from previous methods, like post edit revisions or review networks. 
Things we are good, at; 
The paper demonstrates technical proficiency with a solid theoretical foundation and thorough documentation of experimental findings.The proposed discussion network consistently surpasses established benchmarks such as stacked decoders and review networks, across tasks and datasets. 
The addition of a second pass decoder that utilizes information from the initial output is a unique innovation in this field of study. This method sets itself apart from methods such as review networks concentrating on the encoder aspect or post editing without comprehensive optimization end, to end. 
The findings show progress in improving the latest technology, for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and summarizing text content effectively This indicates that the careful consideration process can be widely applied to tasks involving generating sequences. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to follow with in depth descriptions of the model design process and training method along, with how the experiments were set up for testing purposes.The addition of real life examples helps make it easier to grasp the concepts presented in the paper. 
Areas, for improvement; 
During the interpretation phase of the process when using the deliberation network, in encoder decoder models the time taken for decoding is doubled, potentially hindering its use in applications that require quick response times. The authors mention this limitation. Suggest further research to improve inference speed but do not provide specific solutions. 
The study focuses NMT and text summarization without delving into sequence generation tasks such as dialog systems or image captioning that could provide broader validation, for the methodology. 
The introduction of a second decoder pass and the related Monte Carlo training method raise the complexity of the model. Could present difficulties in terms of reproducibility and scalability.
