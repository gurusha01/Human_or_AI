This study presents greedy optimization methods designed to optimize over the convex cone—a domain represented by the conic hull of a standard atom set parameterization.The researchers expand the scope of the Matching Pursuit (MP) framework to tackle this scenario lying between linear span and convex hull parameterizations—an area that has received limited attention in previous studies.They introduce Non Negative Matching Pursuit (NNMP) algorithms and modified versions, with assurances of convergence. The research paper shows that it achieves improvement for broad smooth convex goals and steady improvement for highly convex goals through theoretical examinations and practical findings.The authors also draw links, between their methods and current MP and Frank Wolfe (FW) emphasizing the versatility and usefulness of their technique in learning scenarios. 
Advantages; 
The research paper covers a gap, in existing literature by presenting systematic MP algorithms designed to optimize conic hulls—a field that has not been thoroughly explored in previous MP or FW approaches. The proposed algorithms are innovative and broaden the scope of using greedy optimization methods. 
The authors present theoretical contributions with thorough guarantees of convergence at both sublinear and linear rates and support these claims with in depth proofs of their findings.The introduction of metrics such, as Cone Width to assess complexity is especially enlightening. 
The methods can be used for a range of smooth convex functions and do not depend heavily upon specific assumptions regarding the atom set which makes them adaptable, for different uses. 
The results from the experiments illustrate how effective the suggested approaches are in both real life scenarios, like non negative matrix factorization and logistic regression tasks The modified versions display comparable or even better results when compared to existing benchmarks. 
The paper effectively places its contributions in the context of research, on MP and FW by offering a clear comparison and emphasizing its advancements. 
Areas of opportunity; 
The paper has theoretical ideas but might be hard to understand for those not familiar with MP and FW frameworks due to its complexity, in presentation style. 
The experiments serve as examples. Have some restrictions, in their scope; including more benchmarks focused especiallyon large datasets or diverse applications would enhance the validity of the findings. 
Additional computational burdens are brought about by the implementation of options such as FCMP as they require numerous linear minimization oracle (or LMO, for short). It would be advantageous to delve into the topic of scalability and the trade offs in terms of runtime. 
The paper should elaborate effectively to explain how the proposed methods can be practically applied and compare them to simpler alternatives, like projected gradient descent. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article offers a theoretical contribution by delving into a optimization field that hasn't been explored before and offering solid guarantees, on convergence. 
The suggested approaches are versatile and suitable for issues, with proven practical value. 
The project pushes the boundaries of optimization and provides valuable insights that may spark new avenues for further investigation, in the field. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The complex way its presented and the lack of real world examples might make it hard to understand and apply effectively. 
The additional computational burden of the solutions may hinder the ability to scale up for extensive issues. 
Suggestion; 
In terms and looking at the bigger picture in this document provides a significant addition to the optimization and machine learning domain of study. Even though there are some aspects that could be enhanced like how it's presented and extending its practical application, the originality and thoroughness of the research make it suitable, for approval. I suggest approving it with modifications to enhance clarity and tackle issues related to scalability.
