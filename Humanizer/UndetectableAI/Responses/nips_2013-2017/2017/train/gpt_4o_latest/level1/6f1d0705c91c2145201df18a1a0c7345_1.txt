This article presents a concept called Hierarchical Implicit Models (HIM) which are innovative Bayesian hierarchical models that utilize implicit probabilities and suggests a method called Likelihood Free Variational Inference (LFVI) an efficient inference technique designed specifically for these models. HIM enhances the adaptability of models like simulators and GAN by integrating complex latent frameworks such, as priors,prior knowledge,hierarchies and sequences. LFVI tackles the difficulties of drawing conclusions in interpretable models by utilizing implicit variational families and estimating density ratios effectively to provide precise approximations of posterior even with extensive and complex datasets.This study showcases the practicality of these advancements across scenarios such, as ecological modeling simulating Bayesian GAN for categorical data and generating implicit sequences. 
Advantages; 
The emergence of HIM and LFVI marks a progress in Bayesian modeling by combining implicit distributions, with hierarchical frameworks—a unique addition that expands the practicality of implicit models. 
LFVI is built to manage datasets necessary for todays machine learning applications as demonstrated in experiments showing its capability with datasets containing 100000 time series—an achievement not possible with conventional methods such, as ABC. 
The paper demonstrates the range of applications for HIM models and LFVI with interesting examples like ecological simulations and using Bayesian GAN for classification and implicit sequence generation tasks.The capability to work with data, in Bayesian GAN is especially remarkable as it overcomes a limitation seen in conventional GAN models. 
The paper thoroughly explains the LFVI algorithm by incorporating ratio estimation and reparameterization techniques to establish a theoretical basis, for the proposed methods. 
The experiments are well crafted. Contrast the suggested approaches with robust benchmarks such, as ABC and Bayesian neural networks showcasing convincingly the benefits of HIM methodologies and LFVI. 
Areas of improvement; 
The paper mentions the uncertainty in estimating ratios in LFVI. Falls short of offering a reliable solution for it.This may hinder the methods usefulness, in real life situations. 
The suggested approaches outlined in LFVI seem intricate and may demand a high level of proficiency for execution which could potentially pose challenges, for practitioners considering their adoption. 
The experiments cover a range but mainly focuson synthetic or small scale scenarios.The papers impact could be enhanced by showcasing the methods in a scale real world application. 
The technical content in the paper is thorough; however there is room for improvement in clarity, in some parts especially when explaining LFVI. This might be difficult for non experts to understand. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should be accepted in my opinion as it brings important contributions that are backed by both theory and experiments.There is a need for the authors to ensure the stability of ratio estimation and offer explanations of technical details to make them more easily understood.
