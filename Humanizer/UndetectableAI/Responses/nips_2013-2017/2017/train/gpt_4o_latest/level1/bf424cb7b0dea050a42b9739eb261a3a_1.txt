The research paper introduces a method called EigenPro iteration to overcome the challenges of using gradient descent (GD) optimization with kernel methods on big datasets specifically smooth kernels is a key problem with GD based optimization due to the rapid spectral decay of kernel matrices restricting GDs computational abilities causing excessive regularization and less, than optimal results. The paper proposes a method called EigenPro to address this issue by utilizing an approximation of second order details through adjusting the kernel matrixs spectrum with a key eigenvectors.This technique speeds up convergence considerably while remaining consistent with stochastic descent (SGD). The researchers show that EigenPro offers enhancements in computational efficiency and accuracy compared to leading kernel methods. Especially, on extensive datasets. 
Advantages; 
The research introduces an angle on how optimization and architecture interact in kernel methods by pointing out a previously overlooked drawback of gradient descent for smooth kernels The EigenPro iteration offers an innovative and feasible remedy, for this issue. 

The authors thoroughly analyze the aspects of the limitations of GD and the advantages of EigenPro in detail with insights into spectral properties and guarantees of convergence.The justification, for choosing the step size for EigenPro is also sound. 
The approach is both computationally efficient and scalable while also working seamlessly with SGD frameworks to tackle practical issues, in large scale machine learning applications. 
Validation; The study presents thorough experiments on various datasets to showcase EigenPros efficiency and accuracy effectively validated by comparing with leading methods, in the field. 
Shortcomings; 
The paper covers a lot of theory. Might be tough for those not familiar with spectral methods or kernel learning to grasp easily due to its complexity and lack of simpler explanations, in certain parts. 
The experiments cover a range of scenarios; however the paper could be enhanced by including more comparisons, with modern neural network approaches to help place kernel methods in the context of current machine learning practices. 
The computational burden can be a concern when using EigenPro the added expense of computing the preconditioner on massive datasets or in environments with limited resources, like randomized SVD calculations might still be too costly. 
Reasons to consider acceptance; 
The article talks about a drawback, in kernel methods and offers an innovative solution that is theoretically sound and practically efficient. 
The results, from the experiment clearly show the benefits of this method compared to existing techniques. 
The project could motivate exploration, into hybrid optimization techniques that combine first and second order methods. 
Reasons to oppose approval; 
The complex nature of the paper might make it challenging for a range of people to understand and engage with it. 
The computational burden of the preconditioner could limit its usefulness in situations despite being justified. 
Suggestion; 
This paper should definitely be accepted as it offers insights and advancements, in the area of kernel methods and optimization both theoretically and practically speaking. To enhance the work more thoroughly I suggest focusing on improving clarity and addressing computational trade offs in the revised version.
