This study carefully examines the drawbacks of using descent based optimization techniques with smooth kernels and introduces a new preconditioning approach called EigenPro to address these issues effectively The researchers illustrate that gradient descent is only effective for highly smooth functions and needs numerous iterations to approximate less smooth functions They also highlight that EigenPro enhances the convergence of gradient descent substantially leading to speed ups of, up to 35 times without compromising accuracy
The paper is nicely written with an thorough explanation of their analysis and methodology provided by the authors.The experimental findings are quite remarkable as they showcase how effective EigenPro is across extensive datasets.The authors convincingly compare the results to the findings, in the field presented in a way that demonstrates EigenPros ability to enhance or achieve similar performance levels with significantly lesser computational resources. 
The paper demonstrates key advantages, such, as; 
An, in depth examination of the constraints associated with optimization techniques relying on descent and smooth kernel functions.
A new and efficient method, before training called EigenPro that greatly enhances the speed of descent.
The remarkable results, from experiments showcase how well EigenPro performs on extensive datasets.
