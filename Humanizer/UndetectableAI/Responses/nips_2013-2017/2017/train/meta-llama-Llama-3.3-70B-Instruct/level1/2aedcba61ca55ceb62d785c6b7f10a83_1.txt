This study introduces a method to recognize the underlying additive structure within groups for nonparametric regression analysis.It outlines a definition of the said structure and introduces a kernel based approach with penalization to detect and estimate the nonparametric functions, within this structure simultaneously.This approach incorporates a measure of complexity specifically designed for identifying additive structures within groups through an analysis of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).
The paper is nicely. The authors offer a thorough and clear description of the method they suggest.The theoretical findings regarding the stability of the estimated group structure are firmly established.The experiments, with simulations and real world data showcase how well the proposed method identifies the underlying group structure. 
The paper has notable strengths, which are worth mentioning.
A fresh suggestion to recognize the group additive arrangement has been introduced to address the issue of high dimensionality and enhance the effectiveness and interpretability of complex nonparametric regression methods. 
A new technique has been created that combines a penalized kernel approach to detect the underlying group patterns and calculate the functions at the same time. 
A new way to measure complexity in additive systems has been developed using the capacity measure of RKHSes. 
The development of findings involves confirming the accuracy of the estimated groups additive framework. 
The paper has its flaws, such, as; 
The suggested approach might not be practical, for handling datasets since it necessitates a thorough examination of all potential group additive configurations. 
The selection of tuning parameters like λ and µ might need to be chosen as the authors have not laid out a specific guide, for selecting these values clearly. 
The approach might not handle outliers or noisy data well. The authors did not address the methods robustness in their discussion. 
The paper is nicely. The new method suggested is innovative and useful; though there are some drawbacks and room for enhancements, like computational speed and reliability. 
Reasons, in favor of acceptance; 
The research suggests a method to uncover the inherent group additive pattern that helps address the issue of high dimensionality and enhances the effectiveness and clarity of complex nonparametric regression tasks. 
The approach has a theoretical foundation and the validity of the inferred group additive framework is supported by evidence. 
The proposed method has been proven effective through simulation studies and real world applications. 
The supporting points, in favor of acceptance are as follows; 
The method suggested might not work well for handling datasets in terms of computational efficiency. 
Selecting the tuning parameters like λ and µ can be tricky since the authors haven't given a straightforward guide, on how to choose them carefully. 
The technique might not handle outliers or noisy data well. There is no mention from the authors about how resilient the method is, in such cases. 
Rating given by user is 8, out of 10.
Suggestion for approval with adjustments needed would be to tackle the shortcomings of the suggested approach like computational efficiency and reliability and offer a comprehensive guide on how to choose the tuning parameters effectively. Moreover the authors should explore the potential uses of the proposed method and compare it to other methods currently, in use.
