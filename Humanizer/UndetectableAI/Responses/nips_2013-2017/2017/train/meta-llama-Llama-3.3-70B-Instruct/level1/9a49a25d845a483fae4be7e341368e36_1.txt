This study presents a statistical approach to lessen bias in automated decision making by manipulating data before processing it further.The researchers suggest an optimization method that considers fairness in decision making alongside maintaining accuracy and individual privacy.A test, on data sets shows that this method effectively minimizes bias without compromising accuracy significantly. 
The article discusses research on fairness and bias in machine learning and touches on statistical parity as well as group and individual fairness concepts.A variety of studies such as those conducted by Feldman et al (2015) Dwork et al (2012) and Zemel et al (2013) are referenced by the authors to situate their work within the scope of existing research, in this field. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
The authors present a probabilistic approach for pre processing to prevent discrimination in a notable addition, to the field. 
The optimization problem suggested is convex in nature. This allows for achieving the optimal solution efficientlyâ€”a key advantage, in the field of machine learning. 
The authors offer assurances for their method that encompass limits, on how quickly the optimization problem converges. 
The paper presents a real world assessment using two datasets to show how the method effectively minimizes discrimination. 
The paper has its flaws, such, as; 
The suggested framework and optimization issue might prove difficult to grasp and apply for professionals lacking a foundation, in optimization and probability theory. 
The authors only compare their method to one approach (known as LFR) and this comparison is restricted to a particular scenario. 
Fine tuning parameters, like the distortion discrimination control level might need careful adjustment that takes up time and expertise. 
On the side of things there are reasons to consider acceptance.
The paper presents a perspective and method, for minimizing bias in algorithmic decision making processes. 
The authors offer assurances for the technique to build confidence, in its effectiveness. 
The paper presents an assessment using real world datasets to showcase how effective the approach is, in practice. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The framework and optimization issue presented could pose a challenge for practitioners to grasp and put into practice. 
The authors only compared their method to one approach which might not give a complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach. 
Parameter adjustment can be quite meticulous and time consuming, at times as it necessitates a selection of parameters that demands expertise. 
The paper makes a valuable contribution to the study of fairness and bias in machine learning by offering an analysis of their methods both theoretically and empirically tested despite facing some limitations and obstacles, in its implementation.
