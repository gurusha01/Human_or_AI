This study introduces a method for guarantee safe operating conditions, in contextual linear bandits—an important consideration when applying learning algorithms to practical decision making scenarios.The researchers define a linear bandit problem in which the algorithms performance must meet or exceed a portion of a baseline policys performance. A cautious variant of the linear UCB algorithm named CLUCUB is suggested by them to adhere to the safety requirement with a high likelihood while maintaining a regret threshold similar, to LUCUB with an additional constant that is not time dependent. 
The manuscript is nicely crafted with an succinct overview of the issue at hand and the authors’ methodology, in addressing it showcased well in an orderly manner throughout the technical segments to help readers comprehend their arguments and validations effectively.The outcomes of the experiments highlight the efficiency of the suggested algorithm while shedding light onto how it functions in practice.
