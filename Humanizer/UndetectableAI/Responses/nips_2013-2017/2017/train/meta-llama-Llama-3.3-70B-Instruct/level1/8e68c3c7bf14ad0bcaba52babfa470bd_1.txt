This study introduces a method for integrating human input into reinforcement learning (RL) for describing images through captions effectively. The researchers suggest that feedback in language can offer more valuable insights for learning than just numerical rewards because it can identify errors and propose improvements in a specific manner. The study introduces a phrase based RNN captioning model that can be combined with human feedback along, with a feedback network that rewards the learner based on the input received. 
The article is nicely written and well structured; It provides an overview of prior studies and a detailed description of the proposed strategy. The testing phase is well thought out. Proves the efficiency of the suggested technique by surpassing standard RL models and attaining top notch outcomes in the MS COCO dataset. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
A new method has been suggested to integrate feedback from humans into reinforcement learning (RL) aiming to enhance the capabilities of RL agents, across tasks. 
The development of a phrase based RNN captioning model that can incorporate input from humans represents a notable advancement, in the realm of image description generation. 
An, in depth assessment of the suggested approach showcases its efficiency while shedding light on both its advantages and limitations. 
The paper has some flaws, such, as; 
Relying heavily on data annotated by humans can be a time consuming and costly endeavor to gather. 
The chance of errors and personal opinions creeping into the feedback data could impact how well the suggested approach works. 
The papers narrow focus, on image tasks may not translate directly to other reinforcement learning tasks.
