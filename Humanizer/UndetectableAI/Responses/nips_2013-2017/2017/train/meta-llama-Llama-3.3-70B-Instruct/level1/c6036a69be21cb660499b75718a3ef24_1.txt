The document suggests a method for handling sequence generation tasks like machine translation and text summarization, within the encoder decoder framework by incorporating a deliberation process into the mix.The authors posit that the conventional single pass decoding method is limited in its capacity to enhance and refine the output sequenceâ€”a characteristic often seen in human thought processes. They suggest a deliberation network with two decoders, in place. The first one creates a sequence while the second one fine tunes and perfects that sequence further. 
The article is nicely. Effectively elucidates the rationale and structure of the deliberation network concept.The writers offer an account of the frameworks components such as the encoder and first pass decoder along with the optimization method utilized for model training.The results from experiments highlight how well the deliberation network performs in tasks, like machine translation and text summarization. 
The papers notable aspects encompass; 
A new method for creating sequences has been introduced, aiming to overcome the constraints of one step decoding methods, in task execution sequences. 
The thorough and precise breakdown of the deliberation network structure and the optimization method used. 
The results, from the experiment show how well the deliberation network performs in handling two tasks involving generating sequences. 
There are some drawbacks, to the paper.
The document presumes that the audience has knowledge of the encoder decoder structure and tasks related to sequence generation challenges; this could pose a challenge for individuals without expertise, in the field. 
The research could improve by delving into the findings and exploring the limitations and possible downsides of the deliberation network. 
The paper lacks a comparison with other relevant studies, like post editing and review networks that could enhance our comprehension of the deliberation networks contributions. 
Reasons supporting approval; 
The article suggests a method, for tackling sequence generation tasks, which deals with a major drawback of conventional one pass decoding methods. 
The results, from the experiment show how well the deliberation network performs in handling two tasks related to generating sequences. 
The article is nicely. Effectively outlines the reasons behind and the structure of the discussion network. 
Reasons to oppose it; 
The article presumes that the reader has knowledge of the encoder decoder framework and tasks related to generating sequences; this could pose a challenge for individuals who are not experts, in the field. 
The paper could be improved by delving into the results thoroughly and addressing the limitations and potential downsides of the deliberation network. 
The paper lacks a comparison with other relevant research areas, like post editing and review networks to enhance our grasp of the deliberation networks contributions. 
In my opinion the paper is nicely. Presents a fresh angle on sequence generation tasks.The experimental findings showcase the efficiency of the deliberation network. Add value to the field.However a deeper examination of the results and a direct comparison, with studies would enhance the papers quality.In my view the paper could be accepted with adjustments to tackle these issues.
