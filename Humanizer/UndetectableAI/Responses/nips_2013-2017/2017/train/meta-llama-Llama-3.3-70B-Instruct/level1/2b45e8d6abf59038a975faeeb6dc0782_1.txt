This study suggests a method for calculating the difference between two probability distributions using samples, which they call the Population Matching Discrepancy (PMD). PMDis described as finding the minimum matching between two sets of data from the distributions.The researchers show that PMDis an estimator of the initial Wasserstein metric and introduce a stochastic gradient descent approach to adjust distribution parameters using PMDas a foundation, for learning. 
The paper is nicely written with clear presentation of ideas, by the authors. They have done an analysis of how PMDs and the Wasserstein metric are related and highlighted the benefits of using PMDs over the well known Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) approach. Through their experiments results its clearly shown that PMDs outshine MMDs in tasks related to domain adaptation and generative modeling both in terms of performance and speed of convergence. 
The papers notable aspects encompass; 
A new and well thought out method has been suggested for determining the distance between two probability distributions, in a manner. 

The presentation highlights the benefits of PMDs compared to MMDs in terms of having hyperparameters and stronger gradients while using smaller mini batch sizes. 
Applying PMDs to domain adaptation and generative modeling tasks has shown outcomes. 
The papers drawbacks are as follows; 
The expenses involved in performing PMDs can escalate significantly when dealing with population sizes. 
The absence of error limits, for PMDs hinders a thorough grasp of its theoretical characteristics. 
The experimental evaluation is limited as it only focuses on two tasks and does not offer a comparison, with alternative methods. 
Reasons supporting approval; 
The paper suggests an theoretically sound method for calculating the gap, between two probability distributions. 
The test outcomes show how well PMDs work in adapting to domains and creating models, from scratch. 
The article thoroughly examines how PMDs and the Wasserstein metric are connectedâ€”an addition, to the field of study. 
Reasons to oppose it; 
The expense of performing PMDs may become burdensome when dealing with populations and may restrict its practicality, in certain scenarios. 
The absence of limits on errors, in finite sampling for PMDs may create doubts regarding its theoretical characteristics. 
The restricted experimental assessment might not offer a grasp of the advantages and disadvantages of PMDs. 
In my opinion and evaluation of the content provided in the document suggests that it would be beneficial to approve the submission due to its theoretically robust method for calculating the disparity between two probability distributions which shows potential for success in tasks related to adapting domains and creating models generatively. Nevertheless there is a need for the authors to acknowledge and work on improving aspects such, as the computational expenses and absence of error bounds based on finite samples in upcoming research endeavors.
