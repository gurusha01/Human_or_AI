This research paper suggests two methods to incorporate resistance to noise into the measurements of distribution distances. One method involves assessing the asymmetry level, in paired sample variances while the other method involves comparing the phase aspects of the samples. The paper offers an explanation of the context and framework which includes defining components that are symmetric positive definite (SPD) and random vectors that can be decomposed. 
The writers present the idea of phase discrepancy (PhD) a L2 distance between phase functions that remains unchanged by additional SPD noise components.They also create an outline of specific features for kernel K known as phase characteristics that are applicable for studying distributions.The document includes findings such, as statements and validations to back up the suggested approaches. 
The results from the experiments show how well the suggested approaches like the Symmetric Mean Embedding (SME) test and the PhD test perform on real data sets. The findings indicate that the SME test effectively manages Type I errors with significant variations in noise levels. Additionally the PhD test shows effectiveness compared to the SME test when dealing with minor noise levels. The research paper also illustrates how phase features can be used in studying distributions for tasks such, as distribution regression and multi instance learning. 
The papers positive aspects are as follows; 
Two innovative methods have been suggested to incorporate resistance to noise into distance calculations, between distributions.
Supporting the suggested methods, with results and proofs.
The showcasing of how the suggested approaches perform on both artificial and real life data.
The usefulness of phase characteristics, in studying distribution patterns.
The papers drawbacks are as follows; 
The idea of foundational distributions might not always be applicable, in real world scenarios.
The PhD tests sensitivity, to noise levels could result in higher Type I error rates.
There is a requirement for investigation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and constraints of the suggested approaches. 
The paper provides a contribution to the realms of machine learning and statistics, with its suggested approaches holding promise for broad use across different fields. 
Here are some reasons why we should consider accepting the arguments.
The article presents creative methods to incorporate resistance to symmetric noise additions in the distances, between distributions. 
The research paper offers theoretical findings and evidence to back up the suggested approaches.
The outcomes of the experiments show how well the suggested approaches work with both real data.
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
Sometimes the idea that underlying distributions cannot be broken down completely may not match what actually happens in real world scenarios.
The test, for a PhD might be influenced by levels of noise that could result in higher rates of Type I errors. 
More investigation is required to gain an understanding of the characteristics and constraints of the suggested approaches.
