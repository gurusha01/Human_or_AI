This research paper presents an algorithm called TranSync for solving the 1D translation synchronization issue. A task that involves determining the overall positions of nodes based on imprecise measurements of their relative positions. The method utilizes least squares technique by iteratively refining the solution and progressively eliminating inaccurate measurements. The authors assess TranSyncs performance in scenarios, with random noise models to showcase its reliability and consistency. Results from experiments, on both actual data demonstrate that TranSync outperforms the latest convex models in terms of both speed and precision. 
The research paper discusses past studies on map synchronization that involve the use of algorithmic approaches like greedy algorithms and optimization techniques such as combinatorial optimization and convex optimization methods as well as non convex optimization methods. The authors point out the drawbacks of techniques, like their inability to deal with biased noisy data and the computational expenses associated with convex optimizations. TranSync tackles these issues by offering an precise solution capable of managing biased noisy data.
