This research paper suggests an approach to reducing false alarms in scenarios where multiple A/B tests are conducted sequentially by utilizing advancements in adaptive sampling and online false discovery rate (FDR). The authors present a meta algorithm that merges arm multi bandit algorithms with online FDR techniques to enable ongoing monitoring and adaptive sampling activities.The framework aims to overcome limitations associated with conventional A/B testing methods such as the absence of adaptability,inadequate sampling efficiency and limited control, over false discoveries. 
The key highlights of this paper are; (1.) suggesting definitions of a null hypothesis for MAB scenarios; (2.) creating a sequential p value concept that is consistently applicable for continuous monitoring; and (3.) illustrating how setting rejection thresholds based on online FDR algorithms as confidence levels, in MAB algorithms leads to optimal sample usage and achieves high power while controlling FDR effectively. 
The researchers introduce a method called MAB LORD that merges a top choice MAB algorithm with the LORD online FDR procedure.They establish assurances for MAB LORD such as managing mDFR and ensuring power outcomes.The study also showcases test scenarios using both fabricated and actual data to highlight the benefits of MAB FDR over other methods, in terms of sample efficiency and effectiveness. 
The papers strong points are; 
The writers tackle an issue, in the realm of multiple testing and present a fresh and efficient resolution. 
The paper is nicely. The authors offer detailed explanations of the suggested framework and its elements. 
The theoretical assurances and simulations showcase the efficiency of the suggested method. 
Shortcomings of the document are as follows; 
The paper suggests that the averages of the arms are assumed to be independent and sub Gaussian; however this may not always hold true in real world scenarios. 
The authors have not thoroughly compared MAB LORD with online FDR methods to help readers grasp the strengths of MAB LORD in context. 
Reasons, in favor of accepting the proposal; 
The research paper suggests an efficient answer to a major issue, in the realm of multiple testing. 
The writers offer explanations and theoretical assurances for the suggested framework. 
The simulations show how MAB FDR has benefits compared to methods. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The assumptions made in the paper regarding arm measurements may not align with real world scenarios at all times. 
The writers should include comparisons, with other online FDR methods to gain a clearer grasp of the benefits of MAB LORD. 
The paper has an impact on multiple testing and online FDR control within the field and the suggested framework could enhance the effectiveness and precision of A/B testing, in different scenarios.The paper is almost set for publication once the noted weaknesses are corrected with some adjustments.
