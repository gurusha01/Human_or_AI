This paper introduces an approach to neural networks that is inspired by the idea of generalized hamming distance and offers a solid theoretical foundation for neural computing research The authors take another look at fuzzy neural networks and show how methods, like batch normalization and rectified linear units can be understood in the context of fuzzy logic. The suggested generalized Hamming network (GHN) is suitable for examination within the realm of fuzzy logics theory and showcases swift learning capabilities as well, as precise control features while delivering excellent results across a range of learning assignments. 
The article is nicely. The authors give a straightforward and brief overview of the context and previous research findings.The papers technical innovations are important.
