This study presents Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) a method for estimating density that merges the benefits of autoregressive models and normalizing flows effectively. The researchers show that MAF delivers top notch results across density estimation tasks for general use surpassing established approaches, like Real NVP and MADE. 
The paper is nicely written with an concise introduction to the background and purpose of the study provided by the authors.The technical advancements made in the paper are substantial. A detailed analysis is presented by the authors regarding the connection between MAF and other established methods, like Inverse Autoregressive Flow and Real NVP. 
The thorough assessment of MAF is extensive as it encompasses datasets and tasks such, as unconditional and conditional density estimation experiments. The outcomes exhibit the efficiency of MAF in representing densities and its capacity to leverage conditional data. 
The papers strong points are; 
Introducing an innovative method, for estimating density.
In depth examination of the correlation, between MAF and alternative established techniques.
Extensive real world testing, across datasets and tasks. 
Simple and straightforward writing style.
