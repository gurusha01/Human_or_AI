This study introduces a type of recurrent neural network called the Fast Slow RNN (FS RNN) which merges the advantages of multiscale RNN models and deep transition RNN models to handle sequential information on various time scales and grasp intricate transitions between time steps effectively in language modeling tasks using datasets, like Penn Treebank and Hutter Prize Wikipedia where they achieved leading performance outcomes. The study also explores the examination of how the FS RNN learns and operates within a network setting to achieve better results, than other types of RNN structures. 
The paper is nicely written with an concise explanation of the proposed architecture and its benefits provided by the authors.The related work section is comprehensive as it offers an overview of current RNN architectures and their constraints.The experimental findings are remarkable, with an analysis of how well the FS RNN performed across two datasets. 
The papers positive aspects are...
A new RNN design idea that merges the advantages of multiscale and deep transition RNN models.
Achieving top notch performance, in two character level language modeling datasets. 
An in depth examination of how the FS RNN learns and operates, within a network. 
Here is a straightforward and brief description of the suggested design and its benefits.
One of the drawbacks of this paper is that it has its weaknesses.
The absence of an evaluation in comparison to other advanced RNN designs, like the Recurrent Highway Network (RHN) and the Clockwork RNN.
The evaluation of the FS RNN was limited to two datasets. This may not accurately reflect how well it performs on tasks and datasets.
A thorough examination of the intricacies and memory demands of the FS RNN is required.
Reasons supporting approval; 
A new RNN design is suggested to outperform existing models, on two character level language datasets.
The in depth examination of how the FS RNN learns and operates, within a network.
The FS RNN shows promise in enhancing results, across tasks and datasets.
Reasons to oppose it; 
The FS RNN has only been tested on a number of datasets.
The absence of a comparison, with other advanced RNN designs.
A thorough examination of the intricacies and memory demands of the FS RNN is necessary.
I believe this paper should be approved since its new RNN design has delivered results on two character level language modeling datasets and offers a comprehensive examination of its learning process and network behavior. However it would be beneficial if the authors could enhance their paper by conducting an in depth comparison, with other cutting edge RNN structures and testing the FS RNN on a broader range of datasets.
