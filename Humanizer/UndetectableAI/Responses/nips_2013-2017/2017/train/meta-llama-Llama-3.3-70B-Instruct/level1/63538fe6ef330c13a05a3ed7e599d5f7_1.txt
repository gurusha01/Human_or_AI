This study introduces an approach to non negative matching pursuit (NNMP) algorithms designed to optimize over the convex cone by representing it as the conic hull of a general atom set.The researchers conduct an analysis of convergence rates in both sublinear and linear forms, for these algorithms.They also present modified versions that ensure convergence and validate their effectiveness through practical numerical tests. 
The paper discusses the connections between matching pursuit (MP) and Frank Wolfe (FW) algorithms with a focus on their resurgence, in popularity lately because of their straightforwardness and reliability well as theoretical assurances offered by them in recent years Moreover they delve into optimizing over the cone that has not been previously explored by MP and FW algorithms. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
A new version of algorithms has been proposed in this research paper. The first systematic definition of non negative MP algorithms with clear convergence rates. 
A thorough analysis that covers both sublinear and linear convergence rates, for the algorithms under consideration is provided. 
The incorporation of error corrections, with assured linear progressions is now confirmed by numerical implementations. 
The proof of the practical results of the suggested algorithms across different uses such, as artificial data sets and non negative matrix factorization and non negative garrote applications. 
The paper has its shortcomings such, as; 
The idea that the atom collection is limited may not hold true in every scenario. 
Using estimates and simplified algorithms that might not work efficiently in real world scenarios. 
I didn't see any other state of the art algorithms like projected gradient descent, with alternating minimization being compared to in the research study. 
In favor of acceptance; 
The article introduces a version of NNMP algorithms that includes clear convergence ratesâ€”a valuable addition, to the field. 
The detailed examination of the merging analysis gives an insight into the suggested algorithms. 
The addition of adjusted versions, with assured progress is a notable enhancement compared to current methods. 
The practical tests showcase how well the suggested algorithms work, in real world situations. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The idea that the atom collection is confined could restrict how useful the suggested methods are. 
Using linear minimization oracles may not prove to be effective, in real world scenarios. 
It might be challenging to assess how well the suggested algorithms perform without comparing them to top notch algorithms in the field. 
The paper makes a contribution to optimizing convex cones and offers algorithms that could find broad applications in fields, like signal processing and machine learning. Nevertheless the papers drawbacks. Like assuming bounded atom sets and relying on linear minimization oracles. Need thorough evaluation.
