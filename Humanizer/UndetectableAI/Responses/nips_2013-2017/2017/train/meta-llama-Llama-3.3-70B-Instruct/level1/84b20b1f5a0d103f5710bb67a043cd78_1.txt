This article suggests a stochastic greedy coordinate descent (ASGCD) technique for addressing problems with `regularization. The writers present a guideline for the selection of greedy choices founded on an approximation of the square of the `norm, which is challenging to tackle but convex, in nature. They then introduce an algorithm named Soft Thresholding Projection (STP) to precisely address the problem of `regularized `norm square approximation. The SOTOPO algorithm incurs a cost of O(d + | Q | log | Q |) which outperforms the O(d log d ) cost of its rival, SOPOPO. 
The ASGD algorithm merges the rule and SOTOPO algorithm with Nesterovs acceleration and stochastic optimization techniques yielding optimal convergence at a rate of O(sqrt(CL‚ÇÅ)||ùë•‚àó||‚ÇÅ sqrt). Moreover ASGD decreases the iteration complexity of selection by a factor corresponding to the sample size as showcased by the experimental outcomes indicating superior performance in high dimensional dense scenarios, with sparse solutions compared to existing algorithms.
