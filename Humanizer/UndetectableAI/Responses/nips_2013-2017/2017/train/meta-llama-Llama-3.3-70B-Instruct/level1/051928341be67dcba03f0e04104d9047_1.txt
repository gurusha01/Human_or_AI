This research introduces a way of focusing on details that captures complex relationships among different types of data sources and proves to be successful in solving visual question answering challenges (VQA). The writers conduct an examination of previous studies, on attention mechanisms by pointing out the drawbacks of current methods and advocating for a versatile and adaptable attention strategy. 
The suggested attention method relies on a model that grasps unary and pairwise potentials as well as ternary potentials to understand connections between various types of data. The creators showcase the success of their technique, on the VQA dataset. Accomplish top notch results using a fairly straightforward model. 
The paper is nicely. The authors offer a straightforward and brief description of their method.The experimental outcomes are comprehensive. The authors present an, in depth evaluation of how well their model performs. 
Advantages;
