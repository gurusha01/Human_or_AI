This research paper presents a stochastic optimization method known as Stochastic MISO that aims to reduce a complex and strongly convex objective function by incorporating random variations in input data. The algorithm is an advancement of the MISO/Finito algorithms that utilize approaches leveraging variance reduction methods. The authors extensively discuss the algorithms convergence characteristics by applying an approach, to a Lyapunov function and achieving a convergence rate of O(1/t) for expected suboptimality.
