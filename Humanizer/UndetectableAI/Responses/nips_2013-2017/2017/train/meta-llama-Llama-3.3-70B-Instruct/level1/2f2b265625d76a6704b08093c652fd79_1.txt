This study makes a contribution to the exploration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) specifically their extension to f divergences.An insightful connection is established by the authors between the f GAN game and a geometrical optimization issue through an information geometric identity.This sheds light on how the generator functions, within the game.The paper is articulated effectively. Showcases the authors deep comprehension of the topic. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The paper is solid, from a standpoint; it includes thorough proofs and derivations that back up the authors’ assertions. 
The article offers a take, on GAN technology by linking it to information geometry and offering a new insight into the world of supervised gaming. 
The paper is nicely structured with to follow explanations of the technical ideas and notation given by the authors. 
It does come with its own set of limitations. 
The article presumes a mathematical acumen from its readership which might pose difficulties, for some individuals in comprehending the content thoroughly. 
The paper is quite long. This might make it hard for some readers to fully grasp what the authors are trying to convey. 
To enhance the paper further 
The paper is well researched and accurate; however some readers might find it challenging to grasp the reasoning, behind the authors’ findings without more intuitive explanations or concrete examples to enhance accessibility. 
The authors could strengthen their findings by including experimental results to showcase the real world impact of their contributions more effectively.
