This article introduces a method called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM) designed to address the graph matching challenge in computer vision—an essential task, in this field. The problem of graph matching is outlined as a Quadratic Programming (QP) involving stochastic and discrete constraints. The writers suggest using a method involving multiplying numbers to address the Qudratic Programming (QP) issue and with three key advantages; 1) It resolves the overall Qudratic Programming problem with a doubly stochastic limitation in an organic manner. 2) It produces a solution that is lacking in complexity and can therefore include the constraint, as an approximation. 3) It is both straightforward and effective to put into practice. 
The paper discusses research in the field that explores techniques like constraint relaxation and projection methods such as GA and RRWM alongside objective function approximation methods like the Frank Wolfe algorithm.The authors also contrast their approach with cutting edge methods, like SM, IPFP, SMAC, RRWM and FGM. 
The papers positive aspects are; 
The suggested MPGM algorithm is straightforward to use and effective in its implementation. It has a complexity of, below O(MN^​ ²).
The program will always reach a solution known as Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKP).
The results of the experiment indicate that MPGM performs better, than cutting edge methods in terms of score accuracy and matching precision. 
Sparse solutions can be produced by the algorithm for graph matching problems which is often considered advantageous. 
The paper has limitations, such, as; 
The algorithm lacks an element by not including a thorough examination of the scarcity of MPGM solution, in its theoretical analysis. 
The algorithm might not handle noise well based on the findings, in the experiments. 
Comparing with methods would be helpful as the current comparison is not thorough and lacks comparisons, with the latest techniques available. 
Here are some reasons to consider accepting the proposal; 
The document introduces an effective method, for addressing the issue of graph matching. 
The algorithm is built on theoretical principles and will consistently lead to achieving an optimal solution according to KKT principles. 
Based on the findings of the experiment the algorithm has proven to be more effective than cutting edge techniques currently available, in the field. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The theoretical discussion, about the scarcity of the MPGM solution is missing. 
The algorithm might struggle with noise disruptions. 
The analysis does not fully consider approaches. 
The paper provides an addition to the computer vision domain with its MPGM algorithm showing promise for tackling graph matching challenges effectively; yet more research is required to tackle the papers shortcomings such, as analyzing the sparsity of MPGM solution theoretically and ensuring the algorithms resilience to outlier noise.
