This research paper introduces a method for determining the best course of action in Monte Carlo Tree Search (a vital aspect of various effective AI gaming systems). The authors present a framework named BAI MCTS that merges a Best Arm Identification (BAI) technique with exploring the tree using confidence intervals, on node values. They put forward two variations. UGapE MCTS and LUCB MCTS. Which utilize confidence driven BAI algorithms. 
The research paper thoroughly examines the suggested algorithms by establishing their (ε,δ) accuracy and offering a high probability limit on their sample complexity.The authors back this up with real world testing that highlights the effectiveness of their algorithms compared to the leading FindTopWinner algorithm, in different scenarios.
