This study introduces a method for modeling multiple output Gaussian processes (MOGPs). It involves creating a set of complex valued spectral densities and utilizing Cramérs Theorem to develop a well founded multivariate covariance function called the Multi Purpose Spectral Mixture (MPMS). The MPMS kernel offers an explanation of how channels are interconnected based on frequency content as well, as magnitude and phase differences and delays involved in the process. 
The research paper is nicely crafted with an overview of MOGPs and spectral mixture kernels along with an explanation of Cramérs Theorem, by the authors.The new MOSMK is meticulously. Its characteristics are extensively examined.The thorough experimental assessment encompasses a synthetic case study and two real life datasets illustrating the effectiveness of the MOSMK when compared to existing MOGP models. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
A new and innovative method, for modeling MOGPs has been suggested that offers an explanation of how channels are interconnected. 
Extensively. Analyzing the MOS kernel to showcase its characteristics and benefits. 
The thorough experimental assessment showcases the effectiveness of the MOSN kernel when compared to MOGP models. 
The papers shortcomings are; 
The intricacy of the suggested method could pose difficulties, in its execution and computation processes – especially when dealing with datasets. 
The minimal comparison, to MOGP models might not offer a comprehensive view of the MOSN kernels effectiveness. 
The absence of conversation regarding the uses and consequences of the suggested method might restrict its influence and significance within the wider research community. 
Reasons supporting acceptance include; 
The document introduces an well thought out method for representing MOGPs that offers a straightforward explanation of the connections, among channels. 
The practical test shows that the MOSN kernel is strong in comparison, to MOGP models. 
The article is nicely. The writers offer a detailed overview and examination of the suggested method. 
Supporting points, in favor; 
The proposed methods intricacy could pose difficulties, in execution and calculations when dealing with datasets. 
Comparing the MOSK kernels performance, to a few other MOGP models may not give us the full picture of its capabilities and effectiveness. 
The proposed methods effectiveness and significance could be hindered by the absence of an exploration of its potential uses and consequences potentially limiting its influence, on the wider research community. 
In my opinion it would be an idea to approve the paper since it introduces a new and well thought out method, for modeling MOGPs and shows through experiments that it can compete with other existing MOGP models effectively. However I think the authors need to work on acknowledging the drawbacks and shortcomings of their paper regarding how intricate their approach is and how little they compare it to other MOGP models available.
