A new method for network embedding without supervision is presented in this paper. Proximity and Ranking preserving Unsupervised Network Embedding (PRUNE). Authors introduce a task Siamese neural network structure to link embedding vectors and maintain the overall node ranking and local proximity of nodes effectively.The study delves deeper into how the proposed proximity objective relates to tasks such as link prediction and community detection, within the network. 
The positive aspects of this paper are; 
The writers suggest a goal that maintains the ranking of nodes globally and takes into account community related closeness as well. A substantial advancement compared to current approaches that focus on just one of these aspects. 
The document offers an, in depth examination of the suggested objective function and how it relates to predicting links and identifying communities. 
The studies show how well the suggested approach works in supervised learning assignments such as ranking learning and making predictions on links in addition, to classification and regression tasks. 
The authors also conduct an analysis to demonstrate that their approach remains effective even when some connections are missing in the network. 
The shortcomings of this document are; 
The document presumes that the network is both directed and homogeneous; however this may not be the scenario, in real life networks. 
The writers fail to offer a guide, on determining the hyperparameters like the quantity of hidden layers and the types of activation functions to utilize. 
The paper lacks a comparison with advanced techniques, in network embedding like GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Network. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The paper suggests an efficient approach, for network embedding that maintains the overall node ranking and takes into account community relationships. 
The trials showcase how well the suggested approach performs across supervised learning assignments. 
The document offers a theoretical examination of the suggested goal function. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The study considers a network that is both directed and homogeneous; however this may not reflect the characteristics of real world networks. 
The authors fail to offer a guide, on selecting the hyperparameters. 
The article does not include a comparison with cutting edge techniques, in network embedding. 
In my opinion this paper brings an addition to the realm of network embedding and warrants acceptance. Nevertheless the authors ought to tackle the identified shortcomings by offering a guide on selecting hyperparameters and by conducting a thorough comparison of their approach, against other cutting edge methods.  
The quality is rated at 8 out of 10. 
The article is nicely. Offers a detailed theoretical examination of the suggested goal function; though the authors might enhance the papers clarity by offering additional insights, into the hyperparameters and experimental arrangement. 
I would need the text that you want me to paraphrase in order to provide a human like rewrite.
The document is nicely. Simple to understand; though certain parts, like the experimental arrangement could benefit from additional clarifications. 
The uniqueness of the content is rated at 9 out of 10.
