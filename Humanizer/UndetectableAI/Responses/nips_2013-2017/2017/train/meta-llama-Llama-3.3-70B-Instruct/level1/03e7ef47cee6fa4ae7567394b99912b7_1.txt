This research paper delves into a theoretical examination of interactive clustering with additional information provided by an oracle through pair wise queries to assist in the clustering process. The authors establish information theoretic limits and closely align upper limits, on the query complexity involved in clustering with side information. The papers key finding is that incorporating details like a similarity matrix can significantly lower the search complexity for clustering from Θ(n*k*) to O(k²*log⁡n* *H²(f+) + ||* f−*||* ) where *H²(f+) + ||* f−*||* represents the Hellinger divergence, between the probability distributions of * f⁺ and * f⁻*.
