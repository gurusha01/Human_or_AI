This research paper comprehensively examines the anonymity features of Bitcoins peer to peer network with an emphasis on the transaction flooding protocols employed to maintain network integrity. The study delves into the Bitcoin networking structure. Assesses its anonymity characteristics before and, after 2015 when the community transitioned from trickle spreading to diffusion spreading in its flooding approach. 
The primary focus of the research paper lies in revealing the lack of anonymity in Bitcoins flooding protocols and how the communitys transition from trickle spreading to diffusion failed to address this issue.The study highlights the optimal source estimators such, as the first timestamp estimator and maximum likelihood estimator while pointing out that both trickle and diffusion methods exhibit similar shortcomings in terms of anonymity protection. 
The studys strong points are its examination and assessment of the Bitcoin network model and the exploration of various adversarial scenarios along, with the outcomes simulated on a snapshot of the authentic Bitcoin P‌‌eer ‌to ‌Peer network structure from 2015 The writers also offer a concise and comprehensive breakdown of their methodologies and findings to make it simple for readers to comprehend. 
Yet the article does show flaws as well; It only focuses on typical tree shaped networks that might not truly reflect the actual Bitcoin network structure accurately; also it presumes that the attacker maintains a constant amount of connections, to every server which may not align with real world scenarios. 
Regarding the conference rules and regulations assessment of this paper reveals that it fulfills the standards for excellence in terms of quality and clarity while showcasing originality and significance well as being technically competent and articulately expressed which sheds light on fresh perspectives concerning the anonymity features within Bitcoins decentralized network structure.This work is well motivated by the authors. Illustrates its importance, within the domain of cryptocurrency and privacy concerns. 
Here are some reasons to consider accepting.
The document offers an examination of the anonymity characteristics of Bitcoins peer, to peer network. 
The writers. Examine nearly perfect source estimators such, as the earliest time stamp estimator and the most probable estimator. 
The report presents findings from a simulation based on the network structure of the Bitcoin peer, to peer network in 2015. 
The writers show that both trickle and diffusion have shortcomings in terms of anonymity properties. 
Points supporting acceptance; 
The evaluation is restricted to tree based networks and may not fully reflect the actual structure of the Bitcoin network. 
The writers believe that it may not be practical in real life scenarios for the adversary to have a predetermined number of connections, to each server. 
The paper would be improved by examining how the results hold up under various network structures and challenging models. 
I suggest approving the submission of this paper for the conference as it makes a contribution to the realm of cryptocurrency and anonymity, with its strengths outweighing its weaknesses.
