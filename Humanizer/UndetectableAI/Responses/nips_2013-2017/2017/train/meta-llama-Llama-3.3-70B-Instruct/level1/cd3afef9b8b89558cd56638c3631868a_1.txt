This study takes another look at the issue of isotonic regression. A process that entails fitting increasing or decreasing functions to effectively portray data within an online environment. The researchers offer a viewpoint by investigating the random permutation model as opposed to the fixed design model that was previously explored. A move towards a more practical and true to life scenario. The key highlight of this study lies in the creation of algorithms and corresponding lower limits tailored for online isotonic regression, in the random permutation model. 
The paper begins by introducing the issue of isotonic regression and its significance in different real world scenarios. Next the authors talk about the constraints of the fixed design approach. Highlight the importance of exploring the random permutation model. They create a method for converting online data to batch data that connects the fixed design approach with the random permutation model. This enables them to transfer the optimal regret outcome, from the fixed design method to the permutation model. 
The researchers also examine the category of algorithms. A widely used and effective method for online isotonic regression tasks. They demonstrate that forward algorithms deliver regret rates across the board and align with the best possible rates, in specific scenarios. Moreover they introduce an approach dubbed Heavy gamma, a variant of the forward algorithm that incorporates a weighted label estimate.
