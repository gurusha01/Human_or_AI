This study presents a deep generative model named MMD GAN that merges the concepts of Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The authors incorporate adversarial kernel learning methods to enhance the modeling capability of GMMNs and their computational efficiency. The innovative MMD GAN approach utilizes a two sample test using kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with learned kernels that leverages topology advantages and allows optimization through gradient descent, with smaller batch sizes.
