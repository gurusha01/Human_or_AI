This research introduces an approach called a new deep supervised discrete hashing method, for image retrieval that aims to generate binary codes maintaining similarity and label consistency at the same time by utilizing a CNN to learn image features and hash functions concurrently through the final layers direct output of binary codes using pairwise label and classification data. 
The paper discusses research on hashing techniques that encompass both data independent and data dependent methods along with deep learning based hashing approaches, in detail.The authors point out the shortcomings of deep hashing techniques for not fully leveraging semantic details and put forward a fresh strategy that integrates pairwise label information and classification details to acquire hash codes within a unified framework. 
The papers strong points are as follows; 
The suggested approach performs better than the techniques on well known image retrieval datasets such, as CIFAR\ 10 and NUS WIDE. 
The writers offer an examination of the findings that involves contrasting them with conventional hashing techniques and alternative deep hashing approaches.
