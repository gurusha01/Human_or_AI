The paper suggests a method for identifying and fixing errors in reconstructive 3 dimensional models of neurons from electron microscope images. The authors outline two objectives. Error detection that spots split and merge errors in a potential object and error correction that removes unnecessary sections from the potential mask to reveal the actual object. They apply 3 multiscale convolutional networks for both tasks and show strong precision in error detection and notable enhancements in error correction with guidance, from the error detector. 
The article is nicely. The authors have explained their methods well by detailing the structure of their networks and the training process they used.The experiments conducted are comprehensive. Show remarkable results, with accuracy and completeness surpass 90% in identifying errors and notable enhancements in error rectification by following the suggestions provided by the error detection system. 
The paper has strong points, such, as; 
The uniqueness of the method lies in breaking down the task of neuron segmentation into two components. Identifying errors and making corrections to them. 
The error detection network demonstrates accuracy, in identifying both split and merge errors effectively with high precision and recall rates. 
The notable enhancements, in error rectification achieved by following the guidance provided by the error detection system highlight the success of the suggested method.
