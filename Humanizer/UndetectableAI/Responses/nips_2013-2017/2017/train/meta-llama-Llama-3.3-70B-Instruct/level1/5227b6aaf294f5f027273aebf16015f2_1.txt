The paper introduces a learning approach called hyperspherical convolution (SphereConv) which involves projecting parameter learning onto unit hyperspheres to determine layer activations based on the geodesic distance between kernels and input signals. The authors present SphereNet as a hyperspherical convolution network that utilizes SphereConv as its fundamental convolution operator and is guided by a generalized angular softmax loss function. The study offers explanations for the benefits of learning on hyperspheres such, as enhanced conditioning and addressing training challenges effectively.
