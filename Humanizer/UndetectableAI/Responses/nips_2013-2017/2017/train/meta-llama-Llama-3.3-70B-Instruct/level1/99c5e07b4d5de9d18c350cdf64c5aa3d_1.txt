This study puts forward a method for interpreting brain signals in intracortical brain computer interfaces (BCIs). It involves using a Bayesian network with multi scale semi Markov dynamics to decode neural activity accurately. The researchers introduce a likelihood model that expands upon the conventional cosine tuning model by accommodating multimodal tuning curves and narrower peaks. The innovative model referred to as the semi Markov model (MSMM) explicitly depicts the correlation between the target position and movement direction angle relative to cursor position, in BCIs. 
The paper is nicely crafted with an concise discussion of the background information as well as the methodology and outcomes presented by the authors. The introduction does a job, in outlining the current advancements in iBCIs and justifies the requirement for a fresh perspective. The methodology part is thorough and well laid out with a description of the MSSM model and its various elements. 
The results section gives an assessment of the MSSM model by showcasing offline tests using recorded neural data and live clinical trials as well as displaying a notable enhancement compared to the Kalman filter in offline experiments and encouraging initial outcomes, in clinical trial tests.All charts and tables are neatly arranged to offer a depiction of the findings.
