This study introduces a submodular streaming method called STAR T that deals with maximizing a monotone submodular function while meeting a limit on the number of elements in a streaming scenario where some elements may be removed later on. The method goes through the data once. Stores a small group of elements, in memory to handle potential removals of a maximum of m elements effectively. Additionally the authors present a greedy approach named STAR T GREEDY to operate on the remaining elements post removal and ensure a consistent approximation guarantee. 
The article is nicely written with an concise introduction to the issue and their method, by the authors.The technical parts are detailed. The analysis is well founded.The practical results show how well the suggested algorithm performs in two data summarization tasks by surpass existing greedy and streaming techniques. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
A new way of dividing data and using a rule that gradually reduces thresholds has been suggested in order to ensure the algorithm provides results, with a certain level of accuracy. 
 Providing an evaluation of how well the algorithm performs and demonstrating its reliability through an assurance of the accuracy guarantee. 
The algorithms performance is showcased in real world scenarios with findings, from two distinct datasets. 
The paper has some drawbacks, such, as; 
The idea that the submodular function is always normalized and monotone may not hold true in real world scenarios at all times. 
In some cases it might not be possible to go through the data once as needed. 
The absence of a comparison, with other effective submodular optimization algorithms hinders an evaluation of how well the proposed algorithm performs in various scenarios.
