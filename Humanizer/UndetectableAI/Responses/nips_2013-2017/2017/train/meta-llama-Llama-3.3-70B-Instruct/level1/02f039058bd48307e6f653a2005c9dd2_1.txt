This research introduces a method for testing Conditional Independence (CI) among continuous random variables without using specific parameters by transforming the issue into a binary classification challenge instead. The authors present a technique called nearest neighbour bootstrap to create sets of data resembling the independent distribution and enabling the utilization of robust classifiers such as gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. The study offers assurances regarding the generated data sets and bounds for generalization in classifying problems with, near independent non i.i.d samples. 
The paper is nicely. The authors give a straightforward introduction to the issue of CI testing and its importance in different statistical and learning scenarios. The new method they suggest is original. Using binary classification to tackle the CI testing challenge is quite smart. The theoretical findings like Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 lay a groundwork, for their proposed approach. 
The practical assessment of the CCIT algorithm demonstrates encouraging outcomes by surpassng top performing algorithms such as KCIT and RCIT in various synthetic and real world tests.The outcomes obtained from examining the flow cytometry dataset are notably remarkable as they showcase how effective CCIT is in confirming CI relationships, within an environment.
