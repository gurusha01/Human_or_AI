This research introduces a first order approach for optimizing geodesically convex problems, on Riemannian manifolds – an extension of Nesterovs accelerated gradient descent method to non linear Riemannian settings. The authors establish two equations. Define two nonlinear operators for geodesically convex optimization while offering a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of their accelerated algorithms globally. Furthermore... 
The paper is nicely. Structured with a clear and detailed description of the methodology and results by the authors.They discuss how their work ties back to research on geodesically convex optimization like in [reference 21] while also highlighting the distinctions and commonalities between their approach and other methods, in a comprehensive manner. 
The papers strong points are; 
The writers introduce an effective technique for optimizing geodesically convex functions, on Riemannian manifolds that enhances the speed of convergence compared to current approaches. 
The research thoroughly. Explains how the algorithm progresses towards convergence by discussing its global convergence rate and the specific conditions that lead to its convergence. 
The writers outline a step by step approach, for solving matrix Karcher mean issues – a significant use of geodesically convex optimization. 
The paper has some shortcomings, such, as; 
The paper suggests that the convex function is typically smooth and strongly convex; however this may not hold true for every application. 
The article lacks a comparison with approaches, for geodesically convex optimization outlined in references [25 and [11].
The results, from the experiment only focus solelyon one particular use case, which's the matrix Karcher mean problems and do not offer a thorough assessment of the suggested algorithm. 
Reasons to consider; 
The research paper introduces an effective algorithm for optimizing geodesically convex functions, on Riemannian manifolds that enhances the speed of convergence compared to current approaches. 
The article offers an, in depth examination of how well the suggested algorithm merges together. 
The writers present a step by step approach, for solving matrix Karcher mean issues—a significant use of geodesically convex optimization. 
Reasons to oppose the proposal; 
The document suggests that the convex function is expected to be smooth and strongly convex; however this might not hold true in every scenario. 
The document lacks a comparison to established approaches, for geodesically convex optimization. 
The findings, from the experiment are confined to an use case and do not offer a thorough assessment of the suggested algorithm. 
In my opinion the paper should be accepted because it introduces an effective algorithm for geodesically convex optimization, on Riemannian manifolds and the authors have thoroughly analyzed the convergence properties of this algorithm in a detailed manner. However I suggest that the authors should work on improving some aspects of the paper like comparing it with methods currently available and testing the algorithm on a broader set of applications.
