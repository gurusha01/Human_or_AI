This study discusses how the decrease of eigenvalues affects function estimation through Gradient Descent (GD). It points out that GD might need iterations to estimate non smooth functions with kernels that are infinitely differentiable. The paper recommends employing second order techniques or explicit regularization to tackle this issue; however the former can be costly computationally while the latter introduces bias. As an approach the paper suggests Eigen Pro, as a method that accomplishes implicit regularization. 
The discovery that Gradient Descent (GD) is not effective for approximating smooth functions with infinitely differentiable kernels and its connection to the decay of the kernels eigenstructure are both new and thought provoking insights.The introduction of Eigen Pro as a solution that employs randomization to tackle computational obstacles shows promise, for practical applications. 
On the side though there are a couple of downsides worth mentioning here. For starters the conclusions drawn from the outcomes aren't very clear in terms of speeding up the process. When compared to PEGASOS there are only slight enhancements visible and Eigen Pro tends to run. While its praiseworthy that this approach can rival the effectiveness of cutting edge algorithms utilizing kernel methods direct evaluations are necessary to grasp the balance, between time efficiency and precision. It'd be helpful to incorporate findings from running a neural network. Like those in cutting edge methods. And juxtaposing them with kernel approximation, in a simulated scenario to deepen our grasp of these trade offs. 
The extended edition of the paper is nicely crafted; however; the draft that was turned in lacks readability clarity may be improved upon in that regard Overall the concept of the paper is solid but there is room for improvement, in clarifying the findings and enhancing readability
