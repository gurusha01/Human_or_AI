The article introduces a pair of methods for detecting and rectifying mistakes in sections of electron images utilized in the reconstruction of neural circuits by combining them strategically to enhance an initial segmentation in a step, by step manner. 
Contribution.
The method involves using two networks â€“ one that checks if a segment covering the central point of a region of interest (ROI )needs to be adjusted and another that predicts the accurate shape of the segment, around the central point.  
However when you focus on the corrections made and a segmentation measure such as VI for each pixel, in isolation a consensus issue arises for the volume. This aspect is not discussed in this paper. Instead a pragmatic approach outlined informally in Section 5. Relying on superpixel segmentation is used to gradually refine the initial segmentation. 
The practical implications of these findings for the connectomics field are clear; however  it is uncertain whether this greedy algorithm can be effectively used in areas, beyond connectomics.  
As a result of my evaluationI believe that this paper may not hold appeal, for the NIPS audience as a whole. 
**Introduction** 
The document is nicely organized and composed overall; however the technical parts, in sections 3 and 4 could use some improvement in terms of formality and clarity in explaining the algorithms.  
In the part and the comparison of previous studies should not emphasize the connection between complex problems and straightforward solutions too much since this idea is well known among computer experts, in the NP complexity groupings The argument that error identification task is presented more effectively than the supervoxel compilation task is also questioned. 
Lets take a look, at the existing literature.
The suggested approachs link to GAN technology and focus seems questionable and lacks substantive reasoning behind it; hence the citations to [5] [6] and [7]. If such relationships are meant for investigation or discourse purposes in the future and not as a current assertion, in the text itself.
