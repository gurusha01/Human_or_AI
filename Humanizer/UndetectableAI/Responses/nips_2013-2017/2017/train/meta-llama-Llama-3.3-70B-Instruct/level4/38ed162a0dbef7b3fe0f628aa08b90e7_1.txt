This study explores the traits of deep convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) focusing on their ability to remain mostly unchanged when subjected to various transformations and to maintain stability when exposed to diffeomorphisms â€“ as long as the patch extraction operator, kernel mapping operator and pooling operator are thoughtfully crafted. Additionally The authors show that given circumstances these advantageous features of CKNscan also be applied to convolution neural networks (CNN).
The paper is nicely organized and technically sound overall; however one drawback is the lack of experiments to support the theoretical conclusions made in it.It would be helpful to incorporate some outcomes demonstrating how CKNs stability, to changes and deformations is maintained with proper setup. 
Moreover it could be worth looking into methods like random projection or explicitly mapping kernels using a limited number of Fourier series to see if they might work well as solutions for approximating kernels successfully. If they do prove effective delving into how these techniques affect stability could offer an insight into the topic, in question providing a more thorough understanding overall.
