This study explores a technique for estimating the "inconsistency string kernel," as outlined by Leslie and colleagues in their paper (reference 17). This method evaluates the kernel dissimilarity between two strings by considering the matching k mers with a maximum of m discrepancies, between themL owing to the computational demands of the initial approach the authors suggest an alternative approximation method. 
The method has two parts; (1) figuring out the size of the neighborhoods with m mismatches for two sets of k mers and (2)determining how many pairs of k mers are within a distance of d, in terms of Hamming distance.To solve the issue the authors propose to pre calculate all neighbors with m mismatches by utilizing an algorithm that takes O(mÂ³).For the latter problem they use a technique called locality sensitive hashing. The suggested algorithm comes with assurances about the quality of the solution and estimates, on how it will take to run. 
The algorithm suggested in the study shows promising results in both real world scenarios by providing accurate calculations and enhanced performance levels for higher values of m. The research paper is well organized and easy to understand as it presents the algorithm methodically along, with evidence to support its effectiveness. 
MINOR REMARKS
The authors have noted that the suggested limit (referred to as Theorem 3;13) is quite broad, in scope.Is it difficult to refine this limit ? 
In Section 4 of the document there are a sentences that seem unfinished and might need some revisions to make them clearer, to the reader.
