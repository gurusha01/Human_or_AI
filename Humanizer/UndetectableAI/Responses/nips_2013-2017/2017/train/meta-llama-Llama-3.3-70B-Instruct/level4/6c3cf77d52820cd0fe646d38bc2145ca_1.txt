This study investigates how changing the transaction flooding protocol in the bitcoin network can help prevent deanonymization attacks that were possible in the protocol used before 2015. The researchers create models, for both the protocol (referred to as trickle) and its updated version (known as diffusion). They find that deanonymization can still be achieved with both protocols as supported by simulation based analyses of these models. 
Thoughts, on how the information was presented?
The paper is organized well. Effectively presents the essential background information although it does have some minor problems, like incomplete sentences and an unclear reference that needs to be resolved.The description of the transaction flooding protocols is detailed. Includes clearly articulated assumptions.

The writers mention a 30% chance of identifying participants in the study; although its a low percentage compared to others it holds importance nonetheless The core idea, behind de anonymizing is that a highly connected node needs to link with all operational bitcoin nodes to work effectively As the network expands in the future the feasibility of such a supernode accomplishing this task comes into doubt The authors make a valid argument when they discuss botnets as a potential opposing view 
While the paper provides an analysis of the topic at hand it does not definitively address whether trickle and diffusion protocols are equally effective in maintaining anonymity. Figure 6 highlights a probability difference (approximately 0 point 1) between the simulated trickle and diffusion protocols with diffusion showing lower performance. On the hand Figure 7 based on a real network snapshot illustrates diffusion performing better, than trickle. Although both approaches converge as more eavesdropper connections are made the discrepancies and conflicting results call for discussion. The claim that both methods show 'comparable detection odds’ needs explanation—especially regarding how the similarity is determined.
