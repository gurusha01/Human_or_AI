The research paper delves into kernel regression in scenarios with dimensions by initially examining the "additive model," which assumes f to be the sum of fp(X_p) thus overlooking correlations among various dimensions. Acknowledging the drawback of disregarding correlations leads the authors to propose the "group additive model," where dimensions are clustered together to capture their correlations. They establish a framework, for this scenario and present algorithms—although somewhat improvised—for identifying optimal groupings. These findings are showcased using synthetic and real world datasets. 
The paper raises concerns regarding its exploration of previous research efforts which hinders the ability to determine the uniqueness of the contributions made in it.The identification of optimal data groups intersects with fields such as " sparsity," and learning graphical models/Bayesian networks; however these connections remain unaddressed.Similarly the problem at hand can be seen as a form of feature selection. This aspect has not been discussed in detail.The section dedicated to works primarily focuses on a particular paper, from KDD 2015 [8] which falls short in providing an evaluation of the novelty presented in the paper. 
The theoretical concept seems fresh and innovative in nature. The writers introduce a complexity metric for clusters that gives preference to small clusters and is calculated as an upper limit on the cover count. Even though this metric is logical in nature the process of optimizing it is not simple which forces the authors to suggest either a search. Which doesn't scale well. Or a greedy approach similar to forward feature selection. Although enhancing functions can be quite tough, in general it's somewhat disappointing that they didn't come up with a measure that could be optimized more efficiently. The writers discuss exploring methods but do not offer additional details to help evaluate the appropriateness of their selected method. 
The paper introduces a synthetic validation experiment and demonstrates it using the Boston Housing dataset without comparing it to other methods, for reference purposes; this absence hinders the assessment of the results reliability. 
After responding to the critique raised against it and addressing some of the concerns mentioned in the feedback received far; the section detailing the experiments still lacks depth and fails to properly connect with larger ideas in machine learning discourse. Despite containing insights and receiving an enhanced score post revision; it is highly advisable for the authors to bolster their exploration of relevant research, in the final version published.
