This document aims to simulate user questions in a game of battleship by replacing queries about squares with inquiries framed in a made up language based on logical semantics (Montague inspired). The researchers use a log model that focuses on four simple aspects of the questions; expected information gain (how informative they are) type of response required (yes/no or numerical) and how relevant the question is, to the boards features. 
Looking at it broadly speaking the reason behind learning seems reasonable ; nevertheless the ideas put forth in this article are quite simple and the task is very basic, limited and lacks any real complexity. In my view this piece is probably not going to strike a chord, with the NIPS community because it might not bring anything new or insightful.
