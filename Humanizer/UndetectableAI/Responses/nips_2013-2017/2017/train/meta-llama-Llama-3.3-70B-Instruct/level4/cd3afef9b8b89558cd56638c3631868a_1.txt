This research paper delves into the topic of regression on linear sequences, in online environments.The authors mention that past studies have shown the challenges of learning isotonic regression in a completely adversarial framework.This leads them to suggest a practical random permutation model instead. 
While the paper is nicely written and presents a topic clearly overall despite a few typos and grammar errors here and there; however the arguments made lack proper support because experimental results were left out of consideration. To strengthen the credibility of the claims put forth in the paper it would be advantageous to run simulations using scenarios to showcase how isotonic regression can be beneficial for linear orders, in online settings.
