This research puts forward a method of using sampling to improve the multiclass classification technique described in [16]. It includes both explanations and practical evaluations of the methods effectiveness with experiments conducted on a textual dataset showcasing its capabilities in dealing with multiclass classification challenges involving numerous class categories. 
Advantages; 
The researchers conducted experiments comparing various standard methods and demonstrated that the new approach achieves excellent performance and requires less time for training, on various datasets. 
Exploring classification issues is a key area of study, with many real world uses. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The article extensively relies on reference [16] showcasing advancements in utilizing a dual sampling approach and developing generalization boundaries rooted in local Rademacher complexities; yet the originality of the study seems somewhat constrained. 
Though the method suggested cuts down on training time significantly it still results in prediction times when compared to alternative methods.There are instances, in real life situations where the prediction time holds importance as a key factor to consider. 
Here are some recommendations, for you; 
We need to clarify how the generalization bound in the paper is interpreted and compare it with existing approaches to understand its importance better. 
In comparing experiments between batch and online learning algorithms for evaluating the efficiency of the proposed methods memory requirements need to be taken into account due, to their differences.
