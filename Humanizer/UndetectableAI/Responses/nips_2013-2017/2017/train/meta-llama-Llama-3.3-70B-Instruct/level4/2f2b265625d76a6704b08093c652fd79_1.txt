This document delves into broadening the f GAN concept to f divergences by linking KL divergence with exponential families using the chi logarithmic approach.The authors introduce the information geometric f GAN (vig f GAN) equation and present a fresh perspective on the f GAN objective function function They also outline a criterion, for activation functions that result in generative distributions that are factored. 
The main theoretical advancement known as the vig f GAN identity is significant and shows potential for use; however presenting the core theorems, in broadly abstract forms makes understanding them quite challenging. 
Section 6 doesn't clearly link the results to the theoretical discoveries which makes it hard to understand their significance. 
On page seven, at line two hundred fifty eight of the document there is a sentence that reads "In equation seven it signifies when C..." that seems to have a mistake in its structure and could use some rephrasing to make it clearer.
