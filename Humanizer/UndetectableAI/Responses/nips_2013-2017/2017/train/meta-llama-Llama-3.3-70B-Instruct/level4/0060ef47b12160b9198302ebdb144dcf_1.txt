The document introduces a method using networks to create attention grabbing masks at a rapid pace for various images with impressive efficiency levels showcased in the process speed per second achieved by the system presented in the study. As I evaluate the documents content and approach taken in this study falls within an area where neither approving nor dismissing it completely would raise any significant concerns or objections. The idea of teaching a model to clarify its workings strikes a chord with me personally. The paper brings forward some insightful suggestions, towards this goal. 
After reviewing the content closely​​​. I didn't notice any mistakes​​​. However​​​ there are some clear boundaries​​​​. Specifically the method, for determining importance is not direct as it depends either​ on imprecise placement guidance or a suggested importance gauge, both of which come with their own restrictions that need to be addressed in the paper. 
Weakly supervised localization is not foolproof when an objects surroundings play a role in classifying it; pinpointing the object may not accurately reflect its significance level in the scenes context. While the outcomes of supervised localization are interesting, in nature they should be approached cautiously as a metric of saliency quality because of potential limitations. 
The suggested measure of importance also comes with its limitations due to how it is applied.The procedure of cropping the estimated area and then adjusting it back to the original image size while keeping the aspect ratio intact can lead to imperfections.To begin with variations in the aspect ratio might influence classification accuracy.Also the metrics inclination, towards important areas that are considerably magnified for re evaluation may not showcase the object to the classifier at an ideal scale. Considering that neural networks (CNNs] are usually insensitive to translation but need to learn for scale invariance purposes; it's probable that there are boundaries to their flexibility, in this aspect. 
One aspect that the paper didn't delve into is how much the effectiveness of the masking model is affected by the architecture employed for creating the masks. It would be helpful to understand whether the authors tested architectures and how these impacted the results. 
Some additional things to think about are clarifying if the findings mentioned in Table 1 apply to every category as a whole of just the accurate category and providing information on the exact type of LRP method and setup utilized for comparison purposes considering there are various versions (such as epsilon and alpha beta ), with customizable parameters. 
After the response is considered and analyzed further it's evident that the effectiveness of the saliency metric highly depends on the classifiers caliber and its ability to maintain consistency across scales thus considerably restricting the practicality of this method. This implies that the strategy can solely be implemented on networks that showcase consistency confining its usability, to particular situations. The key points to consider are that this method cannot be applied during the training phase of models or with models that do not have scale invariance capabilities – which restrict its usefulness across fields (, like CNN based spectrogram analysis). Additionally this contradicts the assertion that it can be generally applied to black box classifiers as indicated in the title. 
In addition to that point made in the reply highlights a reliance placed upon the masking network and prompts inquiries regarding whether the visibility of the U network or the masking network is being illustrated here clearly enough. If these constraints and associations are examined in detail within the document itself it might meet the criteria for being deemed balanced for publishing purposes. Failing that evaluation of discussion may lead to a suggestion, against publication.
