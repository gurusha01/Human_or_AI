This paper introduces a method for training gradient boosted regression tree ensembles that considers the impact of feature expenses and the evaluation costs of tree splits, in a model. The study shares some resemblances with the investigation carried out by Xu and colleagues back in 2012; however it differs significantly in terms of input characteristics and evaluation expenses. Additionally the evaluation cost fluctuates with the quantity of tree divisions. Employs a distinctive optimization approach derived from the Taylor expansion around T_{k. 1) As depicted in the XGBoost paper. Moreover it incorporates a first growth technique to extend trees up to a maximum split count rather than adherent, to a predetermined depth limit. The authors showcase how well their system performs in situations where either the cost of features or the cost of evaluation is paramount by backing up their assertions with findings. 

The paper is well organized and easy to understand even though it introduces a lot of notation that readers need to focus on.The contribution appears minor compared to the groundwork laid by XGBoost and GreedyMiser.The experimental part is thorough as it contrasts the approach with prior work and delves into how model parameters affect performance.A potential avenue, for investigation is indicated below which may require conducting an extra experiment. This model might catch the attention of professionals who work in situations where quick classification's key. 
Level technical assessment
An unclear issue comes up when looking at Figures 2a and 2b regarding how the cost's calculated for each technique in creating the Precision versus Cost curves. It seems that CEGB calculates costs based on inputs and splits individually while other methods evaluate costs per tree. This difference might lead to comparisons. To guarantee an assessment it would be advantageous to standardize the cost calculation, for all methods even if it differs from how costs were originally measured in their respective papers. Removing Figure 1 and instead including an analysis comparing the trees generated by CEGB (Contextual Bandits with Expert Advice) Greedy Miser algorithm (GM) and Budget Pruning method on the Yahoo Learning to Rank dataset could offer valuable insights into their performance distinctions. Furthermore clarifying the advancements made by CEGB over Greedy Miser through a comparison and providing a visual representation of the improvement in Precision vs Cost graph, with each innovation would enhance the papers credibility. Further clarification is needed on the difference, between evaluation and feature costs when considering how Greedy Miser and Budget Prune can be applied in practice. 

There are a few details that we should take a closer look, at. 
The reason for putting \lambda in front of the initial cost term, in equation 7 requires further explanation. 
Equation 13 appears to leave out a component involving the variable \lambda in the portions of the initial three terms. Much, like how it is presented in the XGBoost document. 
In Figure 4B the concept of "levels" is not clearly defined. 
Revising the definition of \beta_m at Line 205 and \alpha at Line 213 could improve clarity, for readers who might not instantly remember these definitions. 

The research paper introduces an approach to learning that is cost effective and has shown better performance than current methods in challenging environments previously deemed unsuitable for such methods; however there are concerns about accurately measuring costs and distinguishing between evaluation costs and feature costs which affect the evaluation of the study. Unless these uncertainties are clarified and resolved the paper may not meet the required standard for acceptance, at NIPS.
