This document introduces a method, for estimating gradients in Variational Bayes that shows no variation when the approximate distribution closely aligns with the actual distribution of hidden variables.The article is well organized and written in a manner; it could be approved with some minor edits. 
To improve our analysis further it would be helpful to explore situations where the variational distribution differs from the true distribution p(z|x). When this occurs the score functions expectation shifts from zero resulting in bias in our estimation method. Delving deeper into understanding the negative impacts of this bias would be quite valuable, for our work. 
In addition to the mixture ELBO mentioned on line 188 of the document it seems that there is a lack of a distribution for π₵. The manuscript does not clearly define z₵, which leads to uncertainties about its role in the mixture and how it affects reparameterization. To better grasp the proposed methodology further explanation, on these points is required.
