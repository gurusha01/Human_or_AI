This research study delves into exploring how clustering algorithms handle queries when additional data called 'side information' in the form of a similarity matrix W is added to them. The paper highlights a discovery. It sets a standard point where without additional details included in the search process results in a complexity of Theta(n*k). However when side information is included in the process it brings down this complexity to O(k multiplied by the logarithm of n divided by H squared ( f plus or minus || f )) with H representing the Hellinger distance between distributions compared.They also prove that this limitation is nearly precise, with a variation multiplied by n. 
The findings shared in this paper are thought provoking for reasons.The link to the block model (SBM) which has been of considerable interest lately suggests new insights, about how querying affects threshold behavior.An important observation is that including information can significantly change the complexity of queries.This discovery quantifies the idea that side information could fully represent cluster information,a concept that might seem intuitive but is rigorously examined here. The paper adds value by explaining how the accuracy of the similarity matrix impacts the complexity of queries and sheds light on the relationship, between additional information and the effectiveness of clustering.
