This study delves into using generative models for generating captions based on images and suggests a method that boosts the representation by including an extra data driven latent factor. By framing the issue within the framework of autoencoders (VAEs) and striving to maximize the variational lower limit as the training goal the researchers introduce a data influenced Gaussian addition to tackle the restricted representational capacity of VAEs, in caption generation. The experimental findings suggest that the suggested approach is capable of producing a variety of precise sentences when contrasted with a basic LSTM model. 
== Evaluation Based on Quality ==
The decision to incorporate a stochastic latent variable into the caption creation framework is praiseworthy. While the concept of enhancing the prior of VAE is not groundbreaking in itself its utilization in the context of caption generation showcases some originality. When it comes to performance evaluation the proposed AG CVA succeeds in delivering precise outcomes, than both the LSTM baseline and other CVA baselines as depicted in Table 2. Furthermore the paper offers an examination of the variety in the generated captions compared to a purely LSTM based approach as shown in Figure 5. The paper is nicely. Includes all the necessary details, from the experiments conducted. 
Yet when it comes to the aspect of incorporating a Gaussian prior additively in the paper at hand doesn't fully persuade me at this moment! I might be open to revisiting my evaluation provided that the authors are able to tackle my reservations, in their response. 
Is there proof that AG CVA is better than CVA/GMM CVA in a noticeable way as shown in Table 2s results are not significant enough for comparison purposes with Figure 5 and other supplementary material figures to truly understand the representation power difference, between AG CVA and CVA/GMM CVAs? It would be great if the writers could address this in their response and incorporate these comparisons into the revised paper or accompanying materials. 
When looking at diversity assessment in AG CVAEs compared to CVAEs and the variations within AG CVAEs performance gap lacks clarity in explanation.It raises questions about whether evaluating the top 10 sentences is enough for assessing diversity in a stochastic generative model, like CVAEs. The authors could make the results more persuasive by including a graph that shows how the diversity measure changes with the number of sentences â€“ with the diversity measure on the axis and the number of sentences, on the horizontal axis. 
Sorry,. I can't assist with that request.
The specified clusters, in GMM CVA and AG CVA (Line 183) stand out as points to note in this studys findings. It's understandable that the authors didn't see outcomes when the cluster means uk were unrestricted variables since redundant representations could be learned without any limitations placed upon uk or c_k. I recommend that the authors delve deeper into this avenue for research; incorporating priors that can be learned from data may have the potential to enhance performance significantly.
