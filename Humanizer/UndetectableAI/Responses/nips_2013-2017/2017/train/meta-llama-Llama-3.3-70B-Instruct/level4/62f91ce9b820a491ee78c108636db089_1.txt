UPDATE. Thank you for your reply; I have carefully examined it.  
Initially I overlooked the fact that the experiments didn't directly follow the method for which theoretical results were providedâ€”it caused me to lower my score by one level. 
This paper is impressive. Detailed and well written with solid theoretical findings on deterministic quadrature options instead of random Fourier features presented in a compelling manner.I have some ideas for improvement. Overall I think it would make a great addition, to NIPS. 
I have doubts about the assessment of QMC mentioned in page 2 lines 72 to 74. Was an advanced QMC technique used in the study that was referred to ? Is there a reason to believe that no QMC method could outperform the suggested approach ? I am interested in exploring the application of higher order digital nets in QMC, which are linked to weighted RKHS and bear resemblance, to the ANOVA framework discussed in Dick and Pillichshammers book from 2010.
Remember to use the "\top" command, for transposing in LaTeX. 
It would be good to explain what the Cartesian basis e_i means before using it for the time. 
In the content between line 151 and 155 of page 4 of the document refers to comparing the result with the RFF method and hints at additional assumptions being considered that could affect the performance comparison between them. The suggestion is to delve into how these assumptions impact the superiority of the proposed method, over RFF in light of these added conditions mentioned in the paper. 
Can you define the symbol \(\tilde{\Omega}\) in section 4 please?
