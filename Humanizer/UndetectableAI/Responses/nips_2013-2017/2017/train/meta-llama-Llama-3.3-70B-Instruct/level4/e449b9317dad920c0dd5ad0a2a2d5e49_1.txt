This paper introduces a method for examining calcium imaging data with the goal of extracting timecourses and spatial filters of cells—a key aspect in neuroscience where improved algorithms to reduce interference would be very useful.The suggested approach is similar to the CNMF technique. Stands out due, to its use of a strong loss function.However I don't have the knowledge to assess the originality and statistical soundness of this method entirely; hence my feedback will concentrate on its real world implementation. 
There is an issue indicated by Fig 2d that raises some concern regarding the diminishing accuracy of estimates over iterations in the studys findings. The problem appears to be linked to the algorithms setup using actual cell locations rather than simulating real world conditions as detailed in the paper. This methodology adds complexity to evaluating the performance of the EXTRACT algorithm, against CNMF or ICA. Makes it harder to support the assertion of enhanced performance. 
There are a few points to take into account that are worth mentioning.
Line 47 discusses how the absence of signals in calcium imaging data is due to the tight control of calcium levels, in neurons – where there is initially very little free calcium that rises markedly when voltage gated ion channels are activated – rather than the source of the signals being photons. 
Using a Poisson distribution to simulate data and consider photon shot noise, in fluorescence imaging could provide an accurate portrayal of the data and improve the credibility and usefulness of the suggested technique.
