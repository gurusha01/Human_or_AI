This paper suggests a method by introducing a new operator instead of the usual convolutional filter process that usually includes matrix multiplication calculations.The approach involves measuring the angle similarity between filter weights and pixel values (or activation values in, between layers) in hypersphere space than evaluating their resemblance through inner product computations.Additionally the authors outline three operator functions based on this angle measurement; linear,cosine and sigmoid. The authors adjusted the regularization term and loss function to fit the operations requirements successfullyâ€”the ablation study proving the effectiveness of each addition and enhancing performance in image classification tasks, with CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets and image feature embedding tasks showing improved accuracy and quicker training convergence. 
The paper showcases theoretical depth with a well defined structure and thoughtful experiments presented in an elegant writing style.  
Nevertheless a drawback of the research is that it did not test on practical image classification tasks like ImageNet without explaining why or hinting at possible future studies, in this area. Furthermore looking into how this method could be used for tasks beyond what has been done so far. Like small scale reinforcement learning issues. Might be worth exploring further.
