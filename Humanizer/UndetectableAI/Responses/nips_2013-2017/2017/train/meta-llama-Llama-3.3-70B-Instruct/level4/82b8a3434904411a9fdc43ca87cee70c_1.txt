This document discusses how to reduce variability in situations where single instances could undergo changes like image rotations and noise inclusion.This new method expands upon the MISO/Finito system by using a replacement function for each changed example that shows a progression of quadratic lower limits.However due to the inclusion of permutations these lower limits are not exact as they are unique to the existing permutation of being reflective of the average value, across all permutations. The writers show that their algorithms speed of reaching a solution is distinct from SGD because it relies on the variability related to permutations (σρ) particularly at the best possible outcome point – as opposed to the complete variability that includes both example sampling induced variability and overall variance in general terms The paper wraps up with a convincing set of practical outcomes, from experiments. 
While the algorithm may seem gradual in its progressions​ ​the issue, at hand holds great importance​ ​the method used is easy to grasp​ and the results are thorough​​ offering strong support through both theoretical analysis and practical experimentation. 
One critique revolves around the way things are visually presented in the chart. The font sizes in the legend are too small which makes it hard to read; the yellow line is too bright. Doesn't stand out enough against the white background; and each line is identified only by its color without any symbols or dashes to differentiate them which can make it tricky or even impossible to distinguish them in black and white.
