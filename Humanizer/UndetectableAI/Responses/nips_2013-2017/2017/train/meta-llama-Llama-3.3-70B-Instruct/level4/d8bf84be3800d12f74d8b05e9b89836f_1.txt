This document improves the PointNet [19) system by adding a strategy that allows the model to grasp the surrounding context, on various scales as it progresses.  
The presentation is nicely. The mathematical concepts are easy to understand.  
The results from the experiment show that PointNet++ performs better than methods, on point set tests and achieves top notch performance.  
Nevertheless the experimental results do not provide validation, for employing PointNet++ to regain local intricacies.
In terms and considering the evidence presented in the research paper such as the thoughtfully designed experiments and comparative results, against existing top methods that highlight the models exceptional performance I lean towards suggesting approval.
