This document introduces a method for creating network embeddings without supervision. The main achievements of this study include; a.) Creating a function based on matrix tri factorization that maintains both local proximity and overall node ranking in the graph effectively; b.) Offering theoretical foundations, for the developed objective function; and c.) Assessing embeddings obtained from optimizing the objective function using neural networks across three real datasets and various data analysis tasks. 
Advantages; 
The document showcases theoretical foundations and provides a thorough explanation of the loss function in terms of maintaining proximity and overall ranking. 
The results from the experiment show performance, on all tasks and datasets. 
Areas to improve upon; 
The paper devotes much attention to theoretical explanations while neglecting practical discussions; certain lemmas such, as Lemma 3 (found in Section 3 of the manuscript) could be simplified or left out for brevity. 
Lines 169 to 184 seem to go off track from the goal since maximizing modularity is just a specific instance of equation (9) with alpha as 1 â€“ but it doesn't play a part in the ultimate loss function so its not really essential, to the central structure. 
It appears simple to integrate node ranking details into the system by including an extra goal similar to what the authors did in their study. Even though the test outcomes demonstrated an improvement, in performance as a result of this inclusion. 
In the section of the write up some areas need improvement such as organizing the results based on various evaluation criteria separately and possibly including another baseline approach like GCNs (Graph Convolution Networks) by Kip and Welling, from ICLR 2017 which is known for its effective node embedding learning technique.
