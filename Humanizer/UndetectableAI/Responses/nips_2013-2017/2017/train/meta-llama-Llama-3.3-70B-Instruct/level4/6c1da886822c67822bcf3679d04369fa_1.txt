This study is really well written. Offers a clear summary of the latest techniques in density modeling.The authors show that autoregressive models and other methods like normalizing flows and Real NVP/NICE can be better understood when looked at together.Some parts of this viewpoint have been discussed before in works like Kingma et al.' paper, on IAF. This document provides a more detailed and easy to follow analysis of how these models and techniques are related. Expanding upon this groundwork laid out by the authors is a variation that has shown great potential with results that rival or even outperform current cutting edge methods.
