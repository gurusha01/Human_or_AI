The document suggests using a Bayesian network strategy to reduce mistakes in iBCl decoders and allow the system to make use of longer signal histories while reducing errors.  
The latest advanced technique seems to depend on Kalman filters, for interpreting brain signals to figure out the direction of movement.The researchers showcase a betterment of this method by using a tuning curve and a revised Kalman filter system. 
In order to provide clarity, on the approach used here it would be useful to establish the shortest recording duration needed to set up both the tuning curve and the decoder. 
The writers mention that the decoders state includes not the desired cursor movement vector as seen in the standard Kalman filter but also the final two dimensional location on the screen where the user plans to shift the cursor to.This brings up queries about whether knowing the goal beforehand's essential and hints at a potential need, for a supervised method.If this turns out to be true the authors ought to recognize this restriction to offer a complete grasp of how their approach can be used and its limitations.
