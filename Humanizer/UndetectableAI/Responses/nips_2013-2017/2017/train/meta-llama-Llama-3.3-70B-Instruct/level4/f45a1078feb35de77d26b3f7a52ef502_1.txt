This article introduces a method for estimating point process intensity or hazard using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (GAN). It discusses the advantages of looking into functions other than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and puts forth a computationally efficient distance metric approach.The technique involves a regulated form for optimization and relies on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) both as generators and discriminators.However the explanation of the methodologies and data utilized in real world analyses seems incomplete. Could benefit from further details to improve reproducibility, in research settings. 
The test outcomes indicate that the WGANTPP method suggested performs well on assignments by utilizing both simulated and real data sets; however the comparison models used appear too basic in nature. For example the kernel mixture process is confined to 3 elements leading to insufficient representations and the self triggered and self adjustment processes depend on set baselines ignoring the vast research, on semi parametric hazard functions. To enhance the analysis further and make it more robust and adaptable to varying scenarios and contexts as described in the works of Gouldin (, from ICDN 2016) Weiss (presented at ECML in 2013) and Jing (covered in WSDN 2017).
The established way to measure distance might struggle with handling interference caused by incidents especially when the ith element aligns with the ith element of every sequence directly.A distance measure that focuses on alignment could potentially be stronger and sturdier compared to the one currently suggested.Clarity, on the situations where this distance measure is supposed to perform better than log likelihood would be advantageous. 
In Equation 3 of the document needs a correction in the summation to \sum{j=i+ 12}(y_{ j }). Moreover in Section 3 where inhomogeneous processes are discussed there appears to be an error with \alpha and c being interchanged mistakenly. Lastly some minor spelling mistakes, like "need fixing to maintain the manuscripts quality.
