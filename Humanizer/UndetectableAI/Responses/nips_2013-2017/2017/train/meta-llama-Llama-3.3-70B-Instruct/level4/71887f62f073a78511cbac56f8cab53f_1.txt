This document combines strategies from extensive optimization methods such, as smoothing techniques and acceleration to tackle a problem related to three convex functions and a linear operator expressed as f(x)+g(x)+h(A*x) where the smoothness of f is a defining characteristic The authors utilize a smoothing method inspired by Nesterov [reference] to refine the term h(A*x) then proceed with a block forward backward splitting approach. The approach involves updating a chosen block during each step of the process while also integrating acceleration and homotopy methods to speed up the convergence of the algorithm effectively The algorithm mainly functions as a primal technique utilizing proximal gradient, on the smoothed function.  
The results from the tests in the paper showcase how effective the new algorithm is when compared to other methods already, in use.
