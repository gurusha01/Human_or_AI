The researchers suggest a method that uses Fourier features to measure the distance between the phase functions of probability distributions in line with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and its kernel function conceptually linked to it. This approach based on phase functions allows for the development of a test to compare distributions impacted by additional noise when some properties of the noise distribution are known like the positivity of its characteristic function. MoreoverÂ¸ phase characteristics can be useful, in studying from samples organized into labeled groups called bags. The researchers use their method on sets of data to evaluate non parametric tests for two samples. 
The methodology presented in the paper seems solid as it deals with issues involving complex structures that are difficult to handle using traditional approaches. It seems like the technique serves as a way to fix errors in measurements that have been affected by a kind of interference. To better showcase its efficiency and reliability in real world scenarios it would be helpful to test this method with data sources related to signal decoding challenges, like those found in mobile or satellite communication systems, which could offer a practical and reliable testing ground. 
However in this method the situations being taken advantage of may need scrutiny or adjustment such as in the instance of random variables that cannot be decomposed into simpler parts since confirming these situations can be even more difficult, than the issue highlighted by the authors.
