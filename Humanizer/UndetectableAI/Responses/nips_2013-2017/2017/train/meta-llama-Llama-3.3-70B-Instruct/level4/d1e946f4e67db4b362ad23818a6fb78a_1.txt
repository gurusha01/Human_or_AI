This study presents a method called Multiplicative Update Graph Matching (MPGM) which utilizes a multiplicative update strategy for solving the general Quadratic Programming issue efficiently and effectively. One significant benefit of this approach is that it provides solutions for the update iterations while guaranteeing convergence and integrating doubly stochastic constraints directly into the optimization procedureâ€”an aspect that sets it apart from current methods, in the field. 
The papers technical components are strong. Backed by both theoretical and experimental evidence that effectively back up the arguments presented in a clear manner, with well thought out structure aiding in its coherence. 
From a standpoint and without diving too deeply into the details of graph matching research papers the suggested approach seems original.The qualitative and quantitative findings presented indicate an improvement, over existing cutting edge techniques. 
Considering that matching graphs presents an acknowledged challenge, in the field of algorithms development and achieving guaranteed convergence stands out as a notable achievement that emphasizes the significant implications of this research effort.
