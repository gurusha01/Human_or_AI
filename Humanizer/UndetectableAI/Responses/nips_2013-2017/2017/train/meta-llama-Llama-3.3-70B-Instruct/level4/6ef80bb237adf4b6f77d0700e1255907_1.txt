This paper introduces a theoretical breakthrough by expanding Nesterovs approach to tackle geodesically convex problems on Riemannian manifolds and shows that this extension is viable.The analysis of metrics for the Karcher mean problem stands out as a fascinating aspect of the research and highlights the significance of this contribution, to the area.
