General Overview; 
I find the suggested method interesting as it shows promising outcomes with focus maps indicating that the enhancements might be due to better attention mechanisms rather than just a larger model size; however there is room for improvement, in the writing style which at times seems lacking and unclear though I think the authors could enhance their work with more time. 
Advantages; 
"The innovation of the model has led to achievements."
The tests conducted were extensive. Carefully carried out in terms of quality and quantity. 
I find the way they switch between attention mechanisms quite fascinating. From unary to pairwise and then to final attention mechanisms! Nonetheless it would have been nice to see some marginalized attention maps included as well; maybe I missed them in the text or supplementary materials. 
Areas needing improvement; 
The writing and presentation seem a bit scattered at times as previously noted. 
The uniqueness of the method appears to be restricted since the increased intricacy. While surpassing the MCB for VQA model [reference 07] primarily relies on the insight provided by [reference 07]s ideas at varying levels of complexity and sophistication levels. Though not a concern per se (not a big deal) I suggest that the authors elucidate their contributions further to prevent any inadvertent omissions, in understanding and acknowledgment. 
The link between probability is not clearly defined yet; the way its presented seems like an inspiration rather than something definite, in nature right now.I recommend that the authors either offer a precise explanation or use language that better fits its informal nature. 
Figure 2 seems a bit abstract and hard to understand in terms of how the network works. I suggest simplifying the figure to highlight the generation of potentials as well, as pairwise and trinary potentials more clearly. 
I was puzzled by the fact that Figure 3 was not mentioned in the text. 
Topics I'm interested, in; 
I'm interested in the values learned for the coefficients, in equations (number 2) which are used to combine marginalized potentials don't you think it'd be intriguing to see how various modalities make use of different potential orders?
Despite the similarities in architecture between the 2‐Modalities Unary + Pairwise model and MCB [7] the formers underperformance raises questions that are not adequately addressed in the text—specifically concerning its connection to the decision computation modules switch from MCB, to MCT. 
The debate on whether to utilize a series of MCB as opposed to a MCF layer, for the decision making component is intriguing; however there seems to be a dearth of evidence to back it up.Please could the authors kindly provide their discoveries or perspectives on this matter?
