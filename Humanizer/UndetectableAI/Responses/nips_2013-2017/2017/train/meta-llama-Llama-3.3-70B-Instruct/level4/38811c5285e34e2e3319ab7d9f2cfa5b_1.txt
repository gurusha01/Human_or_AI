This study introduces an approach to parallel machine learning algorithms that emphasizes enhancing the integration of base learners through advanced techniques instead of basic averaging methods The strategy includes substituting select hypothesis subsets with their Radon point coordinates and includes complexity limitations and practical evaluations against parallel algorithms in Spark and fundamental linear models, in Weka. 
The idea of using a black box approach to merge learners is quite interesting as it presents a different option from the conventional bagging methods.The study on the complexity of the Radon machine makes an impact by showing that dividing the initial samples into smaller segments leads to a more effective parallel machine compared to a basic learner working on the complete sample set.Also worth mentioning is the authors introduction of a PAC limit, on the Radon machine which bolsters the basis of the research paper. 
Nevertheless there is an issue regarding how useful the suggested method can be, in real world scenarios especially when dealing with large amounts of data. The tests seem to have been carried out on datasets (containing just 18 attributes) which might not capture the intricacies of current machine learning challenges accurately. To improve the credibility of the paper it would be beneficial for the authors to explain how their approach can handle dimensional datasets effectively as this would greatly enhance the papers overall quality.
