This paper presents two versions of the SMDP UCRL algorithm called FSUCRL version 1 and FSUCRL version 2 and studies how they perform in terms of behavior.This is the difference, between these variants and the original SUCRL algorithm – while the original one needs prior knowledge of certain parameters linked to option behavior the new approaches calculate these parameters based on data analysis directly. The key distinction between FSUCRL v1 and FSUCRL v2 is how they handle parameter estimation – one version directly estimates parameters along with their confidence intervals while the other uses a procedure for deriving these parameters indirectly instead of explicitly stating them upfront like SUCRL does in its regret bounds calculation with an added expense due to estimation of parameters and supporting empirical evidence, for validation of these approaches also included. 
The paper is well crafted overall; however certain parts may seem dense due to the content involved in the studys subject matter.The key idea driving this research is the use of Markov chain models for options.The primary contribution lies in Theorem 1. It would be helpful to provide a more intuitive explanation of its proof, within the main text of the paper instead of placing it in an appendix.This approach would improve readers comprehension of the findings.
