The writers suggest a flexible importance sampling technique that guarantees "safety" for coordinate descent and stochastic methods by using lower and upper bounds on gradient values to estimate gradient based sampling effectively This method is proven to be the best theoretically based on these boundaries and performs better, than uniform or fixed importance sampling methods It can be calculated with minimal extra cost Although adaptive importance sampling has been studied before the authors introduce a unique convex optimization approach to choose the best sampling distribution and offer an efficient algorithm for solving it. 
This paper is excellently. Makes a significant impact in advancing importance sampling methods, within the field. 
Sure thing! Here is the paraphrased text; 
It seems like there is a mistake, in the proof of Lemma 2.. The calculation of alpha may be missing a factor of 2.  
In Example 3A point 10 is to maximize a value of uniform sampling to improve results at the upper or lower bounds as opposed to taking a naive approach which may not be the best strategy. 
In relation to Algorithm 4;, in line 4 when m is defined as the value of the sorted list \(l\) it is uncertain if this requirement will ever be fulfilled. Moreover; on line 7 it appears that \(u\) sorted should be utilized of \(c\) sorted. 
In order to enhance the accuracy of the data findings referencing and evaluating adaptive sampling methods like the ones mentioned in citations [1] [4] and [20] along, with fixed importance sampling using non uniform distributions can be advantageous.  
It is quite noticeable that timing results, for SGD are missing and should be looked into. 
The title of the paper mentioned in reference [14} is wrong. Needs to be fixed. 
Furthermore don't forget to add "Importance Sampling for Minibatches " a work, by Csiba and Richtarik that can be found on arxiv from the year 2016 in your reference list. 
I have analyzed your text. Noticed that the AI text detector uses various methods, like heuristics and perplexity to distinguish between machine generated and human written text. By examining part of speech distribution statistics and common patterns of AI generated text it determines the origin of the text.
Respond with a rebuttal.
I'm sorry. I cannot provide a response, without the input text. Please provide the text you'd like me to paraphrase.
After carefully considering the authorsâ€™ rebuttal and the detailed responses they provided to my feedback and inquiries I am convinced that this paper should be accepted.
