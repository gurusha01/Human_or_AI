This paper presents a Gaussian process covariance function for multiple outputs in the spectral domainâ€”a significant advancement in Gaussian processes that has not received much attention before now.The authors expand on research highlighted in reference [1] and broaden its application to the scenario with multiple outputs by tackling the issue of cross covariance description without the need for positive definiteness.Their innovative method results in the creation of a combination covariance for Gaussian processes, with multiple outputs. 
The paper is nicely. Presents a succinct and lucid introduction to the issue and basics of Gaussian processes.The detailed discussion of the mixture kernel is comprehensive and the new additions suggested appear to be unique, in my understanding.The authors successfully place their study in the context of research papers hinting at enough originality to justify publication. 
The experimental evaluation may not offer intuitive insights but is considered satisfactory for a paper like this one especially when looking at the Jura dataset.The empirical results included back up the effectiveness of the proposed method. I think the experimental assessment is appropriate for a paper concentrating on theoretical advancements.In general the paper introduces a progress, in Gaussian process research and its publication is well founded.
