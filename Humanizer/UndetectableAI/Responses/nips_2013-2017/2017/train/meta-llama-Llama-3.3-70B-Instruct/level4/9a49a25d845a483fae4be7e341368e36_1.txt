This study suggests an approach to transform data sets to ensure fairness for both groups and individuals by framing it as a convex optimization challenge with certain conditions in place.The researchers provide estimates of generalization errors based on usefulness and group equity. Showcase the effectiveness of the framework, through practical trials. 
The introduction doesn't effectively communicate the contributions of the paper; it should explicitly outline them for improved clarity. 
Proposition 1s concept of convexity seems understandable on a theoretical level at first glance It would be helpful to delve deeper into how convexity influences the balance between utility and fairness, for both groups and individuals. 
Proposition 2 might be misleading because it overlooks the factor $ m $ while using the big O notation method incorrectly. The accurate limits should be $ O(\sqrt { m \log ( Ãà Ã®  ÃÅ + n/m ) /. \Log ( Ãà /Œ≤ ) / n }) $. The initial component, inside the root indicates the complexity aspect since $ m $ represents the size of the learning transformation parameter.For example if the non discrimination attribute is represented as a vector of dimension $ùëë$ then there must be at least $2^{ùëë}$ samples to reach a stable bound that grows exponentially based on $ùëë$. In terms of sample complexity the existing framework falls short in terms of its ability to learn. 
The comparison between the suggested approach and LFR is not entirely fair since LFR allows adjustments to be made to balance utility against group and individual fairness through its parameters. It's crucial to tune these parameters properly and conduct experiments using smaller increments of $\epsilon$. The experiments provided do not convincingly demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to manage the balance, between utility and fairness. Additionally‚Äã the authors need to‚Äã evaluate their approach against LFR with regard to fairness, on a level since there is no proof yet that the suggested method guarantees fairness at the individual level. 
The current form of the contribution seems to lack significance, in both theoretical and experimental aspects. 
After the debate on the topic and further evaluation of the document I have grown more favorable, towards it resulting in a rating.
