The research delves into the challenge of selecting a group of items labeled as T from a set E in a streaming scenario with the goal of guarantee that even after taking out any m elements, from T,a subset S of sizek can always be obtained while maximizing a submodular function f.  
This issue has practical uses since enhancing submodular functions is a topic that has been extensively investigated with established streaming techniques, in place already. 
The writers introduce an algorithm that provides an estimate, for this issue by producing a collection T of size (mlog k + k ) log squared k. 
After reviewing the paper it seems that the findings are technically robust. The solution put forth is complex with both the algorithm and analysis presenting technical hurdles. Nevertheless my main issue pertains to the papers alignment with the conference. The reasons and practical uses outlined appear lacking in strength and the issue itself might not have broad relevance casting doubt on its suitability, for this event.
