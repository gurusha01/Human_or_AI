This study introduces a method for inferring likelihood, without direct observation using an innovative variational inference technique inspired by Hierarchical Variational Inference and Implicit Variational Bayes methods. The key idea involves adjusting the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) represented in equation 4 by subtractinig the logarithm of the distribution log q(x_n). This adjustment highlights the importance of estimating log density ratios for likelihood variational inference. The approachs specifics are based on methods such as calculating log density ratios and using reparametrization, alongside hierarchical variational distributions. 
The approach to tackling the complexity of likelihood in dimensional spaces is interesting but requires estimating the log density ratio in the combined space of data xn and latent variable zn which presents challenges due, to the difficulty of high dimensional log density ratio estimation and lacks a clear indication of a reliable algorithm to address this obstacle. It is interesting to see how the authors chose to use their approach with a Bayesian GAN for classifying data instead of a typical GAN for creating complex visuals such as images. The issue of maintaining stability in this algorithm is a cause for concern. The initial "variational joint" being significantly different, from the " joint" could make it challenging to accurately estimate log density ratios and could result in biased gradients during the crucial early stages of optimization.
