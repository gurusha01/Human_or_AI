The research paper introduces a method for managing false discovery rates associated with statistical significance (p values). It involves linking each hypothesis to both a probability value (pi) and a set of features (Xi). The technique determines a threshold, for each hypothesis based on its feature vector X_iâ€”an intriguing and original idea. The article is explained clearly overall. The authors show how effective their approach is in both simulated and real life scenarios by proving that it can boost rejections while maintaining control over the false discovery ratio, with the help of extra details. 
One important thing to keep in mind is that using feature vectors Xi to calculate p values pi can lead to circularity problems and should be avoided. While the authors briefly mention this in an example scenario they fail to discuss the probabilistic connection, between Xi and pi. It seems probable that both pi and Xi rely on whether or not the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesiss valid. However if Xi has already been utilized in determining pi it should not enhance the decision boundary. 
The authors argue that dismissing parametric methods because of the complexity of X may not be completely persuasive.. Take nearest neighbors regression as an example; it can adjust to the dimension of the regression function even in cases where X has a high dimensionality. 
The reliability of the suggested validation method in avoiding overfitting remains uncertain in this context differs from traditional supervised learning since the exact "label'' FDR is not identified and it is substituted by an estimator instead authors should highlight and expand on this aspect since the imprecise estimation of FDR could lead to a higher FDR for the test dataset despite Theorem 1 offering a limit that increases as the number of folds, in cross validation grows this matter requires additional scrutiny. 
The mirror estimator suggested by the authors might show bias but increased variability if t(x)s value is low since there are only a few p values that lie between 1 t(x). This issue is similar to Storys method where lambda is selected to strike a balance between bias and variance by estimating the proportion, within [lambda,1].
I have made some adjustments.
I'm sorry. I can't generate a response without the input text, from the user. If you provide me with the text I'll be able to paraphrase it for you.
Line 136 should be replaced with "these" of "this."
