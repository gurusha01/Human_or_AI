This study delves into the idea of enhancement through a set of A/B trials and suggests a different method involving adaptive testing, like the multi arm bandit dilemma while ensuring control over the rate of false discoveries persists unrestrained despite being extensively debated in statistical writings.  
The suggested method outlined in this paper seems to tackle the challenges quite well overall. Despite a minor points worth mentioning later on this paper is engaging and could open up new paths, for further research. 
Between lines 24 and 37 of the text discussed well known problems that could benefit from including references for support in claims made by the authors.In their analysis predominantly centered around the field of computer science and machine learning (CS/ML) it is worth noting that a significant amount of research in biometrics is also applicable, to the discussion.One example is the examination conducted by Villar et al., which was published in Statistical Science in 2015.Other publications referencing this survey further contribute to the topic at hand. 
In line 37 of the document,'testing literature' should be revised to 'multiple literature testing.' 
Lines 38 to 47 present a notion to "platform trials' in biometrics prompting the authors to expand on the distinctions of their concept, from this established notion. 
Minor adjustments are required in the following instances; in line 112,"and. Should be changed to just "and"; in line 115,"LUCB" needs to be accompanied by a reference and description;"samplesas" in line 153 should be revised to "samples, as"; and for clarity the phrase "are ran" in line 260 needs further explanation. 
The mention of "truncation time" at line 273 lacks clarity. Requires additional elaboration due to its notable influence, on the outcomes depicted in Figure 2. 
The motivation mentioned in lines 288 to 291 appears misplaced within the papers context.I suggest integrating this motivation into the introduction section along with the discussions on website management and clinical trials, for coherence.
