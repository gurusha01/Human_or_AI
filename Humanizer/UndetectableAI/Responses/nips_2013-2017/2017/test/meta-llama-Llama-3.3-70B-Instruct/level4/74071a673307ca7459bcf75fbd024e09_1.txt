The writers suggest a screening guideline to detect block formations, in the Isign model. Suggest combining it with precise or approximate optimization techniques to facilitate scalable parameter estimation process that follows certain observations I have made about this strategy; 
You could also use clustering or regularized spectral clustering to identify the block structure and then proceed with exact or approximate optimization techniques for further analysis purposes. It would be helpful to compare the suggested screening method with decomposition, on a graph Laplacian to evaluate how well it works and differentiate it from other approaches currently available. 
The second screening rule introduced in this paper shares similarities with screening rules put forth in works by Witten et al (2011) and Mazumder & Hastie (2012). A thorough examination of how our approach aligns with or diverges from established methods, in the field could offer insights and context. 
The durability of breaking down $\theta $ into blocks raises some doubts since the initial screening rule might result in incorrect parameter determination if the real $\theta $ doesn't follow a block format accurately. It would be valuable to test how well the suggested approach works in situations to determine its dependability and any possible drawbacks.
