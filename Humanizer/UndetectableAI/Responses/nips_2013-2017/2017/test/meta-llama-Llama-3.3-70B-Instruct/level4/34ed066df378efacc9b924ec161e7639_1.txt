Review Synopsis; 
This document introduces a design, for creating pictures of people by blending the look of a person from one image with a defined pose shown through heat maps. 
Advantages; 
The suggested assignment is creative and groundbreaking. 
A novel architecture, with two stages starting from a broad approach and then refining it has been presented.
The document is organized easy to understand. 
Even though there are flaws, in the outcomes presented here they show potential.
The analysis of design choices is comprehensive and detailed.
Areas, for improvement; 
The quantitative assessment is somewhat restricted since there are no defined evaluation metrics, for this particular task.

In the proposed designs improvement process in consideration. It would be advantageous to incorporate research on iterative enhancement utilizing cascaded networks in the section on related work, from sources [A and B]. 
J.C., P.A., K.F. And J.M.s research on human body posture estimation through error correction was presented at the 2016 IEEE Conference, on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).
A study conducted by A.Newelll. K.Yangg. And J.Dengg. titled "Stacked hourglass networks for human pose estimation " was presented during the 2016 European Conference, on Computer Vision (ECCV).
At line 110 of the document mentioned earlier,"we observe that incorporating blocks as fundamental elements leads to enhanced generation performance." Could you elaborate specifically which aspects of performance see improvement due, to this alteration? 
 
The assessment covers a range of aspects; however it would be intriguing to explore how well the Stage 2 network functions when utilizing the Stage 1 inputs and being adversarially trained. Could the blurring seen with Stage 1 + GAN be linked to the connected layer in, between? 
Overall Evaluation; 
Considering the uniqueness of the issue and methodology presented in this paper I highly suggest approving it. 
Counterargument; 
Although I acknowledge the authorsâ€™ effort in carrying out a user study in their research paper review rating. I do feel it lacks thoroughness and persuasion to sway my opinion positively towards it; hence my decision to overlook its impact in my assessment of the work overall stays intact. The authors are advised to incorporate a thorough human evaluation in their revised manuscript to strengthen their case further and provide stronger arguments, for consideration. However my overall positive evaluation of the research work still stands firm and unchanged.
