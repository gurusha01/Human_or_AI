This research paper in neuroscience introduces a new approach to studying visual feature saliency from the ground up by incorporating dynamic systems modeling to understand scanpath dynamics better.The paper is quite interesting to read as it discusses thought provoking ideas like explaining "affordances," such as curiosity and brightness invariance that impact how scanpaths are created and applying the Least Action Principle.Although these "affordances" are introduced somewhat intuitively without explanation provided for them they do play a role, in shaping the papers overall theoretical foundation.  
When looking at the Action Principle in eye movement studies and considering the research done by the Wolpert lab as a point of reference – a deeper dive into its connection could have been helpful to enhance understanding in this context. Although the lack of inspiration might not raise major red flags given todays prevalence of deep learning models, for visual salience analysis that focus on stationary images; it's worth noting that the models performance variability compared to these standards stands out as a notable drawback. The models assertion that it can replicate the dynamics of biological eye movements would have been more informative if it had included descriptions of the scanpaths it produces in the main document – going beyond basic metrics to offer a deeper insight into the models abilities.
