This study explores how well the partial hard thresholding algorithm can recover support and calculates the number of iterations needed under conditions.  
The paper could be improved by providing an explanation of when the PHT(r) algorithm stops to help readers understand Proposition 1 better and, by offering specific examples and arguments to support the points made in the papers discussion at the end of Section 2. 
After the response was given back to meekly Inquire how to scale x_min to a value of O(ne) based on the context provided earlier. 
The paper could use some improvement in terms of clarity when explaining the simulations; the current description is too concise to establish a link between the simulation setups and the theoretical outcomes. It would be helpful to mention the function F(x) as well as the condition numbers and other parameters, from the theoretical results used in the simulations. Moreover it would be beneficial to evaluate whether 10 000 iterations are adequate considering the guarantees. Furthermore since non zero values of signals are generated as Gaussians, x_min values and specified s values differ across trials. In the main document of the study text is put forth as Lemma 19 and Theorem 20 in the supplementary materials without a clear indication that they are the same. 
The creativity shown in this piece is moderate as it builds upon established ideas related to recovering support through thresholding by introducing the concept of partial hard thresholding—an intricate expansion. 
The importance of this research is that it provides backing for ensuring recovery in the partial hard threshold algorithm which includes traditional hard threshold and orthogonal matching pursuit with replacement, as specific instances thus adding value to the domain. 
Some smaller details to think about are; 
I adjusted the text from "have should be has." to "has should be utilized of have."

Sure thing! Here's the paraphrased text; Line 76 should read as "An uppercase letter."
In Line 132 the term "restricted" could be better explained as " smooth.”
Then on line 196 change "The”, to "Then”.
Line 287 could be explained as "independent and identically distributed ". Normal" could be specified as "standard normal."
