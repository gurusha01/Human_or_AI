This paper introduces a version of the min sum algorithm called min sum splitting and uses it to address the distributed consensus challenge effectively.The document is well organized and clearly positions its contribution in relation to the developments in the field.Based on what I comprehend (though I'm not an expert in this domain) the results seem creative and mark a notable progression.The paper particularly establishes a connection, between min sum algorithms and lifted Markov chain methods. 
However there is one part of the presentation that needs some clarification. In the page the writers talk about a similar objective function that is minimized by the min sum algorithm to come up with the splitting scheme of min sum. They mention that each term $\phi_{vw}$ gets split into $ terms and each term $\phi_v $ into $\delta $ terms. This explanation is a bit confusing because $\delta $ and $\Gamma_{vw}$ are introduced as numbers in the previous page, which makes their role, in this context unclear.
