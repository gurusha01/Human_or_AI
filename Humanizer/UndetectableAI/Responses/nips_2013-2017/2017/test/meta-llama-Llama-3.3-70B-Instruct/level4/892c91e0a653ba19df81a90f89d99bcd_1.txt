The writers introduce a method called Adept that aims to improve the selection of stimuli in interactive experiments by increasing the variation in neural activity across a group of neurons instead of just focusing on individual neuron responses as past methods did. This innovation is crucial because previous techniques mainly concentrated on understanding how single neurons respond to stimuli. Adept utilizes calculated features of stimuli obtained from a neural network to forecast how neurons will fire in reaction, to new stimuli. The methodology is clearly. The process of selecting stimuli is effective enough to be used in practical experimental situations. 
Nevertheless there are a drawbacks linked to the Adept approach that could be tackled in upcoming studies. One important limitation is the algorithms dependence 	upon a collection of characteristics to portray the stimulus range, which may not be easily accessible beyond certain areas like V4. It would be valuable to explore how well the algorithm performs when the chosen features are insufficient for forecasting spike rates possibly resulting in less than learning results, for some of the neural group. Additionally the algorithm can only handle a number of inputs and its not clear how well it can handle different types of noise or correlated noise between cells or, over time. Further investigation is needed to understand how such noise might affect the selection of stimuli.
