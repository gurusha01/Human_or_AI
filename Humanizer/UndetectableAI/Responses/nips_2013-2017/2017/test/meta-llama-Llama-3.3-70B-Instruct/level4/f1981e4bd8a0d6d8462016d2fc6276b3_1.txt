This research paper introduces a method for teaching a sequence classifier when there is no labeled information available by utilizing sequential output patterns with the help of a language model. The way this algorithm is designed creates optimization difficulties in its structure which led to the creation of a practical primal dual gradient technique to tackle this problem effectively. What makes this approach stand out is its tendency to avoid reaching solutions and eliminates the necessity, for a generative model. Characteristics that set it apart from previous studies. Based on real world data tests have shown that the new approach results in errors compared to the standard methods used as a basis, for comparison. 
There are a points, in the paper that could benefit from more clarity or improvement.
The lines, in Figure 2(a) denoted as lambdad and lambdap need to be explained to help readers better grasp the outcomes. 
The core idea and the approach using dual stochastic gradient are interesting; however including more comparisons, with references [11] and [30] would make the paper stronger. Also analyzing datasets would improve the reliability of the results. 
In order to make the algorithm more transparent and easy to replicate it would be helpful to include gradient formulas, especially for the fifth step of Algorithm 1. This would enable readers to understand the method and potentially apply it themselves.
