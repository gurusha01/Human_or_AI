The researchers are exploring a model where the learner can ask questions to a knowledgeable source to figure out the desired clustering pattern; these questions can be about whether two items belong to the same cluster or based on a specific binary function of the labels assigned to input instances. The main goal of this research is to understand how complex it is to ask these questions, in frameworks. 
This new method of clustering based on queries is gaining interest in research circles. Has practical applications in areas like cleaning up duplicate records and utilizing crowd contributions effectively.The researchers take a view, from information theory to set boundaries for the number of queries needed to retrieve the desired clusters or approximate them. Even when dealing with incomplete or noisy information.The use of these information theory techniques is innovative. Stands out in the machine learning field. 
However the analysis is limited by not having assumptions about the structure of the issue like a pre established set of hypotheses. As a result the limitations are mostly affected by the distribution of labels and the level of noise. This scenario differs from learning theory frameworks, which typically involve more structured assumptions. Still this initial investigation adds to our knowledge of information aspects, in query based clustering especially in setting up relevant lower limits and marks an important starting point in this research area.
