This paper suggests a method, for teaching sequence classifiers without using labeled data through unsupervised learning techniques. The authors present a cost function called Empirical Output Distribution Match (Empirical ODM) which leverages output patterns like language models to train the classifier. The goal of the cost function is to align the classifiers output distribution with the expected distribution of output sequences. The writers also create a primal dual gradient (SPDG ) algorithm to enhance the Empirical ODM cost function and demonstrate its effectiveness, in overcoming the difficulties of optimizing the cost function. 
The authors have done a job with the paper; they've explained their approach clearly and in detail! The results from the experiments show how well their approach works. It's much better than unsupervised learning methods in terms of error rates!. They've taken the time to really dig into the results and talk about whats good and not so good, about their approach. 
The paper excels in areas such, as; 
A new unsupervised learning method is suggested, leveraging output patterns to train sequence classifiers without the need, for labeled data. 
An advanced optimization algorithm called SPDG has been created to tackle the difficulties, in optimizing the Empirical ODM cost function. 
The display of how the suggested method works based on thorough experimental findings. 
The paper has some drawbacks, such, as...
The limitation of the suggested method to linear classifiers might restrict its usefulness, for intricate models. 
The cost of running the SPDG algorithm could pose difficulties when scaling it up to accommodate vocabulary and advanced language models.
