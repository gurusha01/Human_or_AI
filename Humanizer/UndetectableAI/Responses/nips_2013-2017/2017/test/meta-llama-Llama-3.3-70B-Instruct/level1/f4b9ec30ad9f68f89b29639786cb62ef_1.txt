This research introduces a method for attaining resilience against Byzantine faults in decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms.The writers suggest an aggregation principle named Krum that is crafted to withstand Byzantine failures within a decentralized framework.The study delves into an examination of the Krum functionality encompassin its computational intricacy,resilience, against Byzantine faults and properties of convergence. 
The core concept of Krum revolves around choosing the vector that's most similar to its neighboring vectors among a group of workers where n represents the total number of workers and f denotes the number of potentially unreliable or Byzantine workers in the mix. The authors demonstrate that Krum upholds a property of resilience ensuring that the resulting output from the aggregation process remains close to the genuine gradient value. Additionally; they conduct an analysis on the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm utilizing Krum. Establish that this technique leads to reaching a plateau, in the cost function. 
The study also includes tests of Krums performance in handling Byzantine failures effectively.The researchers contrast Krum with averaging methods and illustrate its superior resistance, to Byzantine attacks.Additionally the study examines the trade off of resilience. Suggests ways to optimize Krum for decreased overhead costs.
