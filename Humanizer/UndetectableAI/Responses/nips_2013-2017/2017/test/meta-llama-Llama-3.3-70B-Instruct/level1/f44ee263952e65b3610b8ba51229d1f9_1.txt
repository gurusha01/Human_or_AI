This research introduces an addition to recurrent neural network language models known as the unbounded cache model that adjusts to shifts in data distribution by retaining all previously observed hidden activations. The model takes advantage of advancements in approximate nearest neighbor search and quantization techniques to effectively store and retrieve millions of representations. Through experiments on different language modeling tasks the authors showcase the success of their method by demonstrating notable enhancements in perplexity compared to pre trained language models, on unfamiliar distributions.
