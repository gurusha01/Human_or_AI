This paper makes an addition to the study of distributed optimization within the realm of the consensus issue, by introducing a revised Min Sum algorithm known as Min Sum Splitting that demonstrates faster convergence rates than conventional diffusive approaches do.It thoroughly examines the algorithms performance through demonstrating its convergence validity and assessing its rate of convergence. 
The papers strong points are; 
A new algorithm called Min Sum Splitting has been. Proven to be successful, in addressing the consensus issue. 
An in depth examination of how the algorithm behaves with a demonstration of its progress, towards a solution and an exploration of how it reaches that solution. 
The link between Min Sum Splitting and other advanced techniques, like lifted Markov chains and multi step gradient methods has been established. 
The paper is well structured and clear which helps in understanding the authorsâ€™ arguments. 
The papers shortcomings are as follows; 
The paper expects readers to have an understanding of distributed optimization and graph theory; this might pose a challenge for those without expertise, in these areas. 
The examination of the algorithms performance focuses on the consensus problem without a clear understanding of its applicability, to other optimization issues. 
The paper lacks a comparison with other cutting edge approaches, for addressing the consensus issue. 
Reasons, in favor of agreeing; 
The article introduces an algorithm that outperforms conventional diffusive methods in terms of achieving faster convergence rates. 
The algorithms behavior analysis is comprehensive. Backed by strong theoretical reasoning and practical experiments. 
The link, between Min Sum Splitting and other faster techniques offers perspectives on how these methods work. 
Points supporting acceptance include; 
The assumptions and analysis presented in the paper might be too focused, on an area of study which could restrict how widely the results can be applied to different optimization problems. 
Its challenging to evaluate Min Sum Splittings performance to other advanced methods due, to the limited comparison available. 
The intricate nature of the paper could pose a challenge for individuals, without expertise to grasp and comprehend the viewpoints put forth by the authors. 
In general the research paper makes an addition to the area of distributed optimization. The authors provide backing for their points, with both theoretical and numerical proof. However it is important to evaluate the constraints and presumptions of the paper and additional investigation is required to gain a complete grasp of the capabilities and boundaries of Min Sum Splitting.
