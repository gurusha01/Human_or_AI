This study delves into the issue of maximizing influence in networks using non submodular threshold functions—a departure, from the usual submodular influence diffusion models. The researchers present the idea of ε submodular threshold functions wherein some nodes exhibit non submodular thresholds that align closely with upper and lower bounds defined by submodular functions. The research paper highlights a challenge by demonstrating that it's impossible to develop a reliable algorithm that achieves a close approximation of 1/n to the power of γ for maximizing influence in graphs with nearly submodular nodes equivalent to n raised to the power of γ and, within ε margin unless the complexity class P equals NP. 
The authors then present an algorithm for graphs that have only a few non submodular nodes that might not be nearly ε submodular and focus on the scenario of nearly ε submodular nodes instead They introduce two algorithms; Galgorithm U and Galgorithm L that leverage the upper and lower bounds of the submodular functions’ threshold values respectively. The algorithms come with assurances and offer an approximation ratio of (approximately 63%)(one minus ε to the power of ) for graphs featuring nodes that are nearly submodular. 
The study also showcases findings using real life data sets like NetHEPT and Flixster as well as DBLP to highlight the efficiency of the suggested methods in contrast to standard techniques, like PageRank and High degree measures. The outcomes reveal that the suggested strategies excel over the ones particularly when dealing with graphs containing a significant number of ε almost submodular nodes. 
The positive aspects of this paper are; 
Introducing an idea called ε almost submodular threshold functions that enables the exploration of influence maximization, in non submodular scenarios. 
A robust finding on the hardness of the issue that establishes a basis, for its complexity. 
Greedy algorithms are offered with assurances for graphs containing a limited number of nodes that are close to being submodular, by epsilon (ε).
Results from experiments showcasing how well the suggested algorithms perform on datasets, from real world scenarios. 
The papers limitations are as follows; 
When the submodular bound or lower bound of the threshold function doesn't match the Triggering model the suggested algorithms tend to work at a slower pace. 
The research primarily centers on managing submodular threshold functions ε and the exploration continues into examining models, with various non submodular threshold functions.
