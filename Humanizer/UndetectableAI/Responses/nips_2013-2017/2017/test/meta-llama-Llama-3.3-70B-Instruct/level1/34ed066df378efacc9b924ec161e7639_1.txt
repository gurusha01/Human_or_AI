The paper introduces a Pose Guided Person Generation Network (PG2) which creates images of people in different poses using a reference image and desired pose as input data points.The authors adopt a two step method; the initial step produces an image aligned with the desired pose using a U net inspired network; subsequently the refined image is generated through a conditional DCGAN model.In addition to these techniques the authors suggest using a pose mask loss to reduce the impact of background variations, on synthesizing person images. 
The article is nicely. Effectively describes the suggested technique with details on the network structure and loss functions provided clearly by the authors.The experimental outcomes from two datasets showcase the efficiency of their method in producing person images of high quality convincingly.The findings indicate that their approach surpasses methods, like a single stage model and a model employing a distinct pose embedding technique. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
A new idea is being put forward that involves using a reference image and a target pose to generate images; this concept could have uses in the fields of computer vision and graphics. 
With a two step method, in place​ the creation of top notch images is made possible​ featuring an overall structure and intricate details​. 
A new approach called the pose mask loss has been suggested to reduce the impact of background variations, on creating person images. 
The paper has some drawbacks such, as; 
The absence of a comparison to other cutting edge techniques is due to the unique nature of the proposed task and the absence of established methods, for such comparisons. 
During the phase of creating images using AI models there is a risk of mode collapse which could result in a lack of variety, in the generated images. 
Requiring a volume of training data to yield satisfactory outcomes might pose a challenge, for certain applications.

Rating of 8, out of 10.
I suggest accepting it with some edits needed for improvement.The writers need to tackle the identified shortcomings such as comparing directly with other techniques and acknowledging the potential constraints of the suggested method.Additionally it would be beneficial if they delve into specifics, about how the model was implemented and trained.This includes detailing the hyperparameters employed and outlining the resources necessary.
