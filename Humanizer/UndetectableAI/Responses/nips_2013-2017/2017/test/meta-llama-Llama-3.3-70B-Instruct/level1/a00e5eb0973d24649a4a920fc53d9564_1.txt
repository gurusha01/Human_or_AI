This research paper explores in detail the situations in which techniques to decrease variance and speed up processes can effectively be used in solving finite sum optimization issues.The writers highlight the importance of identifying the function referenced by the oracle during each iteration for achieving linear convergence rates with a direct correlation to the number of functions n.They also prove that in the absence of information, about the level of strong convexity involved a wide range of first order and coordinate descent finite sum algorithms cannot benefit from acceleration techniques. 
The document is nicely. Simple to understand since it starts with a clear explanation of the issue and an, in depth review of relevant literature. 
The key contributions of the paper include; 
It is essential to identify the individuals function to achieve convergence rates with a direct correlation, to the number of participants involved. 
Showing that without an understanding of the strong convexity factor, in play is unable to achieve acceleration in a wide range of first order and coordinate descent finite sum algorithms. 
Determining the number of iterations required for oblivious algorithms to solve smooth and convex finite sum problems efficiently.
