This paper introduces a method to enhance the capability of Long Short Term Memory (LTSM) networks known as Tensorized LSTM (tLTSM). The tLTSM employs tensors to represent states and updates them through cross layer convolution which enables easy expansion and deepening of the network without a major increase in parameters or runtime duration is also minimal changes to the number of parameters or processing time are needed. Furthermore the authors present a memory cell convolution technique to incorporate long range relationships, from angles. 
The article is nicely. Effectively lays out the reasons behind the studys goals and methods along with the findings from experiments conducted by the authors. They delve into an examination of how well the tLong Short Term Memory (tLTSM) model performs across different tasks involving sequence learning like language prediction tasks and classifying images based on algorithms. The outcomes reveal that in instances the tLTSM surpasses other commonly used methods such as Stacked LSTMs and Convolutional LSTMs, in terms of performance. 
The paper excels in aspects, such, as; 
A new and effective method, for boosting the capacity of LSTMs has been recently introduced. 
In depth examination of how the tLong Short Term Memory model performs across different tasks.
A defined and structured demonstration of the approach and findings.
The papers shortcomings are as follows; 
Implementing and training the architecture could pose challenges due, to its complex nature.
Tweaking the hyperparameters might be necessary for the memory cell convolution mechanism to work smoothly.
The paper would be more helpful, with an examination of other cutting edge techniques.
Reasons, in favor of approval; 
"The paper presents an effective method, for enhancing the capacity of LSTMs."
The results from the experiment indicate that the tLong Short Term Memory (tLTSM) model performs better than commonly used methods, in various scenarios.
The paper is nicely. Effectively outlines the methodology and findings.
Reasons to not agree with it; 
The intricacy of the t LSTM design could pose challenges, in its implementation and training.
The paper might be improved by providing a thorough comparison, with other cutting edge approaches.
