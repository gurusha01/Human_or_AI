The author(s) suggest a method for detecting block formations in the IsIng model that could make parameter estimation more scalable when paired with approximate optimization techniques.. Here are my thoughts, on this proposed strategy; 
Comparison needed between the proposed screening procedure and eigenvalue decomposition on a graph Laplacian for effectiveness and computational efficiency after identifying block structures using methods, like clustering or regularized spectral clustering and applying exact or approximate optimization accordingly. 
The new screening rule based on the moment seems to have similarities with the screening rules put forward in the studies by Witten et al in 2011 and Mazumder & Hastie in 2010 could the authors provide more details on how their method differs or align with these established techniques, in the research field? 
How reliable is the block wise representation of $\theta?$ If the actual $\theta $ does not have a block format. Could the initial screening guideline lead to imprecise parameter estimation?
