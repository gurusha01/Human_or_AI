This article discusses the constraints of variance reduced stochastic algorithms when applied in finite sum scenarios like SAG and SDCA. These algorithms play a role in machine learning and convex optimization by achieving linear convergence for strongly convex problems with Lipschitz gradients (, with a logarithmic dependency) scaling with $ n + \ kappa $ instead of $ n \ kappa $.
The initial finding outlined in this research paper shows that iterative algorithms need the discern specific functions provided by the oracle in order for themachieve efficient convergence rates.Instances such as SAG and on this insight, for adjusting their gradient memory storage.Therefore its unsurprising that recognizing the function index is crucial. 
The paper also suggests that these methods that reduce variance may not work well with adding data during training sessions; although this issue is only relevant when the process of adding extra data is random and does not include a specific set of additional samples. 
The second outcome focuses on the chance of speeding up these algorithms that reduce variance in a way that aligns with the concept of "Nesterov sense." This involves decreasing the influence of condition numbers from $\textit{kappa}$ to $\sqrt{\textit{kappa}}$. The study reveals that algorithms termed "oblivious " which maintain update rules, on average throughout iterations are unable to achieve this accelerated progress. 
Achieving convergence in a stationary algorithm necessitates understanding the strong convexity parameter based on the initial finding outlined in Section 3. 
The article also explores the examination of algorithms employing reset strategies that are proven approaches to addressing the lack of adaptability, in faster algorithms when local circumstances are uncertain. 
The paper is nicely. Shows a clear teaching method. 
Just some small remarks.
The term CLI is initially introduced in Definition 2. Is referenced earlier in the text. 
There is a typo, in Line 224 that needs to be fixed. It should read " let us describe " instead of "Firstly let us we describe."
