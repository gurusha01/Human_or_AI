Summary of the review; 
The article presents a framework, for creating pictures of individuals by blending the likeness of a person from a given image with a designated pose input (depicted through heat maps).
Advantages; 
The suggested undertaking is groundbreaking in nature.   
Introducing an architectural approach that involves a gradual refinement process in two stages.   
The article is nicely. Easy to understand.   
The outcomes show some flaws but still offer hope, for the future.   
Thorough assessment of design decisions.   
Areas, for improvement; 
The numerical assessment is somewhat limited in strength. Is reasonable and not a major downside considering the absence of appropriate evaluation criteria, for the job.   
I'll provide the human paraphrased text shortly.
Given the nature of the suggested frameworks development process mention recent studies on iterative refinement via cascaded networks, in the relevant literature section. You may refer to [sources a and b].  
Jorge Carreira and his colleagues presented a study on pose estimation using iterative error feedback at the 2016 IEEE Conference, on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).  
The research paper titled "Stacked hourglass networks for pose estimation" by A.Newell,K.Yang and J.Deng was presented in the European Conference, on Computer Vision (ECCV) in 2016.   
Line 110 states that the performance in generation is enhanced by employing blocks as a fundamental element in the process but can you provide more details, on how exactly this improvement occurs?   
The assessment is quite comprehensive overall; I wonder how the Stage 2 network would fare if it received the inputs for Stage 1 directly and underwent training instead. Is the blurring seen in the results of Stage 1 + GAN caused by the connected layer in, between?   
In general how would you rate it?
Based on the originality of the issue and the suggested method presented in this paper I wholeheartedly suggest accepting it for publication.   
Counterargument; 
Although I acknowledge the authorsâ€™ attempt to carry out a user study and value their work to some extent Ifull unlike outcome I do not consider it entirely convincing enough for my evaluation purposes Therefore I have decided to disregard it However I strongly urge the authors to incorporate a thorough human assessment, in their revised version Nonetheless my overall positive opinion of the piece persists.
