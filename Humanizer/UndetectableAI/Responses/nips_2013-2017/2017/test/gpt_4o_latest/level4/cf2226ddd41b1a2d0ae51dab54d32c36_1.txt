The research paper explores the impact maximization issue in a submodular framework instead of the usual submodularity assumption. The problem being discussed is innovative. Comes with notable hurdles. However there are a couple of drawbacks in the paper; Firstly the credibility of the \epsilon AS assumption could be enhanced with convincing data analysis. Secondly the proofs are complex to understand; it would be beneficial to include explanations along, with examples to improve clarity.
