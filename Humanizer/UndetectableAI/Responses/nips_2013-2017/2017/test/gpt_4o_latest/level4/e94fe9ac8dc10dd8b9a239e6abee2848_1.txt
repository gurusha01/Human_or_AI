The paper discusses the issue of approximating a given matrix \( A \)(\( m \times n \)) with a rank \ (Bra k\) matrix \(A'\) aiming to minimize the element \( \ell 1\) distance between them in the context of \( \ell 4\) Low Rank Approximation Technique, in mathematics research. Create a matrix \( A'\) ensuring that the difference between \( A \text { and } A'\) measured by the \( || \cdot ||_{0}\) is less than or equal to a function of \( k \log(mn)\times OPT_k \) where \( OPT_k \text { represents the nearest rank k matrix, to } A. \) 
Furthermore the paper presents a \((2 + \epsilon)\) approximation when \( k\) is 1 in less than linear time and introduces a method for binary matrices that seems to be more applicable in real world scenarios. However the accuracy of the approximation for the scenario is influenced by the optimal solutions value and shows good performance only when \( \text{OPT}\ equals O(|| A||_{0})\) sparking concerns, about the reliability of the outcome. 
The issue is supported by theory. Is commonly known but lacks clear proof of its real world usefulness in practice within the papers arguments The document needs empirical evidence and a detailed description of how the problem is significant, in practical situations Despite the results being precise and technically correct some assumptions are made without enough explanation; 
The claim that the total of rows and columns can be accessed in \(O(m + n)\) time (lines 138–140) lacks support. With the knowledge of \( || A ||_{\text{O}} \) and access, to adjacency lists these totals can be calculated efficiently. This assumption seems crucial for Theorems 13 and 14 however achieving the runtime assurances could involve investing \( || A ||_{\text{O}} \) time in their computation. 
The claim, about the difficulty or the inability to approximate Boolean \( \ell _{ 10 } \) rank one approximation appears extreme and lacks adequate backing evidence. 
A few quick thoughts, on the matter.
Change "rank k" to "rank \ ( k \ )”.
You should change "min(\({ mn}^{ 1 } { mn}^{ 1 })\)" to "min(\({ mn}^{ 1 } m^{ 1 }{ n}^{ 1 })\)" at line 33.
Incorporate the idea of the incident list access model as it is an approach, in designing algorithms that operate efficiently within sublinear time constraints (lines 131–137).
Line 168 should be revised from \( S^{ ( 2  ) }=[ n ] \to S^{ ( 2 ) }=[ m ] \).
"We should replace 'The', with 'we'." 
The paper delves into a thought provoking issue and shows some meaningful advancements in this field of study; nonetheless its real world relevance is not adequately substantiated. The absence of data and rationale, for practical applications undermines the overall impact of the work.
