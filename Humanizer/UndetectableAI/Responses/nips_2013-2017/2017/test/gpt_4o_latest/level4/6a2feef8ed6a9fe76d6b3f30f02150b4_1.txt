This article presents an efficient block coordinate descent (BC D ) method that includes a new Tikhonov regularization approach for training dense and sparse deep neural networks (DDNs). The writers show that this BC D method they suggest reaches a convergence to a steady point with an R linear rate of convergence of order one and performs better than different stochastic gradient descent (SG D ) versions in practical tests.However the reasoning, for using Tikhonov regularization and block coordinate descent is not adequately clarified. Moreover the technical presentation is unclear because important details are missing.The results from the experiments do not meet the standards of performance expected today.This has led to concerns about how practical the proposed method would be, for world "deep neural networks" applications.Here are my specific comments; 
I've rewritten your text to ensure that it sounds more human like, free of any markers that may give away its machine origins. Here is the revised version; "I work on a system that analyzes text to determine if it was generated by a machine learning model or written by a human. The system considers factors, like part of speech distribution and common characteristics of AI generated text." 
I'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the paraphrased text without the original input to work with. Could you please provide the text that needs to be rewritten?
The reasoning behind opting for Tikhonov regularization needs explanation and clarity. Why was Tikhonov regularization preferred over regularization techniques? What benefits does it bring compared to other methods? In the sections opening paragraph of the paper the authors discuss various hurdles encountered in DNN applications, such, as complex landscapes and local extremums before introducing Tikhonov regularization. Does this mean that Tikhonov regularization effectively tackles all these obstacles? 
The reasoning behind breaking down the issue into three problems is not well explained by the authors, who should elaborate on how this approach helps to prevent challenges, like vanishing gradients. 
The transition from Equation (4 ) to Equation ( 5 ) is quite complex to understand. In particular could you clarify the formula, for the matrix \( Q(\tilde{\mathcal { A}})\) as mentioned in line 133 ? How can we guarantee that \( Q(\tilde{\mathcal { A}})\)) is semidefinite ?
We should offer an specific mathematical explanation, for the Tikhonov regularized inverse problem. 
The claim that solving the inverse sub problem in deep learning addresses the vanishing gradient problem is quite bold, without any supporting theoretical or empirical evidence to back it up. 
Further information is required to clarify why the characteristics of the "output align, with those of target propagation. 
At line 246 of the document there seems to be a missing explanation, for \( \mathcal { P } \). It would be helpful to provide some clarification on this point. 
In Figure 5 of the study discussed here it's interesting to note that BCD S seems to develop networks, with connections overall. However the weight matrix of the layer appears to maintain a high level of interconnectedness. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify this difference in their explanation. 
At line 252, in the document " Q " needs to be clarified as its meaning is not clear. Should be explained. 
At line 284 of the document is a word missing. It should be "dense".
The references need to be fixed as the formatting's not consistent. 
The selection of the network structure depicted in Figure 1 lacks clarity to me as a reader.. The network employed in the study consists of three hidden layers and is lacking in depth compared to other models commonly regarded as "deep." Is there a need to include connections, for improvement?. Moreover the results obtained from the experiments do not match up to the performance of cutting edge techniques used in this field. which brings into question how viable the proposed approach would be when applied to real world scenarios involving neural networks.
