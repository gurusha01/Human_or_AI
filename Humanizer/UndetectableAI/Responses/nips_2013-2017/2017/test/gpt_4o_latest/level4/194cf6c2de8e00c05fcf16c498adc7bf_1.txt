This paper in neuroscience discusses a novel model for visual feature saliency from a bottom up perspective that has been enhanced through the use of dynamical systems modeling to analyze scanpath dynamics. I enjoyed reading the paper. Found its creative concepts intriguing. Especially the exploration of "affordances," such as curiosity and brightness invariance that impact scanpaths along, with the utilization of the Least Action Principle. However I noticed that these "affordances," while interestingly introduced in the paper may lack justification or deeper motivation. 
In the realm of the Least Action Principle and its derivation process it could have been beneficial to link this study to work in eye movement research like contributions from the Wolpert lab both older and more recent ones.Lack of biological basis is not a big worry in todays world where deep learning models are showing great prowess, in visual salience aspects.The main problem arises from the models inconsistent and less impressive performance when compared to these established models. The models assertion of mimicking the dynamics of natural eye movements could have been improved by showcasing visuals in the document that specifically depict the produced scanpaths not only based on their general data but also in relation, to real eye movement patterns.
