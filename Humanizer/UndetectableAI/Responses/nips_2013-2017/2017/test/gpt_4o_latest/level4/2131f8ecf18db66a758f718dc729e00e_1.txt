The researchers are exploring a system that allows the user to engage with an expert by asking questions in order to determine the desired clustering outcome effectively and efficiently. These questions could involve determining if certain instances belong to the cluster or be based on a specific function related to the labels of input data. The main emphasis of the study is, on examining how many queries are needed for these models to achieve their objectives successfully. 
This approach to clustering based on queries is an actively researched field that has practical uses in tasks such as removing duplicate records and utilizing crowdsourcing in various areas of interest like record keeping and data management among others.The researchers tackle the issue from an information theory angle by establishing limits, on the minimum and maximum number of queries needed to reconstruct the desired clustering outcome or approximate it.They also broaden their examination to situations where the data source may not be completely reliable or consistent. The techniques related to information theory discussed in the paper are new. Have caught the attention of researchers in the field of machine learning. 
However the analysis is limited by not assuming any structure of the problem (such as having a hypothesis class). The bounds mainly rely on the distribution of labels and noise level which sets this study apart from learning theory frameworks.The research serves as a first step, towards understanding the information theoretic principles of query based clustering and establishing relevant lower bounds.
