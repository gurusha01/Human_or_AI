This study explores using a version of the min sum algorithm called min sum splitting to tackle the challenge of distributed consensus in a research paper that is very well written and places the findings in the current context of this field quite effectively in my opinion (although I'm not an expert in this particular area). The outcomes seem innovative. Mark a notable improvement in quality, from what I gathered. The paper cleverly links min sum algorithms, with lifted Markov chain methods. 
One part of the presentation isn't very clear, on page 4 when they talk about breaking down each term $\phi_{vw}$ into $\Gamma_{vw}$ terms and each term $\phi_v $ into $\delta $ terms for the min sum splitting scheme. The explanation is unclear because $\delta$ and $\Gamma_{vw}$ are previously defined as numbers, in the preceding page; therefore it's not evident what exactly "splitting" refers to in this situation.
