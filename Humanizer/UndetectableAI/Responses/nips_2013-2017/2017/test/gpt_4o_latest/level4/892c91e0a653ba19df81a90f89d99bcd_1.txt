The researchers present a method called Adept to choose stimuli in closed loop studies with the aim of increasing variability in how neural populations fire signals.The approach marks a progress in selecting stimuli for closed loop experiments as it shifts away from focusing solely on understanding how individual neurons respond to stimuli.The method uses calculated features of stimuli from a neural network to forecast the firing rates, for new stimuli. The techniques are clearly. The process for choosing stimuli is efficient in a way that makes it suitable for practical use, in real world experiments. 
However there are constraints to the Adept approach (which could be tackled in future research). As stated by the creators of the method its usefulness relies on having a range of characteristics to depict the range of stimuli. These characteristics may not always be easily accessible outside fields like V4. It would be interesting to explore how well the method performs when the selected characteristics do not fully encompass the foundations, for forecasting spike rates— for certain portions of the neural community. For example would the algorithm do well than choosing random stimuli, for those neurons?   
Moreover​ the algorithm is only able to work with a number of specific inputs​. Lastly​ it is not clear how the process of selecting stimuli can be impacted by forms of interference​ especially when there is a correlation in the noise between neurons or over time, in the responses that are recorded​.
