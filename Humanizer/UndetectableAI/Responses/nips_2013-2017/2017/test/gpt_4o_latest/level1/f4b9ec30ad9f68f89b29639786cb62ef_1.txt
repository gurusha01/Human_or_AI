The paper discusses the issue of Byzantine resilience in distributed implementations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) a fundamental algorithm in machine learning research. The authors present an aggregation method called Krum that is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally to handle Byzantine failures successfully—a challenge that traditional linear aggregation techniques struggle with. The papers contributions involve highlighting the drawbacks of methods and defining a resilience criterion for aggregation methods. Moreover they introduce Krum as a solution that meets this criterion when \(2f + 2\) is less, than the number of participants (n).The authors also present an analysis, on convergence. Share experimental findings that showcase Krums resilience to fake workers and its performance differences when compared to traditional averaging methods. 
Advantages; 
The article addresses a explored but important issue in distributed machine learning. The ability to handle Byzantine errors effectively and efficiently introduces a fresh perspective by introducing Krum while integrating ideas, from both distributed computing and statistical robustness into the mix. 
The authors thoroughly define resilience and demonstrate that Krum meets this criterion in a formal manner. They delve into a convergence analysis rooted in well established SGD theory and expand it to adversarial environments. 
The experiments effectively show Krums ability to withstand types of Byzantine attacks, like Gaussian and all knowing adversaries are well demonstrated in the experiments conducted The introduction of Multi Krum also underscores the versatility of this method. 
The paper effectively discusses the constraints of approaches and the importance of a strong aggregation strategy, within the wider realm of distributed machine learning and Byzantine fault tolerance. 
Areas Needing Improvement; 
When dealing with complexity in larger distributed systems with high dimensional parameter spaces, Krums complexity of \( O(n^{ 22 } \cdot d ) \) although feasible, for smaller systems might pose challenges that the authors recognize but do not address with feasible scalability solutions. 
The experimental tests in the research only target tasks like spam filtering and image classification using specific datasets, for evaluation purposes only instead of considering a wider range of machine learning models and real world distributed systems to enhance the credibility of the findings. 
In corrupted scenarios where there are no Byzantine faults to consider when comparing convergence speeds between Krum and averaging methods reveals that Krum takes longer to converge—a downside worth noting. Though Multi Krum attempts to address this concern by improving efficiency in handling situations where multiple failures occur simultaneously ("Byzan tine settings") a more comprehensive examination of the balance, between resilience and effectiveness is warranted. 
In the analysis of resilience in scenarios like federated learning where non i.i.d data settings are common it is assumed that gradient estimators are precise and have limited variability but this may not always be the case, in practical situations. 
Reasons to consider; 
The article discusses an relevant issue, with an innovative solution based on solid theoretical foundations. 
The strength and usefulness of Krum are showcased through a blend of examination and real world testing. 
The research could have impacts on academic and industrial sectors alike. Especially, in the fields of federated learning and adversarial machine learning. 
Reasons to Not Agree; 
The Krum algorithms computational demands might hinder its usefulness, in systems. 
The range of experiments is a bit limited. Its important to delve deeper into the trade offs affecting how quickly things come together. 
Suggestion; 
In general the paper makes an impact, in the realm of distributed machine learning and fault tolerant optimization. Although there are some limitations, the originality, theoretical soundness and practical significance of the study surpass the shortcomings. I suggest accepting it with adjustments to tackle scalability issues and enhance the experimental analysis.
