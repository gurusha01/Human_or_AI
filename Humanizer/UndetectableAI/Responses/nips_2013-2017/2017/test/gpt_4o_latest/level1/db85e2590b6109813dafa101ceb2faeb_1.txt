Evaluation of the document
This research suggests a method for compressing deep neural networks by incorporating a low rank regularizer into the training process to address compression right from the beginning instead of focusing solely on compressing networks after training like current methods do which can result in less than optimal outcomes due to the absence of low rank structure, in pre trained networks. By adding a rank regularizer to the training loss function the new technique promotes the parameter matrices of each layer to have a low rank which helps achieve higher compression rates while maintaining accuracy levels well enough. Furthermore the authors expand on their method by merging the rank regularizer with a sparse group Lasso regularizer which allows for eliminating entire units, for additional compression purposes. The results of our experiments show an increase in compression rates (up to 90%) while maintaining near perfect accuracy, on ImageNet and ICDAR datasets when compared to the best existing methods. 
Advantages
The research paper presents a viewpoint by incorporating compression within the training phase instead of the conventional method of compressing post training stages.This unique approach adds insights, to the realm of model compression. 
The suggested approach is firmly based on theory by utilizing the norm as a convex relaxation technique for minimizing ranks effectively and appropriately incorporating proximal stochastic gradient descent, for optimization purposes. 
The researchers tested their approach on structures like DecomposeMe and ResNet 50 as well as datasets such as ImageNet and ICDAR demonstrating its effectiveness through thorough experiments with substantial empirical proof to support it.The outcomes indicated enhancements, in compression rates and computational efficiency when juxtaposed with current techniques. 
The method is especially useful for implementing networks in devices with limited resources, like embedded systems where efficient memory usage and runtime are crucial. 
The paper is structured effectively. Written in a clear manner with thorough descriptions of the research approach used and the outcomes obtained from the experiments conducted in it. 
Areas of improvement
There is a mention about the impact on hardware in the paper noting that the suggested technique might be advantageous for tailored hardware like FPGAs; however it fails to offer in depth explanations on how this translates to tangible hardware performance in real world scenarios. The absence of reductions in inference time on contemporary GPUs sparks inquiries about its feasibility, for real world implementation. 
Energy threshold sensitivity is a factor to consider when it comes to post processing as the specific percentage chosen (such as 80 or 90%) can vary depending on the dataset and is somewhat subjective, in nature impacting generalizability of the method. 
The paper briefly touches upon the fact that its method's different from weight quantization but it does not delve into the potential benefits of combining both approaches, for enhanced compression advantages. 
Scalability to Architectures; Although the approach was examined on ResNet‐50​ architecture​ its adaptability to extensive architectures, like GPT or Vision Transformers remains uninvestigated​​​​​​​ constraining its application range.
