The methods practical utility and scalability are underscored by the findings on synthetic and real world datasets. 
Advantages; 
The technical contribution is solid from a standpoint with well explained derivations and proofs included in the additional materials provided.It fills a gap in existing research by tackling the lack of screening rules for discrete graphical models, like sparse Isings models specifically. 
The results, from the experiment clearly show that the screening rule helps lower the amount of computing power and memory needed when working with datasets. It's a step forward to be able to manage thousands of variables on just one machine. 
The research expands the screening rule to include imprecise optimization techniques like node logistic regression and pseudolikelihood estimation to demonstrate its flexibility effectively.With the additional discussion on generalizing to models, with potentials also being a noteworthy inclusion. 
The real world application of gene mutation data showcases how this method is valuable, for analyzing networks—a field where scalability and interpretability are essential. 
The paper is nicely. Easy to follow with clear descriptions of the theoretical findings and experimental procedures provided in a structured manner that includes pseudocode (Algorithm 1) making it easier to replicate the results. 
Areas that could use improvement; 
The paper briefly touches on the use of inexact methods when combining them with the screening rule but mainly concentrates on node wise logistic regression and pseudolikelihood during the experimental assessment step Instead of focusing solely on these two methods mentioned above a more comprehensive examination of different inexact methods could provide stronger support, for the claims regarding generalizability. 
The paper operates under the assumption that the screening rule's flawless when paired with precise optimization while also recognizing the possibility of inaccuracies with imprecise methods, in theoretical terms and suggests that additional analysis of the circumstances where the screening rule remains useful with imprecise methods would be advantageous. 
The practical use of the method is confined to one dataset so conducting more tests on various datasets, from different fields could show how well the method works in different scenarios. 
The paper compares its technique to methods like NW and PL without screening but does not conduct a comparison with other cutting edge methods, for estimating large scale graphical models that could offer a more thorough assessment. 
Reasons, in favor of acceptance; 
The article discusses an issue that has not received much attention in the field of estimating sparse graphical models. 
The suggested screening guideline is innovative in its approach and robust, in theory while also holding practical relevance. 
The experimental findings clearly show improvements, in efficiency and scalability. 
This approach is expected to spark exploration into developing screening guidelines, for other types of graphical models and optimization methods. 
Reasons to Consider Not Approving; 
The assessment of techniques has certain constraints and the theoretical assurances for their integration, with the screening protocol are not thoroughly investigated. 
The practical use cases are limited in scope. Could benefit from more data to enhance the credibility of the findings. 
There is potential for enhancement in testing due to the absence of comparisons, with other cutting edge techniques. 
Suggestion; 
In general​ this study adds significantly to the realm of estimating graphical models and would be a fitting choice for showcasing at NIPS​ Despite certain areas that could be enhanced​ especially, in assessing less precise methods and conducting more extensive empirical validation​ the papers strong points surpass its shortcomings​ I suggest approving it for publication​
