This study discusses how to maximize influence in networks when using non submodular diffusion models and the general threshold model with epsilon almost submodular threshold functions as a focus point specifically considered by the authors in this paper. They demonstrate a challenge in approximating influence maximization even when dealing with nodes that are near submodular. Not exactly so. The authors propose methods of approximation that come with assurances, for networks that have a few epsilon almost submodular nodes and validate these approaches through experiments conducted using real world datasets. The findings indicate that their algorithms are more effective than methods, in terms of spreading influence and computational speed. 
The study expands on the basis laid down in research on maximizing influence by Kempe et al (2003 ) and Mossel & Roch (2007) which utilize submodularity to create effective algorithms. Nevertheless the writers take this research in a direction by delving into the lesser explored realm of non submodular contexts inspired by observations in real world networks (, like Backstrom et al., 2006 and Yang et al., 2012 ) that often showcase influence dynamics that are not submodular. Their research is connected to the ideas explored in submodularity studies (referenced in Horely et al., 2016) as well, as the optimization of functions that are not submodular (referenced in Du et al., 2013).
Advantages; 
The paper explores an area that hasn't been thoroughly examined before by discussing how to maximize influence in settings that're n't submodular using ε almost submodular functions—an interesting expansion, on previous research. 
The authors offer a finding of complexity and establish assurance of accuracy for their methods, through thorough proofs and analysis. 
The suggested algorithms are tested using real world datasets such, as NetHEPT, Flixster and DBLP to show their efficiency when compared to methods. 
The experiments are explained clearly with all the details about how they were set up and the outcomes are shown in a manner that indicates consistent enhancements, in performance compared to the established standards. 
Ensuring efficiency is crucial for large scale networks and techniques such as Reverse Reachable Sets (RRsets ) play a significant role, in achieving scalability. 
Areas of improvement; 
The paper mainly discusses almost submodular functions as a basis for its study but might not encompass the full range of non submodular behaviors evident, in actual networks as the authors recognize this constraint without delving into broader non submodular scenarios. 
The performance guarantees rely heavily upon the parameter ε without delving into the practical implications of different ε values, like how reliable the algorithms are when ε is large or challenging to estimate. 
The complexity of algorithms is a concern when dealing with ε submodular nodes and their scalability might be affected as the number of these nodes grows substantially based o!n the experimental evidence provided in the study; this issue warrants further investigation. 
When assessing their techniques against measures such, as PageRank and High Degree heuristics the authors fail to test them against more sophisticated influence maximization algorithms like those presented by Borgs et al., 2014 and Tang et al., 2015 in comparable scenarios. 
Suggestion; 
Advantages, in favor of approval; 
The article offers an significant perspective, on maximizing influence through the exploration of non submodular diffusion models.

The study is important for researchers, in the field of social network analysis and algorithm design whether they focus on theory or practical applications. 
Downsides for Approval; 
The emphasis, on submodular functions might restrict the breadth of the outcomes. 
The article could improve by including extensive comparisons, with the latest methods and delving deeper into the sensitivity of parameters.
