The article discusses a method called Tensorized LSTM (tLTSM) which aims to enhance the capability of Long Short Term Memory (LTSM) networks by using tensorized hidden states and utilizing cross layer convolutions effectively. The authors suggest that this approach enables LSTMs to widen and deepen efficiently without a rise in parameters or runtime. They showcase the efficacy of tLTSM through tests across five sequence learning assignments such, as language modeling tasks and image classification. The findings indicate that the tSRLT model performs better, than LSTMs and other cutting edge approaches in terms of precision and computational effectiveness â€“ especially for tasks involving extensive temporal relationships. 
Areas of advantage; 
The paper is solid from a perspective, with well defined mathematical formulations and derivations presented by the authors explaining the implementation of tensorization and cross layer convolutions and how they offer benefits compared to traditional LSTMs. 
The concept of transforming states into tensors and combining complex calculations with temporal computations is quite inventive and forward thinking. Moreover the introduction of memory cell convolution boosts the capacity to capture dependencies over long distances effectively tackling a prominent drawback, in current LSTM designs. 
The experiments provide an assessment across various tasks and include ablation studies like removing memory cell convolutions or feedback connections to enhance result credibility through comparisons, with cutting edge techniques. 
Efficiency is a focus of the paper, on t LSTMs computational speediness; it demonstrates impressive results without significantly increasing processing time and is well suited for real time usage scenarios. 
The paper is nicely. Structured with clear explanations and visuals as well as additional information in the appendices to enhance the main contents support.They also offer insights, into the inner workings of tLong Short Term Memory (tLTSM).
Areas, for improvement; 
The real world applications for t LSTM are currently limited in scope as most experiments focus mainlyon tasks like Wikipedia language modeling and MNIST dataset analysis.However it would be advantageous to test t LSTM in challenging real world scenarios such, as speech recognition or video processing tasks. 
Scalability is not extensively addressed in the paper regarding tRNNs when applied to handling large datasets or extremely deep networks despite demonstrating efficient runtime performance; the practical implementation, for large scale tasks still lacks clarity. 
The authors touch upon convolutional methods briefly; however a thorough comparison, with TCNs would enhance the paper since both are meant for sequence modeling. 
Understanding the meaning of memory cell visualization is helpful. Further exploration is needed to understand the interpretability of tLTSMs learned representations when compared to regular LSTMs. 
Reasons to consider approval; 
The research paper introduces an well founded method to enhance LSTMs backed by solid theoretical and practical evidence. 
The suggested tLong Short Term Memory (tLTSM) model demonstrates results, in various demanding assignments all the while ensuring efficient computational performance. 
The writing is very clear. Adds a valuable perspective, to the realm of sequence modeling. 
Reasons Not to Agree; 
The results may not be widely applicable due to the absence of analysis, on real world datasets. 
The method doesn't completely tackle scalability, for large tasks. 
Suggestion; 
My suggestion is to approve this paper. Even though there are a drawbacks mentioned the new tLTSM brings a notable progress in the realm of recurrent neural networks providng both theoretical understanding and tangible advantages. Focusing efforts, towards addressing scalability and practicality could amplify its influence.
