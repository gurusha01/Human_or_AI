This study delves into the connection between encodable source coding (LESC) and semi supervised clustering by introducing new theoretical findings and practical methods for effectively retrieving labels in crowdsourcing scenarios.The researchers suggest a questioning approach that relies on AND queries and showcase its advantages over same cluster" (XOR ) queries in terms of query effectiveness and resistance, to errors. Their research involves establishing bounds on how much data is needed for queries to be effective and suggesting nearly perfect strategies for asking questions without adjusting based on previous answers; they confirm the validity of their approaches through theoretical examination and practical testing, with real people contributing information. 
Advantages; 
The paper brings up the idea of LESC within the realm of clustering and crowdsourcing from an angle which is innovative and exciting to see in research work.The utilization of AND queries of XOR queries is a noteworthy addition that offers a more efficient approach both, in theory and application wise. 
The authors back up their arguments with explanations and evidence by demonstrating the minimum query complexity and effectiveness assurance of their algorithms using information theory and rate distortion theory principles that highlight their technical expertise. 
The article tackles an issue in crowdsourcing. The importance of reducing query expenses. The use of data sets such as movie clustering, in the experiments adds credibility to the suggested techniques and demonstrates their practical usefulness. 
The researchers confirm their discoveries by testing them on both artificial and real life data sets showcasing the practical benefits of the suggested method through a comparison of AND queries and "same cluster" queries. 
The paper effectively explains its contributions by detailing close recovery methods as well as addressing noisy queries and conducting experimental validation. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper is quite detailed and technical in nature which might be tough for readers not well versed in information theory or clustering to understand due to its complexity and lack of clarity, in explaining the notation and mathematical derivations despite their accuracy. 
The practical experiments have some constraints; they are not conducted at a scale (, for example only 200 movies). Conduct larger scale experiments. Compare them with other advanced clustering methods to enhance the empirical findings. 
Assumptions regarding noise in queries may not always align with all crowdsourcing situations as the independence assumption is generally considered standard practice in such cases. A discourse, on how correlated noise and adversarial environments can influence robustness would be beneficial. 
The theoretical analysis mainly concentrates on labels (where k equals 3) with minimal investigation into scenarios involving multiple classes (with k greater, than 3). Expanding the findings to situations would increase the importance of the paper. 
Reasons supporting acceptance; 
The article provides a theoretical contribution, by linking LESC with clustering and establishing new limits. 
The new framework, for conducting AND queries is groundbreaking and feasible. Has proven benefits compared to current approaches. 
The blend of theoretical framework and practical validation adds significant value, to the field. 
Arguments opposing acceptance; 
The way the paper is written might make it hard for a wider audience to understand it easily. 
The experimental confirmation shows potential. Is somewhat constrained in size and extent. 
The emphasis, on using two labels could limit how broadly we can apply the findings. 
Suggestion; 
This paper shows promise for acceptance as it pushes the boundaries in clustering and crowdsourcing through a fresh querying framework and, in depth theoretical analysis.. Though there are areas that could be clearer and have an experimental reach the positives of the study outweigh its drawbacks.. I suggest accepting it with some revisions to enhance readability and extend the experimental assessment..
