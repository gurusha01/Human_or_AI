This study delves into the constraints of methods that reduce variance and speed up the optimization of finite sums with a focus on how algorithmic assumptions influence the bounds on iteration complexity that can be achieved. The authors highlight three findings in their research; (A\) simply having a finite sum structure is not enough to meet the complexity bound \( \tilde\( ( n + \myfrac { L } { \mu } ) \ln\( 39; 999 )\) unless the oracle explicitly points out which specific function is being queried; (B\) faster rates, around \( \tilde\( ( n + \sqrt { nL / \mu } ) \ln\( 39; 999 )To achieve outcomes in algorithms requires understanding the strong convexity parameter explicitly; furthermore for smooth and convex finite sums algorithms with fixed update rules have inherent limitations to \( \Omega(n + L/\epsilon)\). These findings are backed by proofs and reasoning based on information theory along, with the use of Canonical Linear Iterative (CLI) algorithm framework. 
The study expands on research in reducing variance methods (like SAG, SVRG SDCA ) and speeding up techniques (such as Nesterovs AGD) while tackling unresolved issues regarding their theoretical boundaries. The writers build upon findings from studies, like [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and [ 16 ] offering fresh perspectives on how oracle assumptions and algorithm design influence the number of iterations needed. The application of restart strategies in examining and arched situations stands out significantly as it connects the differences, between highly arched and less arched scenarios. 
Advantages; 
The paper is thorough and precise in its analysis by presenting elaborate proofs that rely on sophisticated methods, from information theory and polynomial approximation to set precise limits at the lower end of the spectrum. 

The article explores scenarios such as smooth and strongly convex cases and smooth and convex instances as well, as oblivious algorithms to provide a thorough view of the issue at hand. 
The results are presented clearly with a focus of indicating the contributions and effectively communicating the practical implications for algorithm design such as the need, for explicit enumeration or a strong understanding of convexity principles. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The papers theoretical findings are important; however it lacks an exploration of how these constraints could impact real world usage and how professionals could deal with them. 
The content in this paper is intricate. Presupposes a substantial understanding of optimization theory and CLI frameworks along with variance reduction methods which might make it less accessible, to a wider range of readers. 
Experimental Validation Section; The paper focuses on theory however including some real world examples to showcase the practical implications of these limitations would enhance the credibility of the study. 
Reasons, in Favor of Approval; 
"The study adds theoretical insights, by pinpointing the inherent constraints of commonly employed optimization methods."
The findings are original and thorough as they advance the understanding in the theory of finite sum optimization. 
The research is very important, for the NeurIPS community since variance reduction and acceleration methods are widely used in the field of machine learning. 
Reasons to Not Agree with It; 
The emphasis on findings in the paper without real world confirmation could potentially hinder its relevance to professionals, in the field right away. 
The complex way the information is presented and the use of math tools might make it hard for the average person to understand the paper. 
Suggestion; 
Sure thing! Here is the paraphrased version; "I suggest approving this paper as it makes theoretical contributions and explores key issues in the field of optimization. However it would be beneficial for the authors to discuss real world implications and ways to address the limitations identified in future updates."
