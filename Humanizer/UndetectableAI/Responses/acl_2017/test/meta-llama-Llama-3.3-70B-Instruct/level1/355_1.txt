A Brief Overview of the Paper
The paper suggests a network method for analyzing the predicate argument structure (Pas). This task is essential in handling natural language processing tasks in the Japanese language context. The writers present two models. One that follows a single sequence approach and another that uses a sequence method. Both models utilize neural networks (RNNS) focusing on understanding the contextual details within word sequences. The multi sequence model stands out for using grid style RNNS to explore the connections, between predicates within a single sentence. The tests conducted on the NAIST Text Corpus show that the suggested models perform better, than the existing methods​—particularly in zero argument identification​—which is a difficult aspect of Japanese PAS analysis. 
Major Contributions
The study reveals that word order details can be utilized efficiently for analyzing PAS without depending on syntax information. 
The authors introduce a design called grid type RNN to capture the relationships, among various predicates within a sentence. 
The models suggested in the study outperform others on the NAIST Text Corpus and show success in identifying zero arguments specifically.
