Synopsis of the Document
The article suggests an approach to maintaining consistency within a text using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that works with the entity grid representation of the text content focusing on both long distance entity connections and unique entity characteristics while maintaining overall flexibility The writers introduce a pairwise ranking technique to teach the model for a specific objective, in an integrated manner and acquire task specific advanced attributes. The models performance on three coherence assessment tasks shows that its results are cutting edge and surpass those of other models, by a notable margin. 
Primary Contributions
The paper suggests a framework that enhances the well known entity grid models by enabling the representation of distant transitions, between entities and integrating entity specific characteristics while maintaining generalizaton capabilities effectively. 
The authors present a structure to depict changes, in entities effectively and prevent the model from memorizing excessively long entity transitions. 
The paper introduces a pairwise ranking method to train the model for a task and acquire task specific characteristics that enable comprehensive training and enhance the models effectiveness. 
Advantages
The model delivers top notch performance on three coherence evaluation tasks showcasing its ability to capture local coherence effectively. 
The neural structure and convolutional method allow the model to understand transitions between entities over distances and incorporate unique features of each entity.This makes it adaptable and applicable, to tasks and datasets. 
End to end training is made easier, with the pairwise ranking method as it simplifies the training process and enhances the models performance. 
Areas of improvement
Understanding why the model makes decisions and what factors influence its performance can be tricky due, to the complexity of architecture and convolutional methods used. 
The models effectiveness could be influenced by the selection of hyperparameters, like the quantity of filters or the size of the window and pool length; adjusting these factors can take up an amount of time. 
The paper mainly focuses on comparing the model with existing entity grid models; however including a broader comparison, with other coherence models and neural architectures would add more value.
