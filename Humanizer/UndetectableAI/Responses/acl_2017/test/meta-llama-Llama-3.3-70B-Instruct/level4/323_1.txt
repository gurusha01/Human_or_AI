The study introduces an upgraded entity grid framework that utilizes a neural network to capture the flow of entity transitions that contribute to coherence in a more advanced manner, than the initial models direct calculation of transition probabilities permits. 
This article is organized well. Written in a clear manner while following a reliable approach that builds on previous research and uses a neural network to overcome certain limitations all at once. However it would be helpful to elaborate on the comparison with the neural coherence model presented by Li and Hovy that already exists. The authors being surprised by the score obtained by the Li and Hovy model for their task brings up uncertainties regarding potential mistakes in the experimental design and whether the difference, in performance relies on the specific dataset used. Taking a look, at these aspects would really bolster the arguments strength. 
The paper is easy to read and understand overall; however it seems to be missing some articles in various spots (like lines 92 132 174 488 490 547,674 and 764) which might indicate the necessity, for a thorough proofreading regarding the correct usage of articles. The expression "...restricts the model from performing X..." is often. Could be altered for better clarity to something, like "...constrains the models ability to perform X..." or "...hinders the model from carrying out X...".
After reviewing the authors feedback and input the revised recommendation is to give it a rating of 4. It is fair to acknowledge that facing issues while running software created by others should not be a point, for the authors. The struggles and obstacles faced during the testing of the Li and Hovy system should be detailed in the paper. Furthermore conductinâ€‹g tests to replicate the outcomes of Li and Hovy using their datasets as a validation step (if not already completed) would be advisable to ensure their systems effectiveness.
