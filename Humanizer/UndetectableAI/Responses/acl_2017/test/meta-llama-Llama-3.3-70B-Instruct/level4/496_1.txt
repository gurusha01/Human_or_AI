The authors thoroughly examine language contexts in their research by focusing on how relatedness and morphological complexity impact neural machine translation (NMT) systems performance effectively. They compare translation tasks involving related languages with those that are more distant to highlight the differences. An interesting aspect of the study is the analysis of the systems architectural components and how the attention mechanism affects morphology learning to produce less robust target side representations. The results of this research are not just fascinating. Also offer important practical insights, for the wider NMT community. 
The paper doesn't delve into the specifics of how the character based encoder was implemented in detail which's important considering the various methods available for learning character based representations.This exclusion leads to doubts about how broadly applicable the resultsre.Additionally the analysis could benefit from including languages with intricate and demanding structures, like Turkish or Finnish and carrying out a more intricate forecast and evaluation of morphology. 
This study provides insights into how well NMT models can learn about the structure of words and sentences.Leveraging the information from the encoder or decoder to help with tasks like identifying parts of speech or word forms gives us an understanding of what NMT systems grasp about morphology.This research builds upon studies like "Does String Based Neural MT Learn Source Syntax?‚Äù, by using an approach but focusing specifically on morphology. The findings provide insights, into the learning abilities of NMT systems and emphasize the importance of this research.
