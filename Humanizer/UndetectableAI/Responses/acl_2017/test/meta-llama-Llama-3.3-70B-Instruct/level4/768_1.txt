This study offers an analysis of how context influences lexical entailment tasks using a defined and organized method alongside a comprehensive experimental design and result evaluation.The innovative and relevant concept of integrating context into entailment is highlighted in this paper.  
There are aspects that could use some enhancements; specifically providing more detailed information would be beneficial. For example it would be helpful if the table captions were made descriptive and if a clearer explanation of each word type feature was given to improve comprehension. 
The suggestion to take into account the context in lexical inference tasks is nicely explained in the paper with research findings showing that models incorporating context perform better than those that do not consider it. One commendable aspect of the study is how they create instances for automated negative annotations by using WordNet positive examples in two unique ways.This not aids in forming a fresh dataset but also introduces an intriguing method, for developing datasets. 
Furthermore​ converting representations into contextualized ones using techniques like masking and context embedding and evaluating them on three different data sets illustrate a strong method for ensuring broad applicability, across languages and contexts. 
The reasons for the design decisions are clearly explained; for example the justification for the division employed in CONTEXT_PPDB shows a careful and intentional strategy, in the study. 
To improve the paper more effectively for readers comprehension and comparison with previous studies, in CONTEXT WN experiments it would be helpful for the authors to briefly outline how they arrived at and utilized class weights to tackle the challenge of unbalanced data. 
Minor changes are recommended well; for example replacing "directionality 4" with just "directionality" as shown in Table 4 and updating "is a hierarchy of WordNet" to "'is a’ hierarchy of WordNet" for uniformity purposes Also it would be beneficial to add an illustration of the "mask”, in Figure 1 to enhance the overall comprehensiveness of the display. 
The authors feedback has been carefully. Offers valuable insights into the study at hand. In terms the paper makes a significant contribution to the realm of lexical entailment by focusing on context and introducing new approaches, to creating datasets and testing models.
