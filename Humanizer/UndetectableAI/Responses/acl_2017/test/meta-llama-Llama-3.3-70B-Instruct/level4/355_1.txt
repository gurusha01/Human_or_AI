This study presents an use of Grid type Recurrent Neural Networks to analyze predicate–argument structures (PAS) in Japanese language text, with better effectiveness compared to existing cutting edge models that consider syntactic structure but do not depend on explicit syntactic details. The authors offer an elaborate account of how the model was applied and the outcomes obtained through focusing on complex scenarios involving missing arguments and zero pronouns commonly found in Japanese text. Their multi sequence model stands out by taking into account all predicates in a sentence. Produces the most favorable outcomes, in these instances. The papers lucid explanations and thorough descriptions are assets. 
One of the issues in the paper is the typos that could be fixed to improve the fluency of English writing better. Moreover explaining the PRED concept by providing context around the "predicate " for instance using an example like the one in Figure 6 where the accusative marker is shown along with the verb in the PRED string could help make this point clearer. Additionally the use of boldface in Table 2, on page 7 lacks an explanation. 
When it comes to making corrections, in the text content mentioned earlier on in the document; a few minor tweaks and fixes are needed. For instance;. On the page where "error propagation" using the definite article "the " is unnecessary.. Additionally on that page when referring to "multi predicate interactions " it should not be preceded by "the.". Moving on to page 2 of the document where "As an solution " requires correction to read as "As a solution.". On page 2 when talking about both the "single sequence model " and the "multi sequence model " they should be introduced with the indefinite article "a."In the sample provided in Figure 4 on page 3 there is a mistake where it says "She ate a bread " it should actually be corrected to "She ate bread." On page 4 the phrase "assumes the independence" should be changed to "assumed independence ". The mentions of "the multi predicate interactions" and "the multi sequence model" should be revised to read as "multi predicate interactions" and "a multi sequence model," respectively. On page 7 of the document. The terms "the connections" and the frequent mentions of "the multi predicate interactions" need to be adjusted to "residual connections" and "multi predicate interactions." Additionally. On page 8. "NAIST Text Corpus" should be referred to as "the NAIST Text Corpus " and instead of mentioning "the state of the art result " use "state of the art results.”
After going through the authors reply and considering the clarifications and adjustments made by them I feel content, with the outcome.
