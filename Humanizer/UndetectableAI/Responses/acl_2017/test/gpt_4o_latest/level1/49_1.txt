Lets capture the essence.  
In this paper chunk based decoders for machine translation are presented to tackle the issues related to capturing long distance dependencies and accommodating variable word order in languages with free word order, such, as Japanese.The strategy suggested involves integrating chunk structures into the decoding process through a design comprising a decoder at the chunk level and another at the word level. Three different models are introduced in the study. A decoder that operates based on chunks of information as a foundation; an upgraded version with connections between these chunks; and an even more refined model incorporating feedback from individual words to the larger chunks they belong to within the translation process from English to Japanese in the WAT '16 dataset test scenarios showed that these new models surpassed traditional single NMT structures like tree, to sequence and character driven methods. 
Key Findings  
The article presents a decoding framework that focuses specifically on the hierarchical structure of chunks in the target language. This contribution is important as it deals with dependencies across distances and the flexibility in word order, which are crucial for languages, with free word order.   
The new translation models show progress by delivering top notch outcomes in the WAT '16 English to Japanese translation task compared to previous individual NMT models with gains of up, to +4%.68 BLEUs and +3%.31 RIBES scores. Highlighting the practical value of the chunk based strategy.   
Model 2 features a hierarchical RNN design that boosts memory capacity and minimizes errors in chunk generation by facilitating information exchange, between the word level and chunk level decoders. 
Advantages  
The research paper tackles a void in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) by delving into the framework of the target languageâ€”a domain that has received less attention compared to modeling the structure, on the source side.   
The practical testing confirms the outcomes with continuous enhancements in various measurements like BLEUS and RIBES as well, as showcasing real life examples that underscore the benefits of the suggested models.   
Scalability and Practicality; Utilizing preprocessing tools and steering clear of the need for extra syntactic analysis during real time use makes this method feasible and adaptable, to various languages.   
The document extensively compares with models like tree to sequence and character based NMT to effectively position its contributions, within the larger NMT scene.   
The writers discuss opportunities for expansion, in their work by exploring other languages and integrating it with more sophisticated encoders to boost the papers significance and applicability. 
Areas of improvement  
The research focuses on language but lacks data on languages with free word order such, as Turkish or German which hampers the applicability of the results to a wider context.   
The method depends on chunking tools that might not be accessible, for all languages and may not always be accurate which could potentially restrict its usefulness.   
The hierarchical structure of the design is inventive; however there is no mention in the paper of the burden arising from the chunk level and word level decoders which may pose a challenge, for extensive applications.   
The paper could benefit from thorough ablation studies to better understand the impact of specific components, such as inter chunk connections versus word, to chunk feedback rather than relying solely on qualitative examples. 
Queries, for Writers  
Have you assessed how efficient the suggested models are, in terms of computing power when contrasted with NMT designs?   
How does the chunk based decoders performance change when used with languages such, as Turkish or German that have a free word order structure?   
Can the suggested technique effectively manage chunking tools that're noisy or have limited resources?   
Further Thoughts   
The paper is nicely. Makes a strong argument, for integrating chunk structures into NMT systems.It could enhance its impact and usefulness by addressing the mentioned shortcomings and queries.
