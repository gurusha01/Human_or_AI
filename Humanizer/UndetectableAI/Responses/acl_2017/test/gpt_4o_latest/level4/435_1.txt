This document presents a model using LSTM technology to categorize how connectives are used depending on whether they indicate an intended causal relationship or not.The main idea is that the way causal relationships are expressed can vary greatly and cannot be effectively captured by grammar rules therefore neural models that generate abstract representations are better suited for handling such classification tasks. 
The researchers performed experiments using the dataset created by Hide and McKeown which yielded somewhat consistent findings that support the core concept and offer initial perspectives on its practical implementation, in a model. The study also details the TensorFlow models utilized in the work. 
Here are a few important criticisms and inquiries; 
The way the introduction is structured is different from the approach as it reads more like a summary of previous literature rather than providing a thorough overview of the papers content which overlaps with the subsequent related work section in terms of information repetition and redundancy issues Theres potential for an atypical introduction to be effective; however this particular one misses the mark by discussing multiple concepts without clearly stating its position, on what causation entails or how it manifests Instead of addressing these key points it mainly argues against the notion that causation can be simplified to just syntax. The positive impact is subtly mentioned towards the end of the section without indicating the main contribution of the paper, to the reader. 
The paper doesn't really explain the theory of causation it assumes enough in my opinion.As I see it the authors are inclined towards a view similar to David Lewiss perspective.Which means they believe that causation is essentially a claim of sufficiency with added conditions regarding counterfactuals.This idea becomes apparent around line 238 and, in the following lines where the arrow indicates a kind of implication.However Lewiss theory has some known issues as documented in this source;http;//bcopleywolff2014.com/.Although the paper at times hints that the authors may not completely support the perspective it is still not evident what other theory is being considered. It's not just, about the restriction noted on page 3. 
The feedback about the example mentioned in line 256 seems a bit ambiguous to me.The writers seem to believe that the statement is incorrect as there should be a connection between the argument and the fracture if it were true.However the paper does not delve into the topics of splitting events into smaller parts which are crucial, for understanding causal theories.This absence makes the conversation puzzling and hard to follow. 
The description under Figure 1 is deceptive because it only showcases the "Pair_LSTM" version of the model which may lead to confusion for readers seeking a view of the model variations depicted in the diagram. A broader concern arises from the lack of precision in the diagrams depiction; even though it is acceptable to exclude specifics from the textual descriptions of standard models for brevitys sake or clarity purposes. It is essential for diagrams to maintain consistent meanings throughout their elements to aid comprehension effectively. Questions arise regarding the significance of the circles positioned between the input and "LSMT" boxes – do they represent specific processes or data interactions? Although references are made in text to a look up layer and a Glove layer, within the model architecture – what additional components or connections should be inferred beyond these mentions? How many levels of representation exist in total? Moreover The boxes labeled "Long Short Term Memory (LTSM)" appear to match the final representations directly linked to the layers, above them; however this connection is not clearly illustrated. I suggest updating the diagram to clarify these specifics. 
The sentence at the start of line 480 is unclear because the models mentioned don't necessarily need padding by default. If padding is needed for compatibility or for better training efficiency it should be clearly mentioned. However the last part of the sentence is confusing. How does this problem tie in with determining "the method to encode causal significance"? The link, between convenience and causal significance isn't clear. 
The researchers discovered that utilizing two LSTMs ("Stated_LSTM") yields slightly superior results compared to a configuration in which one LSTM inputs into the other LSTM model directly.This observation aligns with conversations in the field of language entailment studies wherein scholars discuss the merits of representing the premise and hypothesis either independently or sequentially This aspect continues to be a topic of ongoing inquiry, within entailment research and may necessitate additional investigation particularly in the context of causal relationships. Hence why I cannot entirely support the statement made on line 587 that suggests encoding each argument and then evaluating their relationship using dense layers is superior due to the lack of alignment, between the meanings of the input events; considering that different parts of a sentence frequently convey similar information. 
Its challenging to understand the hyperparameters that result in the performance for different tasks when you look at line 578 and compare it with line 636.Should we attribute these variations to unpredictable interactions between the model and the data or is there a more profound reason, behind them?"
Section 4 point 3 ends by stating that the system is able to distinguish the interpretation of 'which then' accurately compared to the Hidey and McKeown models inability to do so. While this argument may hold true to some extent; relying on one example isn't enough evidence to support it convincingly. To reinforce this argument effectively and validate its accuracy further; I suggest showcasing a range of examples that highlight this ambiguity and then assessing how consistently the system delivers correct outcomes. This approach would shed light on whether the systems success, in Table 8 was purely coincidental or not.
