Clearly explained account of how they applied the method and the outcomes they achieved. They specifically address the problem of missing arguments in sentences known as zero pronouns in Japanese language that can be quite challenging, for PAS tasks to handle effectively.They have developed a sequence model that takes into account all predicates in a sentence and shows exceptional results in handling these tricky instances.This paper is thorough and well explained overall.   
"Areas, for improvement;"  
My feedback mainly consists of suggestions to improve the fluency of the paper by correcting a few typos listed below. Furthermore it would be beneficial to provide explanation regarding the inclusion of context around the "predicate" within the PRED string using the example illustrated in Figure 6 where the accusative marker is integrated with the verb, in the PRED string. Moreover the utilization of boldface formatting in Table 2 (on page 7) seems ambiguous. Could use some clarification.   
Lets talk about some topics.  
Typos have been detected in the text.  
On page one "error propagation'' doesn't need "the ''. Neither do "multi predicate interactions.''  
On page 2 change "As an solution " to "As a solution " substitute "single sequence model " with " a single sequence model ". Replace "multi sequence model " with " a multi sequence model."   
On page 3 there is an example shown in Figure 4 where it says "She ate a bread." The correct version would be "She ate bread."  
On page 4 it is stated that there is an independence, along with discussions, on multi predicate interactions and the use of a multi sequence model.  
On page 7 there are references, to " connections " and the term "multi predicate interactions" is mentioned twice.  
On page 8 of the document the NAIST Text Corpus is referenced as a resource. It showcases state of the art results in the field.  
After examining the authorsâ€™ reply I am content, with it.
