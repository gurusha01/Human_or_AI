The article introduces a method to improve the entity grid model by integrating a convolutional neural network to understand patterns of entity transitions that demonstrate coherence. This strategy allows for adaptation, across extended sequences of entities when compared to the basic transition probability estimates utilized in the initial model. 
This paper is nicely. Clearly written out! Of suggesting an all out neural solution, like some might do immediately off the bat; the authors here actually build on whats already out there and use a neural network to tackle some specific shortcomings in one part of the process they're improving on. It makes sense to take this route. It could be even better if they took a deeper dive into comparing it with Li and Hovys neural coherence model as well. The writers express their astonishment at the poor results of the Li and Hovy model in their study task which leads them to ponder if there could have been a mistake in the way the experiment was conducted or if the low performance is specific, to the dataset used; furthermore they wonder how well their model would fare in a scenario where the Li and Hovy model typically performs well.The papers argument would be greatly enhanced by delving into these considerations. 
The paper is nicely written and clear to understand; however there are a few places where it seems like some definite articles are missing (, for example; at line 92). I suggest going through the paper again with a focus to check for article usage errors in order to improve it further. Also the phrase "...limits the model to do X..." occurs frequently. May sound a bit odd. Using phrases like "restricts the models ability to perform X" or "hinders the model from executing X" could be easily understood. 
I'm afraid I can't comply with that request.
The final recommendation was changed to 4 after reviewing the authors’ response.I concur that obstacles faced in using third party software shouldn’t be a strike, against the authors.However the challenges experienced during testing of the Li and Hovy system should be included in the paper.In addition I suggest that the authors try replicating the outcomes of Li and Hovy using their datasets as a sanity check (if not done already) to confirm if the system functions as anticipated in its initial setting.
