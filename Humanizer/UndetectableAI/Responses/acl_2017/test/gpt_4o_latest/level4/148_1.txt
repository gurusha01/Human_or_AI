Advantages; 
This paper connects two areas of study. Making text easy to read for humans and helping machines understand texts better. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The main goal of the paper isn't clearly stated; after reading it several times I still find it hard to understand its central idea.   
The documents focus is unclear as it shifts back and forth between machine understanding and the readability of human written text.   
One notable absence in the reference list is the previous research done on readability, in this field.   
Section 3 delves, into some aspects that may not be completely related to the main discussion.   
The article tries to address questions at once which reduces its overall effectiveness.For example the impact of text readability, on RC datasets should be examined separately from prerequisite skills.  
Lets talk about topics.
The title could be more precise by mentioning that it pertains to how machines understand text since phrases, like "reading comprehension" and "readability" usually refer to human understanding of text.   
"The assertion that the analysis of datasets indicates that the readability of reading comprehension datasets does not have an impact on the complexity of questions depends on the approach or characteristics utilized for identifying answers, like parts of speech or dependency parsing features."   
The document needs a check for errors, in language usage since there are notable issues present; for instance on the first page where the phrase "solving the question is straightforward. Just look..." appears incompletely structured.   
The explanation of how datasetsre annotated with "metrics" lacks clarity.   
The article mixes up machine reading comprehension with reading comprehension even though they are related fields, with significant variations.   
The concept of "text readability' doesn't mean the same as the complexity of reading material.' To understand this better you can look at DuBays work "The Principles of Readability " published in 2004 by Impact Information, in Costa Mesa,Caliornia.   
The paper could use some improvement in distinguishing between its content and how easy the questions are for people to understand since the current explanation is quite unclear. For example; In the page when it says "These two examples show that how easy it is to read the text does not always match how hard the questions are " it should clarify that this is about understanding, by machines.   
Section 3 of the document also brings up some questions about whether the skills being talked about're meant for humans or machines specifically. If the emphasiss more towards machines, in this context why are studies centered around humans being referenced and how certain are you that such studies can be applied to machines effectively?   
Did the annotators specifically assess the questions with a focus on machines, than humans and how many questions were marked for evaluation?
