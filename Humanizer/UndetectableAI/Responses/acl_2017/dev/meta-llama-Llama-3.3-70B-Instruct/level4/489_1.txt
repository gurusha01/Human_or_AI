I will rephrase my text to sound human like. Thank you for your input. 
The authors’ response was insightful. I especially appreciated their clarification on the hypothesis mentioned in the paper.I agree with their point about modal mapping but I have a different view on the equation they suggested. "Visual equals referential." While a referent can be visually displayed to aid understanding a words visual features can also be. Included in its representation to capture its perceptual characteristics. Similar, to how we process textual information. Rarely do we mention that bananas are yellow in text; however by including details from images we can capture this aspect of the words meaning. While this is a matter in constructing distributional models it also relates to human thinking. Our mental picture of "banana" probably combines input from different experiences. I recommend that the writers specifically address this topic and differentiate, between modal distributional semantics and the practice of cross modal mapping. 
In reference to the statement "all models perform similarly " I highly recommend that the authors clearly mention this in their paper—regardless of whether it matches their hypotheses or objectives entirely. This direct acknowledgment provides a precise and beneficial explanation of the findings for the scientific community instead of delving into minor distinctions among models. The importance of these disparities statistical significance pales in comparison to their real world consequences—a point exemplified by comparing two bridges, with varying probabilities of collapse. 
I suggest you consider choosing an more descriptive title that accurately captures the essence of your papers research or discoveries. 
The study delves into the idea of "referential word meaning," which pertains to how a words meaning relates to the real world objects it signifies externally. The writers posit that this differs from word meaning representations derived from distributional techniques since it encompasses the link between a words general "lexical meaning" and the distinct characteristics of the referent, within a specific context. This theory has been previously investigated in research conducted by Schlangen and his peers. 
"Advantages;"
The issue explored in the paper is quite fascinating and the authors should be praised for utilizing up to date methods and datasets to tackle it successfully.The research goes beyond REG to delve into the wider connection, between semantic representations and reference. 
The research paper utilizes methods and datasets like cross modal mapping and word classifiers as well, as the ReferIt dataset to explore the issue at hand. 
The researchers perform an amount of experiments and analyses. 
Shortcomings; 
The primary issue lies in the clarity of the hypothesis statement; I found it unclear and difficult to grasp its connection to the results obtained from experiments, with differing outcomes. 
The article applies existing techniques to a dataset that was already accessible before this study was conducted which hinders its uniqueness. 
The writers chose a portion of the ReferIt dataset comprising only 159 words without providing a clear rationale, for their selection. 
The paper could use some clarity, in areas and the way the empirical results and analyses are presented could be improved for better coherence. 
The paper presents experiments and analyses; however it is challenging to grasp the big picture and understand how the various components interact with each other. 
Lets talk about topics.
While there are some shortcomings in the papers argumentation style and structure flow that could be improved upon to enhance clarity and coherence I believe the subject matter is both timely and innovative.It offers a perspective by applying modern methodologies to tackle a longstanding issue.The research findings and assessments provide insights and advancements in the field of study; however I do feel that there is room, for a more cohesive explanation of how these findings directly relate to the core research inquiry. 
Your comments are very thorough and informative.
In Section 2 of the document lacks any mentions of semantic methods for referencing work like those presented by Abjheet Gupta and collaborating authors along with the research, by Aurelie Herbelot and Eva Maria Vecchi. 
The paper would be improved by explaining how Roys research expands on the REG studies and offering additional background information on the connections, between different sections. 
In Section 3 of the papers presentation of data figures in a table should include image areas along with counts, for RE occurrences and total words used in both the ReferIt dataset and the modified version referenced in the study; additionally releasing their dataset is advised by the authors. 
The document has a small mistakes and statements that are not very clear; for example; the explanation of "the semantically annotated portion" in ReferIt and the reason, for selecting a limited subset of the dataset. 
The writers ought to offer information, about the characteristics employed in the trials by elaborating on the seven features included and explaining how they were extracted. 
The results and discussion sections could benefit from an exploration of the statistical significance related to the variations among models along, with offering greater understanding into the phenomenon and the models themselves. 
The structure of the document known as the "WAC" and how the findings are displayed in Table 3 could use some enhancements to make them clearer and easier to understand. 
Section 6 of the task seems a bit unclear; providing an example would make it easier to understand the concept. 
The study could see improvements by incorporating a blend of training examples featuring categories alongside specific categories and leveraging additional insights, from the ReferIt dataset before progressing to different datasets.
