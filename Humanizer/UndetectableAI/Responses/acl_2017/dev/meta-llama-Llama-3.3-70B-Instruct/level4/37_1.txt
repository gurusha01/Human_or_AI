Advantages; 
The suggested method is clearly outlined in regards, to its context and organization while the mathematical elements are well detailed and easy to follow. Moreover Additionally the writers offer an evaluation comparing it extensively with various other systems available. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The findings and overview of the comparison between humans, in Section 5 are a bit disappointing overall there are also some instances of stutter and grammatical issues scattered throughout the content. 
Lets chat, about a few things; 
This article presents an approach, to capturing the context of speech by considering a series of previous statements made in conversation; nevertheless 
It would improve the clarity of the text in Table 1 by numbering the actions listed there (lines 095–103). This way readers won't have to count the turns from the beginning each time they refer back to what the authors wrote about a turn – this can prevent confusion about whether "second " "third," and "last" refer, to a specific side or overall count. 
It would be helpful to clearly explain what "segment level" means in line 269 to avoid readers as it seems to be associated with "sequence sequence [similarity matrix]" in line 129 but lacks a definitive explanation despite the details provided in section 3. It appears that the writers could be talking about "word sequences within words " and "word sequences within word sequences " with the prefix "sub " indicating a portion of the statement, than the whole statement; however further explanation is required. 
The symbol "m," when applied in sentences (line 306) and dialogues (line 389) can be perplex for readers as it serves a purpose in this context. To enhance clarity and avoid confusion among readers of the equations provided by the authors should consider utilizing letters, for these distinct purposes. 
At the conclusion of section 5 in the text is a statement suggesting that a retrieval based chatbot with SMN may offer an user experience compared to the latest generation model currently available in real world scenarios; however this assertion lacks adequate support and clarity. Since both approaches are considered to be similar in 555 instances out of 1000 cases examined. The baseline outperforms the proposed method in 238 cases, among the remaining 445 instances evaluated; henceforth the authors should thoroughly evaluate and present the statistical significance of this comparison. If the similarity is not strong enough all they can state is that their suggested approach is not inferior, to the VHRED baseline; they cannot assert it is better. 
Adding labels like "initial layer " "subsequent layer " and "final layer”, to the diagram shown in Figure 1 as referenced in the text alongside it would enhance its comprehensibility. 
The frequent use of the term "to meet " such as, in the context of "each utterance can satisfy a response candidate " as mentioned in line 280 can be confusing. Might need to be rephrased to improve understanding. 
Several slight mistakes were identified in the text; spelling errors like " recurrent units " extra words such as "respectively" in line 133; punctuation mistakes in lines 186 and 188 and grammatical errors like "baseline model, over" instead of "baseline model​ ​by" and the incorrect use of "one cannot neglect.”
