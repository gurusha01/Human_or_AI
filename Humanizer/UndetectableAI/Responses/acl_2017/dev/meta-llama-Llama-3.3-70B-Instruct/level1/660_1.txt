This study introduces two approaches, for creating rhythmic poetry in different styles automatically outlining the key advancements of this research work as follows; 
A neural language model was trained on a representation of poetry to understand both its structure and meaning implicitly. 
A structured character based model follows a step, by step method that merges a language model with a judgmental model to convey structure effectively for shaping the style of crafted poems. 
Evaluation Approach; Conduct a real world assessment to showcase how well the suggested models perform in creating top notch rhythmic poetry. 
The positive aspects of this paper include; 
A fresh perspective is taken with the utilization of encoding and restricted character level models for crafting poetry offering a novel and creative approach, to the art form. 
The poetry produced is top notch; 54 percent of individuals perceive the machine created poems, as human authored works of art. 
Flexibility is enhanced with the character level model limitation as it provides influence over the style of generated poems such, as themes and poetic elements. 
The evaluation method is well thought out. Offers a comprehensive review of the suggested models. 
Comparing the generated poetry to poetry serves as a helpful standard, for assessing its quality. 
The shortcomings of this document include; 
The phonetic level model has a capacity to adapt to new verse forms due, to its limited generalizability. 
Transliteration mistakes are common, in the phonetic level model. Can impact the overall quality of the poetry produced. 
The quality of the poetry produced is determined by the quality of the data used for training purposes. 
The neural language models utilized in this paper may pose a challenge, in terms of interpretability as they can be hard to decipher and comprehend when it comes to understanding the rationale behind the creation of poetry instances. 
The examination of the outcomes is restricted in scope; a thorough analysis could offer additional perspectives on the merits and shortcomings of the suggested models. 
Queries, for writers; 
What methods do the suggested models use to deal with words that're not, in their vocabulary and how can we enhance their ability to manage such words effectively? 
Can the restricted character level model be applied to create poems in languages, than English and what changes need to be made for this to work effectively? 
How do the new models stack up against cutting edge poetry generation models and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each method?
