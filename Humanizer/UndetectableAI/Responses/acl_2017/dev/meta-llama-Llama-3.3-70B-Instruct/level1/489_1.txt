This article offers an analysis of three approaches, for connecting visual object descriptions to word meanings in a vector space based model framework.  
The writers. Assess three various approaches for understanding the meaning of words in context; direct connections between different modes of representation (cross modal mapping) associating words with meanings using separate word classifiers (lexical mapping) and predicting words based on similarities, across different modes of representation (cross modal similarity mapping).
The researchers show that when these models are combined together it can enhance results in regular and zero shot object naming activities indicating they cover aspects of the meaning of words used for reference. 
The writers thoroughly examine the pros and cons of each model by assessing how well they can categorize object names accurately and identify word examples while also being able to apply their learnings to new words effectively. 
The merits of this document are;  
The writers extensively examine research on the meanings of referential words and naming objects, in their field while discussing the shortcomings of past methods and underscoring the advancements made in their own study. 
The researchers test their models on tasks such, as typical and zero shot object identification and offer a thorough examination of the outcomes with illustrations and numerical measurements included. 
The authors show how their method can be used in scenarios like creating descriptive phrases and interacting with people, in conversations. 
The shortcomings of this document are;  
The researchers’ assessment is confined to a restricted range of words and data points that could potentially restrict the broader applicability of their findings. 
The authors have not thoroughly compared their method to advanced techniques, for naming objects and generating referring expressions. 
The authors mainly discuss the outcomes qualitatively. Suggest enhancing the analysis, with additional quantitative metrics and statistical examination. 
Queries, for writers;  
How do the writers intend to expand their method to accommodate vocabularies and datasets while considering the challenges they might face in the process? 
How do the authors’ models stack up against cutting edge techniques, for naming objects and generating referring expressions—and what sets their approach apart in terms of key variances and benefits? 
What other methods and assessments could be employed to show effectively how well the authors’ approach works and how strong it is?
