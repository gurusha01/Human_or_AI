This research paper introduces a method, for analyzing sentiments at the sentence level by integrating linguistic understanding into Long Short Term Memory (LSMT). The key highlights of this study include; 
The authors suggest a impactful method to capture the linguistic impact of sentiment words related to feelings and intensity, in classifying sentiment at the sentence level by introducing four types of regularizers – Non Sentiment Regularizer (NSR) Sentiment Regularizer (SR) Negation Regularizer (NR) and Intensity Regularizer (IR).
The new models put forward are sequence LSTMs which're more efficient and straightforward compared to older models that depend heavily on parsing trees and costly phrase level annotation requirements. 
The authors show that their models have achieved top notch results on two known datasets. Movie Review (MR ) and Stanford Sentiment Treebank ( SST ). They have outperformed baseline models such, as Tree LSTM, CNN and DAN. 
The paper’s strong points include; 
The writers have done a job of integrating linguistic knowledge into their models to enhance their performance in sentiment classification tasks. 
The models put forward are straightforward and effective compared to versions which make them better suited for practical use, in real life scenarios. 
The authors showcase the success of their models by achieving top notch results on two known datasets. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
Limited Examination of Negation and Intensity Words; Although the authors suggest ways to handle negation and intensity words, in their work they do not thoroughly explore the significance of these words in expressing sentiment. 
The writers did not specifically consider the range of changes caused by negation and intensity words, in their model; this oversight may result in inaccuracies when categorizing sentiments. 
The authors have only tested their models on two datasets. May not have considered the diversity of other datasets or fields, for evaluation purposes. 
Inquiries, for Writers; 
How do the authors intend to expand their models to incorporate the aspects of negation and intensity words in a more explicit manner? 
Could the writers offer explanations on how negation and words emphasizing intensity play a role, in expressing sentiments linguistically and how their regularization methods account for these impacts? 
How do the writers intend to test their models, on datasets and areas to show how well they can adapt?
