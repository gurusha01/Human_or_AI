This paper presents UDEPLAMBDA as an interface, for Universal Dependencies (UD) which translates natural language into logical forms with a near language independent approach.The key advancements of this study include; 
A multilingual semantic interface called UDEPLAMBDA has been created to work alongside UD language data using an annotation scheme, across different languages This enables the creation of a semantic interface that can be used across various languages efficiently. 
The authors expand on the DEPLAMBDA framework created for English Stanford Dependencies to make it compatible, with Universal Dependencies (UD) allowing the semantic interface to be utilized across an array of languages. 
The writers assess UDEPLAMBDAs performance in parsing for answering questions using Freebase across English and Spanish languages as well as German to showcase the methods success, in a diverse linguistic environment. 
The papers notable attributes are; 
The writers showcase a way of using Universal Dependencies in semantic parsing by highlighting the advantages of a uniform annotation approach, across different languages. 
Impressive evaluation outcomes are noted by the authors in the realm of parsing for question answering; they surpass solid benchmarks and attain top notch performance, on GraphQuestions. 
The authors offer translations of datasets in German and Spanish to enable the assessment of UDEPLAMBDA in a multilingual context and encourage more exploration, in this field. 
The paper has some shortcomings, such, as; 
The authors recognize that UDEPLAMBDA may not fully grasp language structures like dropping pronouns or using idiomatic expressions which could affect the accuracy of the semantic interface. 
The writers mention that the effectiveness of UDEPLAMBDA relies on how precise the syntactic parser's this can differ between languages and datasets. 
The writers recognize that UDEPLAMBDA may not address every aspect like quantifiers and negation; thus necessitating extra tweaks to the framework, for intentional verbs and other phenomena. 
Queries for the writers; 
What are the authors strategies, for handling language structures and idiomatic expressions in upcoming research endeavors? 
Could the writers give information, about how the entity resolution algorithm works and how well it performs in different languages? 
How do the writers plan to use UDEPLAMBDA in areas of natural language comprehension, like summarizing and translating text?
