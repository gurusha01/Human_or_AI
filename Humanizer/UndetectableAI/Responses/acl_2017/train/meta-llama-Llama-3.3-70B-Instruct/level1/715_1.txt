This study introduces a tool called DrWiki that aims to answer questions from domains by utilizing Wikipedia as the primary source of information.The tool integrates a feature for retrieving documents with a model for understanding machines to pinpoint information, in pertinent articles.  
The primary achievements of this study include;  
Creating a document retrieval system that surpasses the default search engine, in Wikipedias capabilities has been a major achievement.  
A cutting edge model for machine comprehension called the Document Reader has been able to deliver performance, on the SQuAD benchmark.  
Illustrating the efficacy of multitask learning through supervision across various question answering datasets. 
The papers notable aspects are as follows;  
The authors extensively tested their system on benchmarks to showcase the effectiveness of their approach.  
Creating a system that can respond to a range of questions using just one source of knowledge poses a significant challenge.  
Using supervision to create more training data can enhance the systems performance significantly.  
The writers pinpoint the major obstacles, in open domain question answering like combining search and machine understanding. 
The limitations of this document are as follows;  
The systems effectiveness in answering questions is not as advanced, as that of unrestricted question and answer systems that utilize excess resources.  
Sometimes the document retrieval system may not find the document accurately and this could result in incorrect matches and false positives.  
The systems results, on WebQuestions are not as good as we hoped for probably because this dataset relies on Freebase and 
The writers did not delve into an examination of the systems mistakes that could offer valuable insights, for enhancing it in the future. 
Questions, for writers;  
How are the writers intending to enhance the effectiveness of the document retrieval feature in order to minimize matches?  
Could the writers offer information about the method of distant supervision and its impact, on enhancing the systems efficiency?  
How do the writers intend to integrate the feature of Document Reader compiling information from paragraphs and documents directly into the training process?  
Could the writers offer an assessment of the mistakes made by the system to pinpoint areas for potential enhancements, in the future?
