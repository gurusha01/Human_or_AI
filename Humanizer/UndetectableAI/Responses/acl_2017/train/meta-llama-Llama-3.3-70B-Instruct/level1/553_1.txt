In this document we introduce an approach to studying word meanings and interpretations across different contexts called cross context lexical analysis (CCLA). The framework can adapt to context types and includes options, for similarity metrics and word notes. 
The key findings of this study are; 
The authors suggest a framework for CCLA that can be used across different tasks such, as identifying semantic changes and evaluating the stability of word embeddings through comparative lexical analysis. 
The framework offers the flexibility to define context in ways like time periods and locations or metadata attributes which makes it suitable, for a broad spectrum of uses. 
The writers show how CCLA can be applied to compare word embeddings acquired from contexts to determine words, with consistent or evolving meanings. 
The positive aspects of this article are; 
A new approach is introduced in the field of natural language processing with the proposed framework that offers an broad method for analyzing words, across different contexts. 
The authors performed a range of experiments to showcase how effective CCLA is in different tasks such, as detecting semantic changes and evaluating the stability of word embeddings. 
The paper thoroughly compares CCLA with methods and emphasizes its benefits and possible uses, in different scenarios. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The evaluation methods used by the authors for CCLA focus on word similarity and analogy tasks but may not fully showcase its capabilities due, to their limited scope. 
The paper could improve by conducting a theoretical analysis of the framework and its properties to gain a better grasp of its strengths and weaknesses. 
The efficiency of computation is not addressed by the authors when it comes to CCLA; this is an aspect to consider for applications, on a large scale. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand CCLA to manage context definitions, like hierarchical or graph based contexts? 
Can the writers give information about how efficient CCLA is, in terms of computation and how it can be used in practical situations? 
How do the writers plan to deal with the problem of vocabulary when analyzing word representations, in varying situations?
