This study introduces a method for tagging and linking names across 282 languages found in Wikipedia using a language framework approach. The approach involves creating annotations referred to as "silver standard annotations." These annotations are transferred from English to languages, through cross language connections and database properties. To enhance the annotations accuracy and quality further; 1) Self training techniques are applied. 2) Topics are carefully selected. 3) Language specific morphology features are derived from anchor links. 4) Word translation pairs are identified through language connections. 
The primary achievements of this study entail; 
A comprehensive framework, for language name tagging and linking has been created on a large scale involving 282 languages. The most extensive range of languages ever tackled for this purpose. 
The authors suggest a technique, for creating "standard" annotations by transferring annotations from English to different languages using cross language connections and KB properties. 
Introducing an approach to analyzing morphology in languages with complex structures; the researchers extract language specific morphology characteristics from anchor links to enhance the accuracy of name labeling, in such languages. 
The positive aspects of this project include; 
The framework undergoes testing on Wikipedia articles as well as various formal and informal texts, from external sources to showcase its efficiency. 
The method used by the authors surpasses the performance of techniques, on various language data sets. 
The authors make resources for all 282 languages such, as name tagging and linking annotations labeled as "silver standard " morphology analyzers and a comprehensive name tagging and linking system. 
The shortcomings of this project include; 
Limited assessment of languages with resources exists in the frameworks application to 282 languages; however the evaluation is confined to a select few languages, for which gold standard data is accessible. 
The system heavily depends on information from Wikipedia sources which may not always be accessible nor trustworthy, for all languages. 
The authors have not included a comparison, to supervised methods that utilize manually annotated data to evaluate their approach comprehensively. 
Questions, for writers; 
How are the writers intending to tackle the problem of assessment in languages, with limited resources? 
Could the writers offer information on how they analyze morphology and its impact, on various languages? 
How do the writers intend to expand the structure to handle tasks in information extraction, like relation extraction?
