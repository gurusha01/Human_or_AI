This study thoroughly explores context types and ways to represent word embeddings for learning purposes. The researchers assess how context types (linear and dependency based) as well as representations (unbound and bound) impact a range of tasks such as word similarity assessment and part of speech tagging. They also analyze their effects on chunking activities along, with named entity recognition and text classification tasks. 
The key highlights of this study are; 
Comparing types and ways of presenting contexts for developing word embeddings offers valuable perspectives on the pros and cons of each approach. 
Introducing a toolkit called wordvecPM that simplifies the application and testing of diverse word embedding models using different context types and representations. 
Evaluating word embedding models across tasks such as analyzing intrinsic properties and performing sequence labeling and text classification highlights the significance of context representations, in the learning process of word embeddings. 
The advantages of this document are; 
The detailed and methodical assessment of types of contexts and representations offers a comprehensive insight into how they impact word embedding models. 
The application of tasks to assess the effectiveness of word embedding models highlights the significance of context representations, in diverse scenarios. 
The unveiling of a toolset called word vector PM that is set to support additional exploration, in this field. 
The shortcomings of this document are; 
There is uncertainty about the context type and representation for training word embeddings due to differing outcomes, in various tasks. 
The word embedding tool called wordvecPM has undergone minimal evaluation so far and might need additional testing and validation procedures to ensure its reliability and effectiveness. 
In models there is a risk of either overfitting or underfitting which could impact the accuracy of the outcomes.
