This study introduces a method for relation extraction by framing it as a reading comprehension challenge instead of a conventional task approach where each relation is linked to a series of everyday language queries and addressed using a reading comprehension tool to derive the relationship, between them effectively and efficiently The key achievements highlighted in this research include; 
The authors demonstrate that relation extraction can be simplified to a reading comprehension task by utilizing reading comprehension models and methods. 
The authors showcase how their method can adapt to connections without prior exposure, to them which enables zero shot learning and decreases the reliance on massive volumes of labeled training data. 
The researchers generated a dataset comprising more, than 30 million instances of questions accompanied by sentences and answers through crowdsourcing to train and assess reading comprehension models. 
The key advantages of this document include; 
A fresh perspective is introduced by the authors as they suggest a method, for relation extraction that could enhance the current standards in this field. 
The authors perform experiments to assess their method thoroughly by conducting tests, on entities that have not been previously seen as well as using question templates and relations that are unfamiliar. 
The authors have developed a dataset for researchers to utilize in training and assessing their models on a large scale. 
The paper has shortcomings that need to be addressed.
The authors carry out experiments but limit their evaluation to a single dataset (WikiReading) without comparing their approach, to other advanced relation extraction models. 
The authors fail to offer an, in depth examination of the mistakes made by their model; this analysis could offer insights into ways to enhance it. 
The authors heavily rely on the reading comprehension models accuracy, in their approach. Acknowledge that it may not always be reliable. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the authors aim to enhance the precision of their model when it falls short in cases where the reading comprehension model's inaccurate? 
Could the writers offer information about how they utilized crowdsourcing to develop the extensive dataset and also share insights, on the expenses and time involved in its creation? 
How do the writers intend to test their method on datasets and measure its performance against other advanced models, for extracting relationships?
