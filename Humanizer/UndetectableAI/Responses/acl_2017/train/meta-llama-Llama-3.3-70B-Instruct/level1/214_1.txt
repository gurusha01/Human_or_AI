This study suggests a combined micro discourse structure framework that incorporates the primary secondary connection, at both large and small scales.The key advancements of this research include; 
The authors suggest a way of representing discourse structures by combining both the micro and macro elements to offer a deeper insight into discourse analysis. 
The researchers have labeled 97 news articles with information on small scale meaning and larger communication strategies to form a Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank (MCDBT) providing a useful tool, for analyzing discourse structures. 
The authors conduct experiments, on identifying discourse relationships and primary secondary relationships to assess the utility of their dataset and representation method in two tasks with encouraging outcomes. 
The positive aspects of this document are; 
The new framework for representing ideas. The micro unified discourse structure representation schema. Is a valuable addition, to the discipline since it offers a deeper insight into discourse analysis. 
The establishment of the MCDTB is an asset to the field since it offers an extensive annotated corpus, for analyzing discourse structures on a large scale. 
Preliminary tests show promise in recognizing discourse relations and secondary relations indicating that the proposed representation schema and corpus resource are effective. 
The paper has its drawbacks, which include; 
The study mainly examines news wire articles which could restrict the applicability of the findings to genres or fields. 
Subjective marking may introduce discrepancies and prejudices into the corpus due, to its nature. 
The uneven distribution of data can impact how well models perform in tasks. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the matter of annotation and maintain uniformity, in the corpus? 
Can the authors offer information on the annotation methods and rules employed in developing the MCDTB? 
What are the authors strategies, for expanding the size of the dataset and investigating communication patterns in upcoming research endeavors?
