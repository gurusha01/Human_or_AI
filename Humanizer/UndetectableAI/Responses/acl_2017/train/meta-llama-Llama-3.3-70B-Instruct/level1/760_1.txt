This study introduces a method, for reading text in a non linear manner through the utilization of a recurrent neural network (named RNN) which is trained to skip over unimportant details effectively. The key highlights of this research include; 
The writers suggest a system that can read text in a linear way to skip unnecessary details and concentrate on the key information, within the text. 
The model undergoes training using a reinforcement learning algorithm known as the REINFORCE algorithm to learn a strategy, for navigating text by jumping over it. 
The researchers show that their LSTM Jump model can enhance speed and precision compared to sequential RNN models without compromising accuracy or even enhancing it. 
The notable aspects of this paper are its strengths; 
A fresh perspective is introduced with the concept of reading text in a linear manner offering opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of various tasks, in natural language processing. 
The authors present a range of experimental findings, on four distinct tasks to showcase the efficiency of their method. 
The article is nicely. Presented in a clear and easy to understand manner, for readers of various backgrounds to comprehend easily. 
The papers shortcomings are evident, in the following aspects; 
Limited transparency issue exists in terms of interpretability as the authors have not delved deeply into explaining the rationale behind the models decision making process when it comes to making jumps – an aspect that could be ripe for exploration, in research endeavors. 
The models effectiveness is influenced by the hyperparameters chosen – like the number of jumps and the maximum jumping size. 
The authors mainly contrast their model with a sequential RNN; however it would be intriguing to observe comparisons with other models that also strive to enhance efficiency, like those utilizing attention mechanisms. 
Queries, for writers; 
Could you offer explanation regarding how the model decides when to make its transitions and which aspects of the text are crucial, in deciding when to transition? 
How do you intend to expand on this project to tackle intricate challenges that involve multiple readings of the text or advanced cognitive processes? 
Have you thought about trying out reinforcement learning strategies or approaches, like actor critic methods or curriculum learning to enhance the models efficiency?
