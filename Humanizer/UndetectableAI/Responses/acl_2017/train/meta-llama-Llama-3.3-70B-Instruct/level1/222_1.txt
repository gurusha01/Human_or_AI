This research paper suggests a tagging approach to extract entities and relationships simultaneously from unstructured text data sets.The authors present a method that transforms the combined extraction task into a tagging challenge enabling the application of end, to end models to extract entities and relationships directly. The paper states three contributions. A new labeling system; exploration of various end to end models using this system; and the creation of an end to end model, with a tailored objective function to align with the new labels. 
The primary achievements of this study are listed in descending order of impact; 
The suggested labeling system effectively changes the combined extraction task into a challenge that allows the utilization of end, to end models. 
A new model has been created that focuses on connecting entities more effectively using a targeted objective function throughout the entire process. 
The results from the experiment show that the suggested approach is effective and has achieved performance on the dataset available, to the public. 
The positive aspects of this entry are; 
The uniqueness of the labeling system offers an approach, to the task of extracting information jointly. 
The extensive testing conducted compares the suggested approach, with baseline methods and offers a comprehensive analysis of the outcomes. 
The proposed techniques efficiency, in attaining top notch outcomes on the dataset is noteworthy. 
The flaws, in this submission are; 
The proposed method is limited to overlapping relations and may not be ideal, for all real world scenarios. 
Rely on supervision could lead to errors, in the training data. 
There needs to be a thorough examination of the bias objective function to grasp its complete influence, on the outcomes better. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do you intend to tackle the challenge posed by the lack of overlapping relationships, in your projects? 
Could you please elaborate further on how the bias objective function influences the outcomes? 
How do you believe the suggested approach could be utilized in NLP tasks like answering questions or categorizing texts?
