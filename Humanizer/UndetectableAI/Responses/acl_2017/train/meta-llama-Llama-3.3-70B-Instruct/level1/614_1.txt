This study suggests an approach to enhance the ranking of word replacements, in current models by incorporating word sense inventories into the process.The researchers introduce a view clustering technique that combines various perspectives of paraphrase similarity to create sense clusters that offer more substitution options and broader scope compared to current sense inventories. 
The key achievements of this study include; 
A fresh approach, to grouping paraphrases based on word meanings bringing together ways of expressing similar ideas through multiple viewpoints. 
The addition  metric. The extended B Cubed F Score. To evaluate the effectiveness sense lists is a significant development. 
Using word meanings as a filter, on lexsub rankings generated automatically could enhance their alignment with substitutions annotated by humans.The demonstration shows this improvement in agreement. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The new approach surpasses sense inventories, in its ability to be substituted and its range. 
Utilizing a view clustering technique enables the integration of various forms of data, on paraphrases which enhances the methods resilience and adaptability. 
The method was tested on a dataset (CoInCo) and when compared with cutting edge models its effectiveness was clearly demonstrated. 
The shortcomings of this document are; 
The success of the approach hinges, on the effectiveness of the input rephrasings and the precision of determining word meanings. 
Using a method, for clarifying word meanings could create bias and constrain the effectiveness of the strategy. 
In the experiments conducted to test its effectiveness it was found that the approach might not yield results when dealing with nouns and could benefit from optimization tailored to specific parts of speech. 
Authors are often posed with inquiries; 
How do the writers intend to overcome the methods shortcomings regarding nouns and enhance its effectiveness, for this part of speech? 
Could the authors offer information regarding how the multi view clustering algorithm was implemented and the rationale, behind selecting the parameters? 
How do the writers intend to expand the approach to cover languages and fields and what obstacles and constraints might arise in this expansion?
