The research paper suggests an encoding approach for creating concise summaries of sentences by expanding the sequence to sequence structure with a selective gate network to regulate the transfer of information, between the encoder and decoder sections.The key advancements of this study include; 
The suggested model incorporates a gate network to sift through unneeded details in the input sentence and create a customized summary, for abstract sentence summarization purposes. 
The results of the experiment indicate that the new model performs better than the leading baseline models, on English Gigaword and the DUC 2004 and MSRÂ­ATG test collections. 
The new design features an end to end neural network setup comprising a sentence encoder and selective gate network combined with a summary decoder. Representing an efficient method, for creating abstractive summaries of sentences. 
The positive points of this paper are; 
Efficient utilization of encoding enhances the summarization models performance by effectively selecting crucial details from the input sentence. 
The test results indicate that the new model performs well on various standard datasets, for summarizing sentences in a creative manner. 
The new design presents a structure by merging a selective gate network with a sequence, to sequence model in a way that adds significant value to the realm of natural language processing. 
The paper has some limitations; 
Interpretability is a challenge with the model due, to its intricate neural network structure; understanding the results and the inner workings of the selective encoding mechanism proves to be quite tricky. 
The suggested model relies on datasets for training purposes; however; such datasets may not always be accessible, for all languages and sectors. 
The models computational complexity is elevated as it incorporates a selective gate network and a sequence to sequence model; this could pose challenges for its practical implementation, in real world scenarios. 
Queries, for writers; 
How does the selective encoding mechanism. Decide which details to extract from the input sentence? 
Is it possible to use the suggested model for tasks, in natural language processing like translating text or answering questions? 
How is the suggested model able to deal with words that are not included in its vocabulary and can it be enhanced to manage unfamiliar words better?
