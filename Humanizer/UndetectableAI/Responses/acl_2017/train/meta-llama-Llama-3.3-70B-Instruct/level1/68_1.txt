A Synopsis of the Document 
The study introduces a method for evaluating the comprehension level of Vietnamese texts by analyzing various features like sentence length and word complexity across a substantial dataset of 996 documents grouped into different difficulty levels (easy to difficult). Subsequently using this dataset to devise a formula, for predicting text readability based on these features. The writers test their formulas effectiveness through cross validation and state that it achieves an accuracy of, than 80% accurately predicting the readability of Vietnamese text. 
Key Findings
The authors have developed an trustworthy collection of Vietnamese texts for use in natural language processing researchâ€”a valuable addition, to the field. 
The authors have created a formula to forecast text readability by considering factors like the average sentence length and word length as well, as the proportion of challenging words used. 
The authors assess their formulas effectiveness through cross validation and state an accuracy exceeding 80% in predicting the comprehensibility of Vietnamese text. 
Areas of expertise
The writers compile an dependable collection of Vietnamese text that greatly benefits the realm of natural language processing. 
The authors have created an efficient method, for forecasting the readability of text by utilizing a blend of easily extractable features. 
The researchers achieved an accuracy rate of more than 80% a noteworthy accomplishment, in assessing the readability of Vietnamese text. 
Areas of improvement
The writers only focus on a range of features like the average length of sentences and words as well, as the percentage of challenging words; this approach may not fully grasp all the intricacies of text comprehensibility. 
The authors fail to make a comparison, between their formula and established formulas for assessing text readability; this omission hinders the assessment of their formulas effectiveness. 
The authors only test their formula, on a collection of Vietnamese text that may not reflect all kinds of textual data.
