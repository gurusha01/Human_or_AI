This research suggests an approach named morph fitting that incorporates morphological insights into word embeddings to enhance their accuracy in languages, with complex morphology patterns like verb conjugations and noun declensions. 
The primary achievements of this study include; 
The researchers suggest an approach called the morph fitting method that leverages morphological limitations to enhance word vector spacesâ€”a valuable addition, to the realm of natural language processing. 
The technique is language independent. Can be utilized across various languages with minimal adjustments making it a significant advancement, in the realm of multilingual natural language processing (NLP).
The writers show that morph fitting enhances word similarity performance in English well as, in German and Italian and Russian languages. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The authors demonstrate that the method is strong and adaptable for use, across different word vector spaces generated by architectures. 
Enhanced results in tasks are shown by the authors through the use of morph fitting to boost the effectiveness of language comprehension models for tasks, like dialogue state tracking. 
The technique is easy to apply. Doesn't demand much computational power which makes it a viable option, for enhancing word vector spaces effectively. 
The flaws, in this paper are; 
The authors only tested the method, on dialogue state tracking. Should also consider evaluating it on other tasks for a more comprehensive assessment. 
Language specific rules are crucial in this approach. May not apply universally across all languages so it could be advantageous to investigate automated techniques, for capturing linguistic limitations further. 
Limited examination of the limitations is noted in the authors work as they do not offer an evaluation on the restrictions employed in the approach; it would be advantageous to witness a thorough examination of the constraints and their influence, on the approachs effectiveness. 
Authors are often asked questions.
How do the writers intend to expand the approach, to languages and what obstacles do they foresee in the process? 
Could the writers offer information, about the language specific guidelines implemented in the approach and explain how they were chosen? 
How do the authors intend to test the method on practical applications and which tasks do they believe would yield the most valuable insights, during evaluation?
