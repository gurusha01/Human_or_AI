This research introduces a method, for assessing the emotional tones of words through vector space models highlighting the key advancements of this study;  
A new approach has been created to determine the sentiment of words without supervision or with supervision using vector space models, like Word3Vec and GloVe. 
The proposed method is compared to an unsupervised technique called PMl lR to show its better accuracy and resilience, to data scarcity. 
Exploring how dense vector modeling can help address the issue of data, in sentiment analysis tasks. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects;  
The suggested method surpasses the current unsupervised technique PMl lR in accuracy. Shows greater resilience, to limited data availability. 
Vector space models such as WordVec and GloVe play a role in capturing the relationships between words, for sentiment analysis tasks. 
The paper thoroughly compares the method with the current one and talks about the potential drawbacks and future paths, for this research. 
The results of the experiment show how well the suggested method works in classifying sentiments and offer insights, into how dense vector modeling can help address the issue of sparse data. 
The paper has some areas that can be improved such, as;  
The results of the suggested method fall short of the performance seen in traditional supervised techniques that usually reach an accuracy rate exceeding 80%.
The technique for creating reference vectors through vector averaging may not be the approach as the improvement in results does not significantly rise with an increase, in the number of word tokens. 
The paper would be improved by providing a thorough exploration of the constraints of the suggested method and potential directions, for future research to consider. 
The evaluation of the method should extend beyond just one dataset, like the PMl R approach did; it's crucial to test it across various datasets and tasks for a more comprehensive assessment.
