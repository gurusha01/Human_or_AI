In this article a new method, for measuring text similarity called TextFlow (XF) is introduced, where text pairs are depicted as curves considering the word positions and sequence matching to determine their similarity level. The key findings of this study are; 
A unique similarity measurement called TextFlow has been introduced as a method that leverages the entire word sequence, in the texts being compared to yield a more precise and reliable assessment of text similarity. 
TextFlows unique feature lies in its asymmetric similarity measure which enables performance across various tasks like identifying paraphrases and textual relationships as well, as ranking content effectively. 
The researchers extensively tested TextFlow on eight datasets across three tasks to show how well it works consistently across various tasks and datasets. 
This paper excels, in the following areas; 
A perspective on the matter – TextFlow introduces a novel and inventive method, for gauging text similarity that overcomes the constraints of current metrics. 
The authors conduct an assessment of TextFlow across various datasets and tasks to showcase its efficiency and reliability. 
The authors of the study compare TextFlow to advanced similarity measures and demonstrate its superior performance, in various scenarios when compared to state of the art methods. 
The paper has some shortcomings; 
The authors discuss that calculating TextFlow has a time complexity of O(nm) which could pose a challenge, with large datasets. 
The authors discuss the adjustment of parameters (α​, β​ and γ​ ) to achieve the best performance possible and mention that this process may necessitate more computational resources and expertise. 
Lack of clarity is an issue, with the metric since its not straightforward to grasp why specific text pairs are deemed alike or different. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the challenges of TextFlow when dealing with extensive datasets? 
Could the writers offer explanation on how adjusting the parameters (α, β and γ ) influences TextFlows performance? 
How are the writers intending to enhance the comprehensibility of TextFlow by simplifying the explanation of the outcomes and choices taken by the metric?
