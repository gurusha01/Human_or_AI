This study suggests an approach for computing the final layer, in neural machine translation setups that lowers processing time and memory needs.The key achievements of this research include; 
The authors suggest an approach in the binary code prediction model that anticipates output words through dense bit arrays indirectly instead of directly tackling the computational complexity, from O(H x V ) to O(H log V).
The researchers present a model that merges softmax prediction, with binary code prediction to enhance the reliability of the binary code prediction system. 
The writers use convolution error codes to add extra information to the bit sequence and enhance the resilience of the binary code forecasting model. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The suggested approach decreases the time spent on computations and the amount of memory needed by the layer of the system to enhance efficiency and scalability. 
The new approach delivers translation accuracy on par, with softmax models but with smaller output layers and faster decoding speeds. 
Enhanced resistance to mistakes occurs with the integration of error correcting codes, into the code prediction model which enhances its dependability and precision. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The model becomes more intricate due, to the suggested approach that brings in added intricacy like creating and teaching the code prediction model and the error correcting codes. 
The study only assesses the suggested approach, in two translation assignments; it would be advantageous to test it on tasks and datasets to showcase its broad applicability. 
The paper fails to include a comparison of the proposed method with techniques that aim to decrease computation time and memory usage, like hierarchical softmax or differentiated softmax. 
Questions, for writers; 
How did you figure out the size for the softmax layer, in the hybrid model? 
Could you offer information regarding how the error correcting codes are developed and trained? 
How do you intend to expand this research to cover natural language processing assignments, like creating language models or categorizing texts?
