This paper suggests an approach to assessing word embeddings by emphasizing data efficiency and straightforward supervised tasks instead of the traditional methods like intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations which are deemed limited in capturing the true performance of word embeddings in practical scenarios. The new methodology entails evaluating word embeddings through supervised tasks like word similarity and analogy, across different dataset sizes. The writers also recommend incorporating a range of models. Both nonlinear and linear ones. To assess the embeddings. 
The key points addressed in this paper are; 
Evaluation that focuses Â on data efficiency is recommended by the authors when assessing word embeddings since it plays a critical role, in real world scenarios where the availability of data sets is frequently restricted. 
The authors propose utilizing supervised assignments, like word similarity and analogy to assess the quality of word embeddings directly. 
The authors suggest using a variety of models. Both linear ones. To assess the embeddings thoroughly and gain a comprehensive perspective, on their performance. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
A new approach, to evaluation methods is suggested, which aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. 
The authors performed experiments to confirm their ideas validity by utilizing different word embeddings and tasks. 
The authors delve into an examination of the suggested evaluation approach to offer a more profound insight into the fundamental principles at play. 
The shortcomings of this document include; 
The assessment method suggested might require a lot of computing power which could make it less practical, for real world use. 
The paper mainly concentrates on word embeddings without clarifying if the suggested evaluation approach can be extended to types of embeddings. 
The authors did not compare their proposed evaluation methodology directly to existing methods which makes it hard to evaluate its performance. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the computational demands of the evaluation method they are suggesting? 
Is it possible to use the suggested assessment method for kinds of embeddings, like sentence embeddings or graph embeddings? 
How do the writers intend to compare their suggested assessment approach, with techniques and which criteria will they use to assess its effectiveness?
