Overview of the Research Article
The research paper introduces a knowledge embedding approach called ITransf that facilitates knowledge transfer by identifying common patterns among relations through learning processes in a sparse attention mechanism. ITransf combines shared concept matrices using an attention mechanism to create specific projection matrices, for each relation to enhance generalization and interpretability. The effectiveness of the model is tested on two datasets. WN18 and FB15K. Where it demonstrates top notch performance without relying on external data sources.
