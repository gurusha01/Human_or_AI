This study introduces a method for automatically labeling parallel error correction data with clear edit spans and details about the types of errors made showcasing significant contributions, in this area of research; 
The authors suggest a technique for identifying changes in parallel original and revised sentences and categorizing them using a novel rule based classifier that is not dependent, on any specific dataset. 
The method allows for an assessment of system performance in terms of error types, across different datasetsâ€”a level of evaluation that current metrics cannot achieve. 
The authors plan to unveil a tool, for automated annotation, which aims to standardize current error correction datasets or enable a thorough evaluation of error types. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
A fresh perspective, on assessing error types is introduced by the authors suggesting a framework that is not tied to any specific dataset and solely depends on automatically gathered data. 
The research provides an in depth analysis of how different teams performed in identifying system errors during the CoNNL 2014 shared task, on correcting errors marking the first time such a comprehensive evaluation has been conducted. 
A handy tool will be made available by the authors for researchers to standardize current error correction datasets or assist in conducting a thorough evaluation of error types. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The classifiers assessment is constrained by a manual evaluation that may not fully showcase its effectiveness. 
The paper fails to compare the proposed approach, with established metrics for assessing error types. 
The document contains a dataset; however There is limited exploration of findings, in the analysis of results provided. 
Authors we have some questions, for you. 
How do you intend to assess how well the classifier works in an environment? 
Could you offer a comparison, between the method and the current metrics used for evaluating errors? 
How do you intend to tackle the constraints of the assessment concerning the restricted examination of outcomes?
