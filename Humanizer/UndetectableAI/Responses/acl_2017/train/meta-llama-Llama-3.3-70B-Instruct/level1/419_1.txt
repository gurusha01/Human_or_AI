This study introduces a method for cross language transfer learning in completing paradigms within morphological generation tasks The researchers suggest a strategy that utilizes labeled data from a language with abundant resources to enhance results in a language, with limited resources by employing a neural encoder decoder model. 
The papers overview; 
The study presents a technique for cross language transfer learning to fill in word forms by linking root words to their variations in different languages using a neural encoder decoder model that is currently leading in single language word form completion tasks and has been customized for cross language transfer learning applications as well.The researchers test this approach on 21 pairs of languages from language groups and show notable enhancements in precision and similarity metrics specifically in scenarios, with limited linguistic resources. 
Key findings; 
The authors introduce an approach for cross language transfer learning to enhance paradigm completion by leveraging abundant language data to boost results in languages, with limited resources. 
The authors have modified an encoder decoder model to facilitate cross language transfer learning and have shown its success, in completing paradigms effectively. 
The researchers test their method on 21 language pairs, from four language families to show how it can be used with various languages. 
Advantages; 
The authors have shown enhancements in accuracy and editing distance with a particular focus, on low resource environments. 
Utilizing language resources efficiently is demonstrated by the authors as their approach enhances performance in languages, with limited resources effectively. 
The authors show that their approach is strong when it comes to language similarity; related languages lead to improved transfer learning outcomes. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The authors might consider offering a thorough examination of the various types of errors and how they affect performance. 
The authors did not include a comparison with transfer learning methods, in their work to give a more complete view of how effective their approach is. 
The authors might want to consider delving into regularization techniques and exploring how they can affect performance. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand their approach to handle NLP tasks, like machine translation or parsing? 
Could the writers offer information, about the structure of the neural encoder decoder model and its hyperparameters? 
How do the writers intend to tackle the question of language similarity, in their approach. What does this mean for languages that have fewer available resources?
