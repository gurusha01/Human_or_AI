This paper introduces MinIE. An open information extraction system that reduces and marks extractions effectively highlighting its key advancements. 
Minimization of extractions, from Open Information Extraction systems involves streamlining the results to focus on information discarding excessive details while highlighting key insights. 
MinIE offers annotations for polarity assessments well as modality and attribution details, alongside quantities to maintain the essence of the extracted information. 
There are levels of minimization modes available, in MinIE that allow users to balance between accuracy and minimalism effectively. 
The positive aspects of this paper include; 
MinIEs effective minimization strategies result in shorter extracts while still achieving a competitive level of precision and recall. 
MinIEs enhanced annotations offer insights into the extraction process by providing details, on polarity and modality that can benefit subsequent applications. 
Flexibility is a feature of MinIE as it offers users the option to adjust the level of aggressiveness to fit their particular needs or requirements. 
The shortcomings of this document are; 
Error propagation is an issue, for MinIE as it depends on parsing dependencies and recognizing named entities which can lead to errors in the extraction process. 
MinIEs method of dealing with collocations has some limitations as it relies on a dictionary based approach which may not address all scenarios effectively and could result in disjointed collocations occurring. 
There is still room for enhancement, in the minimization methods used by MinIE; for example its negation detection may not encompass all scenarios and could benefit from improvements. 
Questions, for the writers; 
How do you intend to tackle the problem of error spreading. What methods can enhance the resilience of MinIE? 
Could you give me information about how the dictionary, for managing collocations is put together and how it could be expanded to include a wider range of situations? 
What are some of the uses for, MinIEs highlighted extractions and how can they be applied in tasks like answering questions or summarizing text?
