This research introduces a method for analyzing sentiments and detecting sarcasm by utilizing cognitive characteristics derived from eye movement patterns through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The authors present a model that autonomously extracts traits, from gaze information and integrates them with textual attributes to enhance classification accuracy. 
The primary achievements of this study include; 
The authors suggest using a CNN based method to extract features from gaze data without requiring manual feature engineering efforts. 
The approach integrates both written content and eye movement data to capture nuanced language cues that might not be easily detectable, from text alone. 
The authors show enhancements, in performance compared to current systems that depend on manually designed features or text based CNN models. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
A fresh method is incorporating traits derived from eye movements into sentiment analysis and detecting sarcasm, which is both unique and innovative. 
The authors have presented experimental findings on various datasets to showcase the efficiency of their method. 
The paper is clearly thought out. Shows a good understanding of the shortcomings, in current methods and the advantages of including cognitive aspects. 
The shortcomings of this paper include; 
Understanding the learned features and how they impact classification decisions can be difficult when using CNN models due, to their interpretability. 
Relying on gaze data can be challenging since its not always easy or practical to gather this information. 
The authors discuss the possibility of the model being susceptible, to overfitting issues when working with datasets. 
Queries for the writers; 
What strategies do the writers intend to use to tackle the problem of overfitting on data sets? 
Could the writers share perspectives on the acquired characteristics and their impact on the decisions, for classification purposes? 
How do the writers imagine gathering gaze data in settings and what obstacles and restrictions might arise?
