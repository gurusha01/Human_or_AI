In this paper is an examination of how writing assignments influence writing style by focusing specifically on the story cloze task as a testing ground for experimentation.The researchers show that engaging in writing tasks like crafting a full story or devising a coherent or nonsensical conclusion to a narrative can result in discernible variations in writing style.The key takeaways, from this study include; 
Authors have demonstrated that a basic linear classifier can effectively differentiate between kinds of story conclusions (logical ones or not) as well as the original endings, with impressive precision without taking the storys context into account. 
The researchers have accomplished an achievement, in the story cloze task by achieving a new state of the art result that surpasses earlier methods based on deep learning models. 
1.. Understanding the intricacies of NLP task design is crucial. The writers emphasize the need to factor in the writing task and how it can influence writing style when creating NLP tasks; they also propose methods to address these influences. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
A fresh perspective on examining writing style is suggested by the authors who introduce a method that centers on how writing tasks influence style instead of the usual factors, like author personality or demographics. 
A straightforward yet efficient approach was employed by the authors using a linear classifier and stylistic elements to attain impressive accuracy levels in showcasing the effectiveness of their method. 
The authorsâ€™ discoveries carry implications, for the planning of NLP assignments as they emphasize the importance of taking into account how writing tasks can influence writing style. 
The limitations of this document are; 
The authors have a focus on just one task. The story cloze task. Which could restrict how broadly applicable their findings are, to other NLP tasks. 
The authors fail to delve into the cognitive implications of their findings that could offer more insights, into how writing tasks relate to writing style. 
The writers recognize that there may be biases in the data they used due, to the nature of the story cloze task they employed in their study and how this could impact the broader applicability of their results. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand their method to cover NLP tasks and what obstacles do they foresee facing in the process? 
Could the writers offer details on the cognitive impacts of their discoveries and how they connect to previous studies, on writing style and mental well being? 
How do the writers intend to tackle any biases, in the data and what measures can they implement to ensure that their discoveries can be applied to other datasets and tasks effectively?
