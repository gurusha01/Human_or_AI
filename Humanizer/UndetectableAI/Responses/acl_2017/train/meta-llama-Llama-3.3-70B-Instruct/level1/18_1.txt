This paper introduces a neural network design known as Attention over Attention Reader (Ao A Reader) specially designed for cloze style reading comprehension tasks showcasing significant advancements in this field.  
The inclusion of an attention, over agreement feature enables the system to autonomously create " attention" across different document level attentions. 
Proposing an N best re ranking approach, to reassess candidates. Enhance overall effectiveness further. 
Reaching top tier performance levels on known datasets such as CNN and the Childrens Book Test is considered a significant accomplishment, in the field. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The AoD Reader surpasses cutting edge systems by a significant margin showcasing the efficiency of the suggested attention, over focus technique. 
The strategy of re ranking the options is quite effective, in enhancing outcomes. Especially when used alongside the AoN Reader tool. 
The document thoroughly examines the findings. Includes a detailed assessment of how well the AoU Reader performed across various document lengths and answer frequencies. 
The suggested model is straightforward and versatile enough to be used for tasks and datasets. 
The papers drawbacks include; 
The paper heavily depends on the belief that using the attention over everything mechanism effectively captures the connections, between the document and the query. 
In some situations the N best re ranking approach might not work well. Selecting the right features and weights could need some fine tuning. 
The paper lacks a comparison, with other advanced systems which makes grasping the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model challenging. 
The paper would be improved by delving into the attention, over aâ€Œttention mechanism and exploring how it impacts the models effectiveness. 
Queries, for writers; 
How does the attention, over focus mechanism manage situations where the document and query exhibit varying lengths or structures? 
Can the N best re ranking approach be used for tasks or datasets as well and if yes what changes would be necessary to implement it effectively? 
How is the suggested model dealing with situations where the response's longer, than one word or cannot be found in the text? 
Is it possible to apply the attention over attention mechanism to types of neural network models, like recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks?
