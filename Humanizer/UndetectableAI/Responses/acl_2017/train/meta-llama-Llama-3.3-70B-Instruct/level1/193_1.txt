In this paper is a parser called TUP A that focuses Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation ( UCCA ) a framework, for semantic representation that works across different languages. The key achievements of this study are ;
Introducing a transition based parser called TUPAS. The initial parser tailored for UCCA that can manage the distinctive characteristics of UCCA like reentrancy and non terminal nodes, within discontinuous structures. 
The authors suggest creating a transition set and introducing new features to better address the intricacies of UCCA by incorporating bidirectional LSTMs, for feature representation. 
The authors assess TUPADs performance on the English UCCA datasets, in both unfamiliar contexts and showcase its proficiency in analyzing UCCA structures. 
The positive aspects of this document include; 
The innovative aspect of this method lies in the fact that TUPa stands out as the parser crafted exclusively for UCCA with a transition set and characteristics customized to address the distinctive attributes of UCCA. 
The results of the experiment demonstrate that TUPA performs better than baseline models such as bilexical graph parsers and tree parsers in various scenarios. Both, within its designated domain and outside of it. 
The possible effects on parsing could be significant if a parser for UCCA is created because it could allow for the application of this framework in different ways, like evaluating machine translation and simplifying sentences or summarizing information. 
The papers flaws include; 
The authors could benefit from providing a thorough comparison of TUPA with other semantic parsers, like those utilized for Abstract Meaning Representation (AM R) rather than just focusing on bilexcial graph parsers and tree parsers. 
Further assessment is required as the authors only tested TUP on English UCCA datasets; additional evaluation, across languages and datasets is needed to showcase its reliability and relevance. 
The complexity of the parser may be higher due, to the incorporation of LSTMs and a unique transition kit potentially making TUPA more challenging to train compared to other parsers. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand TUPA to accommodate languages and datasets? 
Could the authors offer information regarding how they trained TUPA and tuned the hyperparameters for it? 
How do the writers imagine TUPA being applied in scenarios like assessing machine translation and simplifying sentences in real life?
