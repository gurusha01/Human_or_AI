This research paper makes an addition to the realm of natural language processing ( NLP ) as it delves into the analysis of dependency parsing in Singlish—a derivative language rooted in English. The writers develop a treebank for dependencies and create a neural network model that utilizes syntactic insights, from English to enhance parsing precision. 
The primary accomplishments of this study are; 
A Singlish dependency treebank was developed by the authors containing 1200 sentences—an asset for upcoming studies, in Singlish NLP research. 
The researchers have created a neural network model for parsing sentences in Singlish that combines English grammatical rules, with advanced parsing technology to vastly enhance the accuracy of sentence analysis. 
The authors illustrate how neural stacking can successfully transfer insights, from an English treebank to enhance the parsing accuracy of Singlish. 
This paper excels, in the following areas; 
The research introduces a perspective by focusing on Singlish and plays a role in enhancing NLP tools for languages, with limited resources. 
The authors offer an overview of how they built the treebank to guarantee its quality and dependability. 
The new model performs well by surpassing the basic models and showcasing the efficacy of this approach, with remarkable outcomes. 
The deficiencies of this paper are as follows; 
The treebanks size is somewhat limited when compared to languages which could impact the models overall performance and adaptability despite its value, as a resource. 
Relying significantly on materials can greatly impact the models effectiveness in languages with limited resources available, for use. 
The authors missed an opportunity to showcase the effectiveness of their approach by not comparing it to transfer learning methods. 
Authors are often asked questions.
How do the writers intend to enhance the treebank in order to boost the effectiveness and applicability of the model? 
Could the writers offer information, about the neural stacking structure and its hyperparameters? 
How do the writers plan to implement this technique in languages, with limited resources and what obstacles do they expect to face?
