This study suggests a method, for organizing text by utilizing discourse structure based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to enhance the precision of categorization algorithms.The researchers present a neural network that utilizes a discourse dependency tree to generate a text representation that highlights important content from both the RST and task viewpoints. 
The key achievements of this study include; 
The writers show that organizing the text effectively can enhance the accuracy of text categorization even if the organization of discourse isnâ€™t flawless. 
A unique attention mechanism has been suggested in the study. Drawing inspiration from RST. Which enables the model to grasp the significance of text segments without standardizing attention weights. 
The authors were able to achieve the results in four, out of five datasets using their approach which shows its effectiveness. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The authors clearly explain why they chose to incorporate discourse structure in text categorization and point out the shortcomings of methods. 
The authors carried out experiments, on five datasets to compare their method with the latest techniques available. 
The authors thoroughly examine the results by conducting an analysis that includes assessing the attention weights qualitatively and discussing how parsing performance impacts categorization accuracy. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
"Having many parameters, in the complete model can cause overfitting issues when dealing with smaller datasets."
The method may not apply effectively to genres with distinct discourse structures like legislative bills due, to its limited generalizability. 
Relying on the discourse parser plays a role, in determining the accuracy of categorization results and could potentially restrict the practicality of this method. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the problem of overparameterization, in the model? 
Could the authors offer explanations on why the method is ineffective, for legislative bills? 
How do the writers intend to enhance the conversation analyzer to boost the precision of the classification system?
