This study introduces a method for forecasting volatility by examining the sentiments expressed in the annual 10 K reports of companies listed in the stock market. The researchers assess how advanced Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models that utilize word embedding data can predict volatility. Additionally they look into techniques, for integrating textual data with factual market information. 
The primary achievements of this study include; 
The authors suggest using a word embedding technique, for sentiment analysis that surpasses leading methods by a large margin. 
They analyze the features of reports from companies across financial industries and demonstrate that specialized training, for each sector does not enhance performance mainly because of the restricted amount of training data available. 
The authors show how effective it is to blend written and factual market data by utilizing fusion techniques such, as stacking and Multi Kernel Learning (MK).
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The authors offer an examination of previous studies and effectively explain the reasoning, behind their approach. 
They run experiments to assess how well their method works and present, in depth outcomes. 
The document is nicely. Simple to understand. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The authors fail to offer an explanation for the reasoning, behind their method that relies on word embeddings. 
The paper would be improved by delving into the analysis of the results and exploring the implications of the findings in more depth. 
Some of the charts and graphs may need enhancement to enhance their clarity and readability. 
Authors here are some inquiries, for you; 
Could you explain the reasoning, behind your method of using word embeddings and how it enhances current techniques? 
How do you intend to tackle the challenge of having training data, within various industries and what solutions are you considering for this issue? 
Could you delve deeper into the analysis of the results. Talk about what these findings could mean for how your method could be used in finance and industry applications?
