This article introduces Grid Beam Search (GBS) a method that expands beam search to incorporate predetermined restrictions.The key aspects of this research are; 
Introducing Grid Beam Search, a decoding technique suggested by the authors that allows for the integration of lexical limitations, into the resulting sequence of any sequence generating model. 
GBS offers versatility. Can be applied to various sequence generation models, like machine translation, automatic summarization, image captioning and dialog generation. 
The algorithm aims to operate by having a runtime complexity of O(k t c) and can be parallelized to fill all beams at each timestep simultaneously. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
In the realm of natural language processing (NLP) the integration of GBS marks an advancement due to its ability to seamlessly integrate lexical limitations into sequence generation models, in a versatile and effective manner. 
The authors showcase how well GBS works in experiments such as interactive post editings and domain adaptation, for machine translation. 
The algorithm has a range of uses and can be utilized in various text creation endeavors which enhances its significance in the field. 
The paper has some shortcomings; 
The intricacy of the algorithm and how its put, into practice might be challenging for some individuals to grasp fully. 
The authors have only tested GBS on machine translation tasks; its performance, on sequence generation tasks remains uncertain. 
The authors did not thoroughly compare GBS to methods used in incorporating lexical constraints into sequence generation models. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to assess GBS in tasks, like summarizing text automatically and describing images in captions? 
Could the authors possibly elaborate further on how they applied GBS in their research study by sharing information, about the specific models and hyperparameters utilized during the experiments? 
How do the writers intend to tackle the intricacies of GBS and make it easier for a broader group of researchers and professionals to understand?
