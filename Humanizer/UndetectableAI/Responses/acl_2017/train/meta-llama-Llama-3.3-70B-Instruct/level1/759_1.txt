This study introduces a method that combines models to recognize topics discussed in verbal meetings and classify the connections, between speakers contributions.  
A new combined model that utilizes the connection between content and conversation to enhance forecasting accuracy, for tasks involving selecting content phrases and predicting discourse relations effectively. 
Using an approach of the model to address discourse relationships as hidden variables in cases where actual labels are unavailable, for training purposes. 
The use of the model to anticipate how well team members grasp their group decisions is an element of meeting analysis. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The suggested combined model performs better than SVM based classifiers, in both selecting phrases and predicting discourse relations tasks â€“ proving the efficiency of the modeling strategy. 
Using connections, in conversations enables the model to be used in situations where actual labels are missing supporting its practicality and broad applicability. 
The models assessment of its ability to predict comprehension consistency during meetings suggests that its application could enhance the effectiveness of cutting edge models, for this purpose. 
The paper has some shortcomings, which include; 
The system depends on a group of predetermined characteristics that might not encompass all the subtleties of human interaction and could need precise adjustments to achieve the best results, for its functioning. 
Using a scoring system, in the joint learning process might not be the best approach; utilizing more advanced scoring mechanisms could enhance the models performance even further. 
The models effectiveness is assessed on a number of datasets and its performance may differ when tested on additional datasets or, in diverse situations. 
Queries, for writers; 
What are the strategies the authors intend to employ in tackling the challenge of feature engineering and which techniques can be utilized to extract pertinent features from the dataset? 
Could the writers offer information regarding the scoring mechanism utilized in the collaborative learning algorithm and its selection process? 
How do the writers intend to expand the models capabilities to address intricate situations like meetings involving multiple parties or discussions, on various topics?
