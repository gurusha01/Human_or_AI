This document outlines a method for creating a test dataset to validate models of distributional semantics in Polish language which has limited resources available, for such tasks.The key findings of this research are;  
We developed a Polish assessment dataset containing 10k sentence pairs labeled for similarity and inference to assess the effectiveness of compositional distributional semantics models, in Polish language processing tasks. 
Creating a method for constructing the dataset involves applying the SICK corpus design principles in Polish while considering the scarcity of external resources and the requirement, for language specific transformation guidelines. 
Introducing a human verification step to ensure the accuracy of revised sentences and making additional corrections afterwards enhances the overall quality of the dataset. 
The submission excels, in the following aspects;  
The dataset produced is of quality and shows good agreement between annotators, for both entailment labels (κ = 0•732 ) and relatedness scores (α = 0•78). 
The process that was created is thoroughly. Can be modified for use, in other languages that have limited resources available. 
The assessment data set will be released to the public to promote the advancement of distributional semantics models in Polish and other languages, with limited resources. 
The document offers an explanation of how sentences are annotated and includes the guidelines and sample sentences used in the annotation process. 
Utilizing Fleiss’ kappa and Krippendorff’s alpha for assessing rater agreement offers a dependable way to evaluate the datasets quality. 
The submission has areas that could be improved such, as... 
The method created relies on the SICK corpus and may not be directly relevant, for languages or fields. 
The dataset only contains 10 thousand sentence pairs which might not be enough, for training and testing models that handle the distribution of meanings in an adequate manner. 
The paper lacks an assessment of the models, for compositional distributional semantics that can be developed and assessed using the dataset created. 
The linguistic rules developed for Polish may not be applicable, to languages. 
The paper would be improved by delving into the consequences of the findings and exploring how the dataset could be used in practical situations. 
Queries, for writers;  
How do the writers intend to tackle the issue of the datasets size and guarantee that it is adequate, for training and assessing models that deal with compositional distributional semantics? 
Can the process be adjusted for use, in languages or areas of expertise and what changes would need to be made? 
How do the writers intend to assess the models, for distributional semantics that can be developed and tested with the dataset they have created? 
What do the findings suggest for creating models that analyze how words are put together in Polish and other languages with resources? 
How do the authors intend to share the dataset with the public and make sure it is easily accessible to researchers, in the field?
