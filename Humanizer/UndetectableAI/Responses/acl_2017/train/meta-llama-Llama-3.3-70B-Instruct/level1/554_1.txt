This study introduces a Bayesian learning approach, for recurrent neural networks (RNNS) employing stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG MCMC). The key advancements of this research include; 
A new approach put forward by the authors involves using SG MCMC to train RNN weight uncertainty and prevent overfitting issues in a scalable manner. 
The suggested method offers an approach to enhance RNN performance through the incorporation of gradient noise during training and employing model averaging during testing, for effective regularization purposes. 
The authors showcase how well their method performs on tasks in natural language processing such as language modeling and image captioning as well, as sentence classification. 
The positive aspects highlighted in this document are; 
The authors offer an succinct elucidation of the theoretical underpinnings of SG MCMC and how it is utilized in RNN applications. 
The authors performed experiments on various standard datasets to showcase the efficiency of their method. 
The authors in this study evaluate their method by comparing its effectiveness with cutting edge techniques, like stochastic optimization and dropout methods. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The suggested method involves running passes multiple times for model averaging, during testing stages which could potentially lead to higher computational load. 
The authors showcase how well their method works in modeling weight uncertainty but do not delve into an examination of the uncertainty estimates. 
The authors did not provide a comparison of their approach to Bayesian methods, like variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to deal with the burden of their method during testing? 
Could the authors offer an elaborate examination of the uncertainty assessments derived from their method? 
How does the suggested method stack up against Bayesian techniques, like variational inference or Monte Carlo dropout?
