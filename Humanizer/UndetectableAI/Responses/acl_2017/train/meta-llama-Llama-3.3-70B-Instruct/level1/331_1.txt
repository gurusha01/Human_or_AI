This study suggests an approach to multi document summarization using concept maps and introduces a fresh dataset of concept maps summarizing diverse sets of online educational materials.The researchers propose the use of low context importance labeling through crowdsourcing to identify components within extensive collections of documents effectively.The process of creating the dataset involves preprocessing alongside scalable crowdsourcing and expert annotations, for high quality results. 
The key accomplishments highlighted in this study are; 
A new idea, for summarization task is suggested. Concept map based MDS that goes beyond the summarization tasks by depicting summaries as concept maps. 
A new benchmark dataset will be developed consisting of concept maps summarizing web documents on a large scale to serve as a crucial reference point, for assessing the suggested task. 
Introducing a crowdsourcing method called Low context importance annotation for efficiently and accurately assigning importance scores to propositions. 
The papers key advantages include; 
The authors suggest a new task that goes beyond conventional summarization tasks to create more informative and valuable summaries. 
Creating a collection of diverse web documents poses a significant challenge and serves as a practical benchmark, for assessing concept map based MDS systems. 
An efficient method for crowdsourcing involves using an annotation system that has been proven effective in gathering accurate importance ratings for ideas that are crucial, for developing top notch concept maps. 
The paper has some shortcomings, such, as; 
There is a basic evaluation of the proposed task and corpus using a simple baseline method, in the limited assessment which may not fully showcase the capabilities of concept map based MDS. 
The paper fails to compare concept map based MDS with summarization tasks directly; hence it is challenging to evaluate the advantages of the former. 
The task at hand is quite complex as it includes subtasks, like extracting propositions and annotating importance as well as constructing concept maps. All of which present challenges when it comes to optimization and evaluation. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the intricacy of the task at hand and enhance the effectiveness of concept map driven MDS systems? 
Can the writers offer details, on the features of the developed dataset and how it sets itself apart from other summarization datasets? 
What real world situations do the authors imagine using concept map based MDS for and what advantages and difficulties may arise from this method?
