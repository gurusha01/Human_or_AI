This research introduces a method for translating between languages, with varying levels of representation imbalance; in this case focusing specificallyon Chinese to Spanish translation. Separating the translation process from morphology generation.The key highlights of this study are as follows; 
The researchers suggest making the grammar of Spanish simpler by eliminating gender and number variations to strike a balance, between improving translation accuracy and reducing the complexity of generating morphology. 
The researchers have created a neural network structure for generating morphology that involves various layers like embedding and recurrent neural networks among others and has shown superior performance in classification tasks compared to traditional machine learning methods, like SVM and random forests. 
The researchers show that their method enhances translation outcomes by achieving an increase of, up to 0..seven METEO points compared to the system. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
A fresh method, for creating word forms in a way was suggested by the authors using advanced deep learning methods that delivered cutting edge outcomes. 
The authors show in their work that their method enhances translation outcomes significantly. An addition, to the realm of machine translation. 
The paper is. Structured nicely which makes it easy to read and comprehend. 
The paper has its shortcomings, which include; 
The authors assessment is constrained by focusing on one language pair (Chinese, to Spanish) restricting the broader applicability of their findings. 
The authors did not provide a comparison of their method, with cutting edge systems which makes evaluating the importance of their findings challenging. 
The authors failure to offer an, in depth examination of the findings hinders comprehension of the merits and drawbacks of their methodology. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand their method to include sets of languages? 
How are the writers intending to differentiate their method from cutting edge systems? 
Could the authors offer a thorough examination of the outcomes by delving into the errors made by their system in detail?
