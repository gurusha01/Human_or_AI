This document suggests a method that combines trained context embeddings, from bidirectional language models with semi supervised techniques to handle sequence tagging tasks like named entity recognition (NER). The key points of this study include; 
The authors show how utilizing existing language models can enhance the efficiency of sequence tagging models. Even if the language model was trained in a separate domain. 
The researchers demonstrate that employing both forward and backward language models can enhance results compared to using a forward language model. 
The new approach delivers top notch outcomes on two used datasets, for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and chunking tasks surpassing existing benchmarks. 
The highlights of this document are; 
A straightforward and universal method is suggested, making it easy to use and suitable, for tasks involving tagging sequences. 
The authors show advancements compared to the top results seen in previous studies on two well known datasets. 
The suggested approach remains effective even if the language model is trained in a domain which proves its practicality, for real world usage scenarios. 
The paper has some shortcomings, including the following; 
The authors could have delved deeper into their analysis by offering a thorough examination of the results through conducting ablation studies to discern the impact of each element in the suggested approach. 
Relying on trained language models can pose challenges as they may not always be accessible or may demand substantial computing power for training purposes. 
The authors missed the opportunity to compare their approach with other semi supervised learning methods like co training or expectation maximization, for a more thorough assessment. 
Questions, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to expand this study to cover types of sequence tagging tasks, like labeling parts of speech or parsing dependencies? 
Could the writers offer a thorough examination of the findings by including in depth studies, on the impact and visual illustrations of the acquired knowledge? 
How do the writers intend to tackle the reliance on trained language models. For instance, by enhancing training methods or exploring different sources of pre trained models?
