This research introduces an approach called Neural Belief Tracking ( NBT ) for spoken conversation systems that addresses the shortcomings of existing methods by utilizing pre trained word embeddings to manage variations, in language and structure effectively. 
The authors introduce a framework that connects Spoken Language Understanding (SLIu.). Dialogue State Tracking (OST) eliminating the need, for manually created semantic lexicons. 
The NBT models make use of existing word vectors to understand connections, between words and adapt to different ways users express themselves. 
The authors assess the NBT models, on two datasets. DSTCT and WOS 20.. Show how they perform as well as cutting edge models that depend on manually created semantic lexicons. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
A fresh approach is introduced by the NBT framework that presents an outlook, on monitoring beliefs and could enhance the effectiveness of conversational systems. 
The authors emphasize the significance of utilizing notch pre trained word vectors to enhance the effectiveness of the NBT models. 
The research paper conducts an assessment of the NBT models, on two datasets to offer a complete insight into their advantages and limitations. 
The limitations of this document are; 
The authors did not extensively examine the mistakes made by the NBT models to pinpoint areas that could be enhanced for performance. 
Reliance on existing word embeddings is crucial for the effectiveness of NBT models as the quality of these embeddings can vary in terms of availability and suitability, across different languages and fields. 
The paper fails to include a comparison of the NBT models with neural models, for belief tracking which could offer a more thorough insight into their advantages and limitations. 
Questions, for writers; 
How are the NBT models designed to deal with words that're not in the vocabulary or, with user language that has not been seen before? 
Could the writers give information, about how they adjusted the hyperparameters for the NBT models? 
How well do NBT models work in dialogue systems across domains or in languages other, than English?
