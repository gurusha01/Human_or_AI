This research introduces a method for labeling training data in event extraction tasks by leveraging both world knowledge and linguistic knowledge automatically.The authors highlight three contributions in their work;(1)demonstrating the ability to automate data labeling for large scale event extraction tasks using world and linguistic knowledge,(2)suggesting a method to identify key arguments and triggers for different event types and (3)evidence of the efficiency of their approach, through manual and automated assessments. 
The primary impacts of this study are ranked by significance as follows; 
The authors suggest a technique for creating labeled data for environmental engineering (EE) which is a valuable addition, to the field. 
The writers suggest a method to identify points and stimuli for every type of event that is crucial, for precise Event Extraction (EE).
The authors thoroughly assess their method. Suggest a foundational model (DMCNN MIL) which could be explored further in studying this dataset. 
The positive aspects of this entry are; 
A new method is suggested by the authors to tag training data, for entity extraction (EE) aiming to overcome the constraints of supervised learning techniques that depend on costly human labeled data. 
The authors thoroughly assess their method through evaluations involving both manual and automatic processes to showcase its effectiveness on a large scale. 
The authors present a starting model (DMCNN MIL) paving the way for exploration in this datasetâ€”a valuable addition, to the field. 
The authors make their labeled data available for others to use in enhancing EE models. 
The flaws, in this entry include; 
The method used by the authors is quite intricate as it includes elements such as identifying main arguments and trigger words while also incorporating soft distant supervision techniques which could pose difficulties, in execution and replication. 
The method used by the authors depends on knowledge (Freebase database) as well as language structures (FrameNet) which may not always be accessible and precise, for every kind of event and language. 
The authors recognize that the assigned labels in their data might have some errors that could impact how well models, for EE perform when trained on such data. 
The authors only test their method on a range of 21 event types that may not fully represent all possible event categories. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the authors intend to simplify their method and ensure it is easily understood by researchers? 
How do the writers intend to expand their method to include kinds of events and languages? 
How do the writers aim to enhance the precision of their assigned labels and decrease interference, in the data? 
Could the authors offer information, about the DMCNN MIL model and how it is put into practice?
