Summary of the paper; 
The paper introduces a method called PositionRank for extracting key phrases from academic papers in an unsupervised manner using a graph based approach. PositionRank considers the word position and frequency in the document to rank them similar to PageRank but with bias. By creating a word graph with words as nodes and cooccurrences as edges from the documents content and assigning weights based on their positions helps in ranking the words, within the PageRank algorithm. The research paper assesses PositionRank using three sets of papers and demonstrates its superior performance over TextRank and other established methods, like SingleRank and ExpandRank. 
Key Contributions; 
The article introduces an unsupervised graph based algorithm that integrates position details into a biased PageRank, for extracting keyphrases. 
Enhanced Results; The research paper demonstrates that PositionRank performs better than established benchmarks, like TextRank, SingleRank and ExpandRank across three sets of papers. 
The research paper shows that the enhancements in MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) precision rate accuracy and F measure, for PositionRank exhibit significance. 
Advantages; 
The research introduces an algorithm that integrates positional data into a biased PageRank methodâ€”a valuable addition, to the realm of extracting key phrases. 
The study indicates that PositionRank surpasses benchmarks, in performance levels highlighting the algorithms efficacy. 
The study thoroughly assesses the effectiveness of PositionRank using three sets of papers to gain a full insight into how well the algorithm performs. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper has a focus on comparing PositionRank with just a few solid baseline models; however it would be more advantageous to include comparisons, with other cutting edge algorithms as well. 
The paper lacks an examination of the findings that could offer insights, into the algorithms pros and cons. 
The paper lacks an error analysis section that could have helped in pinpointing the algorithms mistakes and areas needing enhancement. 
Questions, for Writers; 
How does PositionRank manage documents that cover topics or subtopics? 
Can PositionRank be utilized for kinds of documents, like websites or emails? 
How do the selection of window size and damping factor influence the effectiveness of PositionRank?
