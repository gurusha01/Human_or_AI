This research introduces a concept called rare entity prediction that focuses on predicting absent entities, in online articles using external knowledge from lexical resources.The authors present a dataset called Wikilinks Rare Entity Prediction and suggest two models. Double Encoder (DOUBENC) and Hierarchical Double Encoder (HIERENC) aimed at addressing this challenge. Key highlights of this study include; 
The authors introduce a task that involves predicting absent entities, in online articles—a complex challenge owing to the varying language styles and numerous rare entities involved in the process. 
The authors have upgraded the Wikilinks dataset to offer an advanced version for assessing models, in the rare entity prediction task on a larger scale. 
The authors put forth the Encoder and Hierarchical Double Encoder models as a solution, to predicting rare entities by utilizing external knowledge from lexical resources and achieving notable enhancements in performance compared to standard models. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The writers suggest a task that deals with a major hurdle, in processing natural language – predicting uncommon entities mentioned in online articles. 
The authors have developed a dataset that serves as a standard, for assessing models in predicting rare entities. 
The authors suggest two models that show advancements compared to standard models by utilizing external knowledge to tackle the challenge of predicting rare entities effectively. 
The paper has some flaws ; 
The authors evaluation of their models is restricted to accuracy this may not provide a complete assessment of the models performance capabilities. 
The authors failed to compare their models to the cutting edge models, in similar tasks; this lack of comparison makes evaluating the performance of their models challenging. 
The authors lack of analysis of the results hinders comprehension of their models strengths and weaknesses. 
Questions, for writers; 
How are the authors intending to expand their research to include forms of external knowledge like relational data between entities, in the future? 
How are the authors intending to assess their models using evaluation measures, like precision, recall and F score? 
How do the authors intend to evaluate their models against the models in tasks, like identifying entities and resolving ambiguities?
