This study presents a method for analyzing arguments in text called argumentation mining. An important aspect of natural language processing that focuses on recognizing the organization of arguments within written content.The researchers propose a neural model utilizing a Pointer Network structure to identify connections, between different parts of arguments and categorize them simultaneously.This model demonstrates performance compared to earlier approaches that depend on manually created characteristics and integer linear programming algorithms when evaluated on two datasets. 
The primary achievements of this study are; 
The authors suggest a method that combines link extraction and argument component classification to enhance argumentation mining by capturing the connections, between argument components and their categories for better results. 
The writers modified the Pointer Network design, for argumentation mining to help the model better understand the order of argument elements and their connections effectively. 
The authors test their model on two datasets. The Persusasive Essay corpus well as the Microtext corpus. Achieving impressive results that outperform previous benchmarks, in both cases. 
The paper excels, in the following areas.
A fresh perspective on argumentation mining is suggested by the writers as they introduce a method that combines link extraction and classification of argument componentsâ€”a notable departure from prior research, in this field. 
The authors have successfully incorporated the Pointer Network architecture for argumentation mining tasks to enable the model to capture the relationships, between argument elements and their connections effectively. 
The authors have successfully attained top notch outcomes on two assessment datasets to showcase the efficiency of their method. 
The papers shortcomings include; 
The authors examination of the results is lacking as it only compares with studies and fails to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the merits and shortcomings of their method. 

The authors assessment is restricted as they only test their model on two datasets that may not fully encompass all varieties of text. 
Authors are often asked questions.
Could you give me a thorough breakdown of the insights gained from the data and the choices made by the system? 
How do you intend to expand this research to encompass forms of persuasive writing, like debates or conversations? 
Can you compare the Pointer Network architecture to neural structures like graph convolutional networks or recurrent neural networks to show how effective it is, for argumentation mining?
