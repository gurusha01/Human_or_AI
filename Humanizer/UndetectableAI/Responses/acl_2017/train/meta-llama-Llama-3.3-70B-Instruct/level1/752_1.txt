In this paper a new method for parsing and generating Abstract Meaning Representation (AMRs) utilizing sequence to sequence (seq, to seq ) models is introduced. The key findings of this study include; 
Utilizing data efficiently was shown by the writers through training seq to seq models with millions of unlabeled sentences to address data sparsity issues effectively and achieve strong performance in AMW parsing as well as leading results, in AMW realization tasks. 
The authors present a training approach where the parser and realizer can acquire top notch representations of input and output language through a paired training process using millions of loosely labeled examples. 
The authors demonstrate that their sequence, to sequence models can handle discrepancies caused by transforming AMRs into sequences so that they are not overly reliant upon the exact order of linearization. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The authors have made an advancement compared to their previous work by achieving top notch outcomes in AMRs realization and competitive results, in AMRs parsing as well. Exemplifying the efficacy of their methodology. 
The authors thoroughly assess their method through a series of experiments such, as ablation studies and error analysis to showcase the significance of each component in their approach. 
The paper is nicely. The authors have presented their approach and findings in a clear and easy to understand manner. 
The paper has its limitations, including; 
The writers use sources, like the Gigaword corpus to train their models; this might restrict how broadly their method can be used in different fields or languages. 
The authors could delve deeper into analyzing the kinds of errors made by their models to pinpoint areas that need improvement instead of just providing a basic error analysis. 
The authors did not include any comparisons to seq to seq models, in their approach analysis. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the reliance on sources, like the Gigaword corpus in order to broaden the use of their method? 
Can the authors offer a thorough examination of the mistakes made by their models and provide examples of typical errors along with suggestions, for enhancement strategies? 
How do the authors believe their method could be expanded to tackle tasks in natural language processing, like machine translation or question answering and what obstacles could they encounter in the process?
