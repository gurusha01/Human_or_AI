This research introduces a method for interactive topic modeling known as "Joint Anchors," which expands on the anchor words concept, by enabling the combination of multiple words into anchor facets simultaneously. The writers argue that this method yields topic models with improved usability and scalability compared to current interactive topic modeling methods. 
The key advancements presented in this study are; 
The incorporation of tandem anchors enables the merging of words into anchor facets, in order to enhance the intuitiveness and effectiveness of the anchor words algorithm. 
Several methods have been devised to merge anchor facets taking the vector average; using the or operator; finding the element wise minimum; and calculating the harmonic mean. 
The user study assessed the effectiveness of the tandem anchors method. Found that it generates superior quality topic models and is easier to use compared to using single word anchors alone. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The new method is innovative. Overcomes the drawbacks of current interactive topic modeling methods. 
The authors thoroughly assess the method by conducting a user study and comparing it with approaches. 
The article is nicely. Straightforward to understand with clear descriptions of the suggested method and its benefits. 
The paper has some shortcomings ; 
The writers expect that the reader has an understanding of the topic modeling algorithm and its settings – something that non experts might not necessarily possess. 
The study involving users is restricted to a group of individuals and might not accurately reflect the broader population. 
The writers did not thoroughly examine the intricacies of the suggested method—a critical aspect, for dealing with extensive datasets. 
Queries, for writers; 
How do the writers intend to tackle the challenge of users familiarity, with topic modeling algorithms and parameters? 
Could the writers elaborate further on how complex the proposed method's computationally and whether it can handle big datasets effectively? 
How do the writers intend to expand their suggested method to incorporate types of information, like pictures or videos?
