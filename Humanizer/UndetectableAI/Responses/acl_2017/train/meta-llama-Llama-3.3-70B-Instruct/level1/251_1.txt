This research paper introduces a framework for analyzing how word embeddings combine in models like Skip Gram model by showing that the composition operator is nonlinear based on the word vectors but simplifies to vector addition, with uniform word frequency assumption. The article also makes a link, between the Skip Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) indicating that by adjusting the parameters of Skip Gram models one can derive the parameters of SDR models. 
The key achievements of this study are; 
A mathematical framework that explores how words are combined in embedding models to grasp the concept of adding meanings in word vectors. 
The Skip Gram models composition operator is shown to be non linear in cases but simplifies, to vector addition when assuming uniform word frequencies. 
There is a link between the Skip Gram model and the SDR framework that offers a backing, for employing Skip Gram models in tasks relatedto natural language processing. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The article presents a mathematical structure for exploring how word embeddings models handle compositionality, in language processing. 
The link between the Skip Gram model and the SDR framework offers a rationale, for utilizing Skip Gram models in various applications. 
The article presents a concise and eloquent explanation of the ideas and evidence in a way that can be understood by many readers. 
The drawbacks of this document are; 
The paper suggests that a consistent distribution of word frequencies is assumed; however this may not accurately reflect the reality, in natural language processing scenarios. 
The paper lacks real world testing of the suggested framework to prove its effectiveness. 
The article fails to mention the drawbacks of the suggested framework in terms of its capacity to manage words or words, with various interpretations. 
Inquiries, for writers; 
How are the writers intending to tackle the idea of assuming that word frequencies are evenly distributed in natural language processing tasks when that might not be realistic, in practice? 
Can the writers offer assessments of the suggested framework by comparing it to other word embedding models or testing it on particular natural language processing assignments? 
How do the writers intend to expand the suggested framework to address intricate language challenges like unfamiliar words or words, with various meanings?
