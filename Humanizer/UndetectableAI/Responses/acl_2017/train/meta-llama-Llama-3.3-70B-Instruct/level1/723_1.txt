This article introduces a method, for breaking down words into morphemes called MORSE that combines orthographic and semantic elements in the segmentation process.The authors argue that their strategy is the first to incorporate wide syntactic and semantic details for this purpose.The key advancements of this research include; 
MORSE integrates information into the process of segmenting morphemes to reduce errors caused by, over segmentation. 
The system assesses relationships across a broad range of vocabulary by examining the coherence of variance vectors, between word pairs. 
The authors have introduced a dataset called SD17 to tackle the shortcomings found in current benchmarking datasets, like the Morph Challenge dataset. 
The highlights of this document are; 
MORSE has achieved top notch performance by surpassing published results, on the Morph Challenge dataset. 
The frameworks reliance on information aids in minimizing errors caused by, over segmentation when dealing with words that shouldn't be separated based on their meaning. 
The writers present an examination of the hyperparameters and how they influence MORSEs effectiveness which enables users to manage the balance, between accuracy and completeness. 
The limitations of this paper include; 
The vocabulary size of MORSE is restricted to one million words which could potentially be inadequate for languages, like Finnish that have morphology capabilities. 
The frameworks inference stage utilizes an approach that could result in less, than optimal performance if an incorrect segmentation occurs early on in the process. 
MORSE is tailored for languages with morphology and may not be as effective for those, with non concatentative morphology patterns. 
Queries for the writers; 
How do the writers intend to overcome the challenge of limitations, in MORSE and what impact might expanding the vocabulary have in terms of the frameworks performance? 
Could the writers offer information about how they optimized the training process computationally in MORSE and its potential effects on the broader acceptance of the platform, within the community? 
How do the writers intend to expand MORSE to deal with concatenate morphology and what obstacles and possibilities lie ahead in this endeavor?
