This article introduces a method for filling detailed categories with examples by utilizing the structure of human language effectively.The writers suggest a method for extracting relationships based on the "Is A" concept that involves understanding how each descriptor, in a category name relates to the term and using this understanding to find examples of the category from written text. 
The primary accomplishments of this study are the following;  
An approach to extract "Is A" relationships using noun phrase rephrasing techniques, in the context of building a taxonomy. 
Utilizing a semantics framework to tackle two semantic aspects. Giving inherent meaning to a phrase and deliberating on that phrase, within a truth based context. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
The new approach is able to address categories that are not directly stated in the text by integrating information, from several sentences. 
The approach leads to a than 10 point rise in AUC compared to a robust baseline that depends on commonly used Hearst patterns; this illustrates its efficacy, in filling detailed classes with examples. 
The writers extensively assess their approach by conducting an analysis that involves manually re analyzing the test dataset to determine the actual precision and performing a precision recall assessment to showcase the balance, between accurate detections and false alarms. 
The drawbacks of this document are; 
The approach is based on a collection of information gathered from text sources that might not always be accessible or precise. 
The writers believe that modifiers are generally subsective in nature; however this assumption may not always hold true and could restrict the methods effectiveness, in situations. 
The technique might not work effectively for categories that have a number of examples or instances that are not adequately showcased in the text. 
Queries directed towards writers; 
How do the writers intend to deal with modifiers that're not fully descriptive and what impact will this have the methods effectiveness? 
Could the authors offer information, about the process of manually reannotating the data and how it was utilized to determine the actual precision values? 
How do the writers intend to expand on this research to address intricate class labels like ones, with multiple headers or descriptors?
