This research introduces a method for resolving zero pronouns through the automated creation of extensive pseudo training datasets and the use of a two stage training process, with an attention based neural network model highlighting the key advancements made in this study;  
Generating ample pseudo training data is a impactful approach to address the challenge of sparse annotated data when resolving zero pronouns at scale. 
Using a method that involves two stages of training utilizing both simulated training data and data to the task to enhance the efficiency of the model. 
A neural network model that focuses on attention and can accurately understand the connections, between the document and query. 
The advantages of this document are; 
The suggested method excels in achieving top tier results on the Ontonotes 5.o dataset by showcasing an enhancement of 3.l %, in F score precision. 
The model can leverage pseudo training data and a two step training method to gain insights from data sets and tailor its learning to the specific task, at hand. 
The neural network model that focuses on attention is successful, at understanding how documents and queries are related to each other. 
This paper has some drawbacks, such, as; 
The models accuracy could be impacted by the pseudo training data quality as it might not always be precise or reflective of the data sources. 
The process of training, in two stages might need adjustment of hyperparameters to attain the best possible results. 
The model may struggle when dealing with words or referring back to distant previous mentions of a topic in a sentence which might affect how well it works in specific situations. 
Questions, for writers; 
Why did you choose the symbol 「blank」 to stand in for the noun or pronoun, in the text and what benefits does this symbol offer? 
Could you please give me information regarding the process of training, in two steps. Specifically mentioning how the top model is chosen during both the pre training and adaptation phases? 
How do you intend to tackle the problem of terms and distant references in your upcoming projects and what solutions do you suggest?
