This research paper presents a deep learning approach for semantic role labeling (also known as SRL) which has demonstrated outstanding performance on the CoNNl 2005 and 2012 datasets.The architecture of the model involves a highway Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi LSTM) coupled with constrained decoding techniques.The authors have thoroughly examined the models capabilities and drawbacks, in their analysis. 
The key accomplishments of this study include; 
A cutting edge deep neural network for complete semantic role labeling is in development. Will come with accessible code and models, for everyones use. 
Detailed examination of errors reveals areas where the models excel and where they encounter challenges; this includes evaluating the coherence of structure and handling dependencies over long distances. 
Future enhancements could be guided by experiments that explore ways to enhance the results further by utilizing parsers and delving into the specifics of when and how they could be applied effectively. 
The paper excels, in the following areas; 
The model performs well on the CoNNL 2005 and 2012 datasets and demonstrates a 10 percent decrease, in errors compared to the previous leading performance level. 
The authors thoroughly examine the strengths and weaknesses of the model by analyzing its errors and performance, across dependencies. 
The paper discusses how syntactic parsers can enhance the models effectiveness and presents findings that illustrate the advantages of utilizing both manual and automatic syntax analysis. 
The paper has its shortcomings ; 
Training the model demands computational resources that could potentially restrict its usability, in certain scenarios. 
The authors did not thoroughly compare their model to advanced models available, in the field; this lack of comparison makes assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the model challenging. 
The paper expects the reader already knows about SRL and deep learning basics which might be hard, for those not well versed in these subjects. 
Questions, for writers; 
Could you share information, about how the models effectiveness changes based on the accuracy of the input language structure? 
How are you going to handle the challenge of acquiring computational resources for training the model? 
Could you offer comparisons, with other top notch models to help us grasp the strengths and limitations of the model more effectively?
