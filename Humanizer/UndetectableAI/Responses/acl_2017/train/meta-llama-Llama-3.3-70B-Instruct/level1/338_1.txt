This study introduces a neural network architecture designed to identify fake reviews, in situations where a new reviewer submits only one review and there is limited information available to work with effectively.The model combines behavioral data to create review embeddings that capture intricate overarching meanings and store hidden characteristics of the reviewers. 
The primary accomplishments of this research include; 
A suggestion has been made for a network model that combines textual and behavioral data to identify fake reviews in a scenario where there is limited existing information available. 
Utilizing a neural network (CNN) the system learns how to interpret the available reviews effectively by capturing intricate global semantic details. 
Utilizing a Translational Embedding (Trans E) learning model, for capturing behavioral data within the system to store latent characteristics of reviewers effectively. 
The paper excels, in the following aspects; 
The suggested model shows results, in identifying fake reviews in new situations by enhancing both F measure and precision compared to conventional language and behavior characteristics. 
The model shows adaptability in different domains such, as hotels and restaurants while maintaining good performance levels. 
Utilizing a CNN to grasp the essence of the reviews proves efficient in capturing intricate global semantic details. 
The incorporation of behavioral data into the system proves efficient, in capturing the latent traits of the reviewers. 
The suggested approach can be used with an amount of data without supervision, in a practical manner. 
The papers limitations include; 
The effectiveness of the suggested model depends heavily on the accuracy of the training data; it might not function efficiently if the training data contains errors or is skewed. 
The model needs an amount of computing power for training purposes and this could pose a challenge, for certain applications. 
The model being considered might struggle to identify review spam that's extremely clever or employs advanced methods to avoid detection. 
The assessment criteria discussed in the paper might not cover all aspects thoroughly; it could be beneficial to incorporate metrics, like precision and recall to assess the models performance effectively. 
The paper would be improved by providing a thorough examination of the findings and addressing the models constraints along with potential directions, for future research. 
Questions, for writers; 
What does the suggested model do when the new reviewer doesn't have any reviewers with characteristics, in the training data set? 
Is it possible to utilize the suggested model for detecting forms of spam, like comment spam or identifying fake news? 
How would the suggested model deal with situations, in which the fake reviewsre very intricate or employ advanced methods to avoid detection? 
Is it possible to apply the suggested model in real world scenarios, like identifying reviews immediately after they are published? 
How is the suggested model dealing with situations when the training data contains errors or is influenced by biases?
