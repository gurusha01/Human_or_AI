In this study a new method is suggested for identifying relationships in Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) an aspect for numerous natural language processing applications. The researchers present a Hierarchical Residual Bi LSTM (HR Bi LSTM) a recurrent neural network with residual learning to detect relationships, in KB based on a given question. Key highlights of this research include; 
The new relation detection model called HR BiLISTM surpasses existing approaches in identifying relationships in knowledge bases and sets records in accuracy, for both single relation (SimpleQuestions dataset)" and multi relation (WebQP dataset)" question answering tests. 
The authors suggest a matching method that matches the given question to representations, at both the word level and relation level to enable the model to grasp various levels of abstraction. 
Utilizing learning in the HR BiLSMT model allows for training more complex structures and enhances the accuracy of identifying relationships, in tasks. 
The highlights of this document are; 
The advanced HR BiLTSM model has delivered results on the SimpleQuestions and WebQP benchmarks. Showcasing the effectiveness of this approach, in achieving top notch outcomes. 
Enhanced relationship identification is achieved through the matching method and residual learning in the models design which enhances its ability to grasp the connections, between questions and relationships resulting in better detection performance of relationships. 
The authors suggest a KBQA system that combines entity linking and relation detection, for easy construction and effective operation. 
The paper has some shortcomings, such, as; 
The authors did not thoroughly examine error cases to pinpoint areas that need improvement further. 
The model depends on existing word embeddings that might not be accessible or appropriate, for certain fields or languages. 
The authors only tested their model on two datasets, SimpleQuestions and Web QSP which might not accurately reflect all KBQA tasks and datasets. 
Dear Authors we have an inquiries, for you; 
How do the writers intend to deal with situations where the model doesn't recognize the relationship or entity? 
Could the writers offer information about the pre existing word embeddings utilized in the model and elaborate, on their selection process? 
Are there any intentions to test the model, on KBQA datasets or tasks to show how well it can adapt to various scenarios?
