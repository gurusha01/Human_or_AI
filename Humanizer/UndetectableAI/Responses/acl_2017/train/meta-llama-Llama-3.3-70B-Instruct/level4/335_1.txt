This research introduces a method for understanding text and answering questions by using a specialized recurrent neural network design, with gated attention features. To overcome the shortcomings of this structure in capturing context information the authors introduce a self matching attention technique. The system employs pointer networks guided by question focused vectors to predict answer locations accurately. Testing on the SQuAD dataset shows performance compared to recent approaches. 
The document is structured nicely. Written in a clear manner while effectively presenting the technical information.There is a foundation in the mathematical equations presented in the work.This piece sparks interest. Could make a substantial impact, on the field of question answering. 
Releasing the implementation code could help more people adopt and validate the approach better in the realm of improvement suggestion to consider details about the implementation framework. Like specific libraries or tools such, as Theano or CUDA. Which could benefit readers seeking more information. 
To enhance the accuracy of the outcomes more effectively would be to perform a statistical significance assessment to highlight the strength of the discoveries further. Additionally assessing the model, on datasets could offer a broader confirmation of the method; however this might be limited by space considerations.
