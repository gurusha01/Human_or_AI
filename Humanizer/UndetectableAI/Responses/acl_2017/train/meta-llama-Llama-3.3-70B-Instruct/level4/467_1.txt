The study suggests a way to create dual language word connections from extensive single language data sets with just a few initial cross language mappings that can be automatically acquired. The outcomes obtained are quite impressive. Stand out notably due to the techniques minimal need, for manual intervention or data input; surpassing advanced methods that depend heavily on comprehensive bilingual dictionaries or parallel/comparable datasets. 
One downside of the paper is that it doesn't delve into the methods error rates and possible steps to reduce these errors. 
Further investigation of the technique prompts a number of inquiries;. Does the prevalence of base words in single language datasets influence the results?. Observing the progression of word connections across languages, for specific terms may offer valuable perspectives.. Moreover investigating how the method deals with words having interpretations or translations requires additional scrutiny. 
The variations in language structures across languages present intriguing hurdles to overcome. For instance the abundance of compound words, in German offers a unique challenge to explore and understand further. 
In the end it would be really enlightening to explore the capabilities of this method and examine mistakes like words that are quite far off, from their expected positions. Talking about where these errors come from and suggesting ways to fix them in the suggested framework would make the paper even stronger.
