Discussion
Advantages; 
The suggested study utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) on transcripts of speech that include stories and explanations to pinpoint individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) a category falling under ICD 10 code F06 7 The researchers claim they can distinguish between control participants and MCI patients as mentioned in lines 141 to 144 However the conclusion in lines 781 to 785 moderates this positivity by highlighting an accuracy range of 60 percent to 85 percent This suggests difficulties in differentiating between individuals, with cognitive function and those experiencing cognitive impairments The inconsistency, between the information and the final remarks piques interest and prompts a thorough review of the research approach and results. 
The dataset consists of 20 individuals in health and 20 control group members for a total of 40 participants; however it is restricted by being in Portuguese which makes it hard for non Portuguese speakers to access it easily.To enhance the articles comprehensibility and accessibility to an audience adding more technological information, like providing an English translation of a brief excerpt as an example and maybe introducing a sample network with embeddings would greatly improve its clarity and accessibility. 
Areas of improvement; 
The paper starts off by delving into an introduction and examining relevant literature in detail; however some references might be considered for removal to streamline the focus on the papers main topic more effectively. It is recommended to shorten the five pages by highlighting technological advancements and showcasing English translation samples from narratives like those found in the ABCD and/or Cinderella datasets instead of including broader NLP background references (like Salton 1989 in section 4. 23). Unrelated topics such as sentiment classification and pedestrian detection, in images (lines 652–654). 
The inclusion of stories in Portuguese texts within the ABCD dataset sparks inquiries into the methods used to establish word similarities for forming word embeddings.However the authors fail to indicate where they obtained the continuous word representations used in creating word level networks (lines 272–289). Likewise the lack of clarity regarding the training origin of word level ( n grams ) networks for generating word embeddings ( lines 513–525 ) raises questions, about their approach. It's not clear if merging these two types of networks actually enhances accuracy or what exactly ", out of vocabulary words " as mentioned in line 516 mean. 
Lets have a chat about something, in general.
Studying NLP to uncover issues is vital and adds an intriguing dimension to this papers content." Furthermore " its emphasis on NLP for Portuguese fills a void since resources for this language are fewer compared to English." Explaining the process of computing embeddings, for these languages is an aspect that warrants further elaboration."
The text needs to be revised by shortening sections 4 and 5 and providing experimental information in section 6 while clarifying the transcription standards, for NURBSP N338 EF and N331 D5. 
Technical Feedback; 
Line 029 should say "… like a lightweight…" of "…as it a lightweight…". 
Line 188 needs to be adjusted to "natural language processing ( NLP )" of "PLAIN LANGUAGE".
Line 264 needs to be revised as it contains words ("out of cookie, out of the cookie") that require correction. 
In Table 3s row and third column area of data marked as "72 point zero " needs adjustment to display as "72 decimal zero " to maintain consistency. 
In lines 995 to 996 and 1005 to 1006 of the document are the DOI numbers listed twice with a mistake in the link attached to the title in lines 992, to 993 leading to a different paper than intended.
