This study introduces an approach that combines selecting important phrases and predicting relationships in spoken meetings while showcasing better results compared with an SVM based classifier, in tests conducted on meeting data collections. 
Strengths include; 
The paper is organized in an easy to understand manner and includes detailed technical information while demonstrating strong results in practical tests as well as offering interesting comparisons with previous studies on analyzing discourse structure and identifying key phrases effectively The study not only assesses how well phrases are chosen and relations within discourse are labeled or summaries are generated but also delves into predicting the team members’ agreement in understanding – a significant addition, to the field.
