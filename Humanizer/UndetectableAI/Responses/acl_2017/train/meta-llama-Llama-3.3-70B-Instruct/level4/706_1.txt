The authors reply is much appreciated. I'm looking forward to delving deeper into how incentives and language ambiguity play a role, in this area. 
At glance I saw the paper as suggesting an innovative method, for creating natural language interfaces by allowing a team of users to introduce fresh ideas and sentence structures expanding on the research done by S.I. Wang, P. Liang and C. Manning in 2016 on learning language games through collaboration. 
My first questions included; 
What range of words did they use in this research? 
Could we connect this study to the context of inverse reinforcement learning and imitation learning to better explain its significance? 
The paper showcases strengths, including...
The clear and organized way it is presented. 
It provides an approach, to handling the challenges of understanding natural language interfaces across a wide range of different programs.
However, 
The conversation could be enhanced by examining how incentives impact the effectiveness of the approach, in practice.Were different incentive frameworks explored and what were the results of exploration? 
The paper mentions the possibility of applying the research to real world settings but points out the need to delve deeper into the practicality and difficulties of implementing it due to issues, like vocabulary and language ambiguities that were not fully covered in the experiments conducted so far. 
Adding an example or a real life scenario would greatly improve the credibility and effectiveness of the paper.
