The manuscript examines approaches to creating word representations for sentiment analysis tasks by comparing the effects of using various datasets and blending task specific and general data sources.. The authors illustrate that employing a dataset in subjective material can generate more impactful word representations compared to solely relying on the largest dataset available.. Additionally they prove that merging word representations, from task general datasets can outshine those created from a single dataset with tests carried out in both English and Catalan languages..
The paper excels, in its organized presentation and effectively delves into a crucial element of sentiment analysis The authors provide ample evidence to back up their assertions through their experimental findings. 
On the hand multiple flaws have been identified.The results from the experiments tend to be expected and the approaches used are fairly basic and improvised.The research lacks insights and the insights gained from analyzing embeddings and sentiment are not particularly notable.The central idea of concentratingon task data to refine embeddings for better accuracy has been discussed before in relation, to named entity recognition.This papers contributions mainly build upon existing work. 
Some trials yield results as statistical significance tests were not conducted across various classifier models used in the analysis process​. The outcomes presented in Tables 2​ and 6 exhibit comparable performance metrics, for classifier setups​​​; hence distinguishing significant differences without conducting statistical significance tests becomes challenging. The progress made by concentrating on aspects based on personal views seems reasonable; however its real world usefulness in situations with limited resources is doubtful specially considering the need for initial steps like OpinionFinder that might not be viable in languages other, than English. 
There are some problems such as unclear explanations about datasets and versions of "splicing" that lack proper motivation and subjective information not clearly separated out in the document Also not consistent variable definitions and formulas are present along, with vague task descriptions. 
Upon reviewing the feedback from the authors and receiving some clarifications on points raised; however the explanations regarding who holds opinions and the specific targets of interest were still not entirely clear to me. In the end though; due, to a perceived lack of insights and the incremental nature of the study presented in the manuscript. It was determined that a revision was not warranted for an updated evaluation score.
