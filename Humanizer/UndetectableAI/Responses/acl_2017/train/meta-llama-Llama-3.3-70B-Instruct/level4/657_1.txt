This study delves into the issue of understanding how Long Short Term Memory (LTSMs) a type of network model used for categorizing written justifications in value affirmation essays â€“ a topic that sparks curiosity in the research community.The authors aim to draw on methods from psychology and substantiate sociological beliefs, in their work.  
However a critical flaw of the paper lies in the objectives it presents The overarching aim of applying experimental psychology methods to decipher LSTMs is ambitious yet the methodology to accomplish this is not clearly explained Alternatively if the goal is to validate sociological assumptions it would be more impactful to analyze the connections between gender markers and written explanations without relying on any model The assertion regarding anticipated gender variances based on theories of gendered self construal lacks support, from the study 
While the study is engaging overall it suffers from some points in its arguments. Just because theres a correlation between how a tokens probability changes, in an LSTM network and the SVM coefficients doesn't definitively show that these probabilities are a way of understanding the model. This is because SVM coefficients only give a view of how an SVM classifier makes decisions and just because one model has a correlated coefficient doesn't mean it explains another model. Furthermore the correlation coefficients aren't strong enough supports the argument being put forward. 
One key problem with the paper seems to be that the authors are not clear about their goal and seem torn between two objectives; it would be more effective if they focused on one clearly defined aim instead of being ambiguous about their intentions. In terms of its relevance, to psychology. An important aspect highlighted in the paper. It would be helpful if the authors could delve deeper into and offer a more detailed explanation of the multilevel Bayesian models employed to measure assumptions related to gender based self construal. The methodology used needs specifics for a proper assessment since its a crucial aspect that requires further explanation.
