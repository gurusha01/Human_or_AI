Advantages; 
The writers utilize known neural network methods such as adversarial networks (as described by Goodfellows et al in NIPS 2014) to examine eight different Chinese word segmentation test collections that each have their unique way of defining a word in Chinese language.This method could have implications for different natural language processing tasks where the concept of accuracy may differ.The use of Goodfellows et als approach provides an outlook on tackling the issue of adjusting to varying standards, than what traditional adaptation techniques offer.It has the potential to be an effective solution. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The issue we're dealing with requires a term to capture its essence; "the elusive gold standard" seems more fitting than using "multi criteria." The reasoning put forth in the paper appears quite limited since the challenge of establishing a standard extends to various contexts, beyond just Chinese Word Segmentation alone. Moreover the rationale assumes that the reader is well acquainted with language and culture which may not always be the case.Non Chinese speakers might underestimate the intricacies of language assuming it to be simpler than it actually is. The key point mentioned in Table 1 about the potential for differing opinions among Chinese speakers could be better emphasized by recognizing that this challenge is not exclusive to Chinese Word Segmentation alone. In reality several NLP tasks, including machine translation, information retrieval and web search naturally present valid solutions because of the subjective nature of assessment criteria. Moreover tasks, like part of speech tagging frequently encounter difficulties establishing a gold standard, which can impede advancements in the field. When human annotators have conflicting viewpoints or perspectives on a topic itâ€™s seen as a difference in opinion; however when a machine presents differing views its usually perceived as an error in processing information than just a matter of perspective or interpretation like humans do.This NIPS papers use of the term "adversary" might not be the suitable approach, for describing disagreements among individuals as it carries connotations of competition or opposition which may not accurately reflect the nature of the elusive gold standard issue that involves accommodating diverse viewpoints and interpretations. The papers impact could be strengthened by stating that the method, from NIPS is being used to tackle the challenging gold standard issue and recognizing the wider relevance of this problem. 
Lets talk about topics; 
The article was a bit hard to understand because the reviewer wasn't very familiar with Chinese and NIPS concepts. There were also some problems with how English was used and explained in the paper that could be worked upon. For example Table 4 needs a look to back up the claims about the initial block and network depth. Terms, like P, R and F are expected to mean precision recall and the F measure but providing explanations would be helpful. The sheer volume of data in Table 4 sparks inquiries about its importance. How it can be compared across different categories as well as the effectiveness of the measures utilized. The assertion regarding a resolution to the challenging gold standard predicament highlighted on line 794 requires more explicit backing, from the information laid out in Table 4. Minor recommendations for enhancement involve rectifying "works" to "work" as needed since "work" is a mass noun. Making specific line edits, like using "each dataset" instead of "each datasets " and "randomizing" instead of "random."
