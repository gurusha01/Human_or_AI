Synopsis 
This document delves into uncover an emotional aspect in word representations, through a practical study. 
Areas of expertise
 The research focuses on the problem of sentiment analysis without supervisionâ€”a significant obstacle, in this field. 
 The illustration shown in Figure 1 does a job of displaying the findings effectively. 
Areas, for improvement
 The studys experimental aspect is somewhat. Could be improved by including more measurements like the F score and conducting a wider range of comparisons, between different techniques to make it more reliable. 
 The methodology section needs explanation and structure because the concepts that were tested are listed but not adequately justified or explained. 
 The findings presented show accuracy and thorough analysis which implies that the study might need additional refinement to confirm the fundamental belief that the Distributional Hypothesis results in the differentiation of opposite words, in the vector field even though they share semantic similarities.
