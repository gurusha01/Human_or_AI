This document introduces a tool created to simplify the evaluation of written examinations. 
**Pros;**
The document delves into using a NLP problem called textual entailment in the important area of grading written tests which demonstrates an intriguing blend of natural language processing and educational evaluation. 
Shortcomings; 
The manuscript falls short in terms of originality since it mainly relies on established methods to address a familiar issue without offering fresh approaches or perspectives. 
The method described in the paper isn't entirely self sufficient as it requires involvement for the scoring procedure itself; additionally lacking is a detailed evaluation of the systems effectiveness either quantitatively or qualitatively which raises uncertainties about its impact on streamlining the scorers responsibilities or improving their efficiency, over traditional manual scoring techniques. 
The system consists of parts; however; the impact of each part towards the systems effectiveness and user satisfaction remains unclearly explained.The language and style, in sections could also use enhancement as they appear somewhat basic. 
Adding instances as illustrations might not significantly improve the conversation and could be adjusted for a more effective outcome instead. Additionally it is crucial to set a standard like predicting the common category when assessing classification performance to provide context for the accuracy of the system. 
Lets talk about it in general.
After reading through this manuscript I feel that it lacks the essence of inspiration. The main idea behind the creation of this system isn't effectively communicated hintin' that a bit more polish could bring out its importance and impact, in the field.
