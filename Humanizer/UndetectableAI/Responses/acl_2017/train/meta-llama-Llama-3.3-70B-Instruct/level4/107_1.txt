This document suggests semi guided methods for identifying named entities in (NER) using translation methods from English to other languages to enhance the process. While the overall structure is not entirely new or innovative the specific techniques introduced offer advancements over current practices.However in a known publication, like ACL it would be reasonable to expect more significant breakthroughs. 
One interesting feature of this study is how they chose their data for analysis.The formula used to calculate the quality score is simple. Can be viewed as a good thing.However the method of setting thresholds mentioned in Table 2 is not very clear.The paper talks, about trying out thresholds but does not mention if this was done on a specific test group making it hard to replicate the methodology. The results of the assessment highlight the importance of choosing data however; it is still unclear how to best adjust these settings for new sets of data or different languages. 
The collaboration of results, from both systems discussed in the document is another aspect of the research papers contribution; however the description of this procedure is unclear and makes it difficult to grasp its practical workings. 
The study delves into versions of each suggested technique and poses queries regarding the advantages of integrating more than two loosely supervised systems together.It remains uncertain if the authors delved into this possibility to gain understanding, about how scalable and reliable their method is. 
It would be helpful to have details, about the content and features of the dataset created internally in order to fully grasp the context and relevance of the research.
