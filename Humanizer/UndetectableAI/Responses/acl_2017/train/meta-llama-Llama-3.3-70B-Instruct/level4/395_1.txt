This document suggests an approach to developing sense embeddings from collections using a methodical sense extraction and representation procedure. The process involves communication, between the two parts facilitated through a message passing system and framed as a reinforcement learning challenge according to the authors. 
"Advantages;"
The paper is well organized and effectively presents its ideas while also drawing comparisons to existing research work, in a manner.The experimental setup is solid. The findings are mostly satisfactory though not outstanding.However some shortcomings exist that diminish the quality of the paper prompting some reservations in fully supporting it. 
Shortcomings; 
One major issue is overstating the arguments of the paper beyond their true importance. 
The writers use the word "in the title and, throughout the paper but they use a skip gram structure which isnâ€™t deep which leads to misinterpretation. 
Furthermore the paper emphasizes the significance of reinforcement learning; however the rationale, behind it and how it is executed are not clearly explained. In Section 3. Adesire to present the task as a reinforcement learning challenge is made butit later admits two limitations resulting in the adoption of a Q learning algorithm that deviates from the original policy that was asserted initially. 
Furthermore expressed is the uncertainty surrounding the originality of the method since it shares similarities with EM learning strategies that involve selecting an optimal sense during the E step and optimizing an objective during the M step to enhance sense representations effectively. The authors do not sufficiently differentiate their method. Do not offer a convincing rationale for favoriting reinforcement learning, over EM techniques. 
The writers often refer to "pure sense representations " highlighting it as an aspect of their work; however the exact significance and advantages remain ambiguous. 
They say their model can select senses in time but haven't provided a clear explanation to support this claim yet; it would be helpful to emphasize this point in the appropriate part of the document. 
The authors state that they have attained cutting edge outcomes; however this applies solely to the MaxSimc measure.Others have demonstrated overall findings with the AvgSimc measure.Citing state of the art performance as mentioned in the abstract and introduction may be somewhat deceiving.
