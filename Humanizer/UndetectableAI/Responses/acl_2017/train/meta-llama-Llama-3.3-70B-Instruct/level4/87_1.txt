The paper is well laid out with an easy, to follow storyline that makes it simple to understand the research questions answered using a set of focused experiments. 
However one drawback of this study is its originality as it does not introduce any groundbreaking ideas.The idea of using the " sentence" principle has long been recognized in the field of summarization literature.This study adapts an enhanced form of this principle for keyword extraction; although this adaptation is not simple, in nature it does not significantly innovate the field with concepts. 
One more flaw is the lack of comparison to the cutting edge methods available currently in the field. Assessing the systems performance against benchmarks gives us some understanding but fails to conclusively prove its superiority, over existing state of the art techniques. This absence somewhat reduces the impact of the paper. 
Overall I found the paper to be well done. Would suggest that it be published and presented. However for their research to be more robust the authors should compare their systems performance to that of recent studies like Martinez Romo et al.' s SemGraph. Le et al.' s work, on keyphrase extraction. This comparison would give an insight into how their work contributes to the field.
