Advantages; 
The approaches outlined in this document provide benefits in terms of saving memory and improving decoding speed on CPUs accomplishing this without significant loss, in performance quality. 
Areas, for improvement; 
One crucial point that requires investigation is the identification of convolutional codes in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 since it directly impacts the overall performance of the model. Additionally and importantly stated in the summary is that the suggested model attains translation accuracies similar to softmax. With a notable reduction in memory usage and enhancement, in CPU decoding speed; however this statement lacks thorough validation. In particular tests done with the ASPEC dataset using the "Binary" and "Hybridâ€“512" configurations show an increase, in decoding speed; however the resulting BLEUt scores are relatively low which casts doubt upon the conclusions drawn from these experiments. 
Lets chat about this topic, in general.
This paper presents a method for predicting translations in neural machine translation by using binary codes for each word to simplify the prediction process effectively and efficiently.The authors suggest an approach that incorporates error correcting binary codes to enhance prediction accuracy and a combined softmax/binary model to achieve a good balance, between accuracy and efficiency.These methods help save memory and speed up decoding without sacrificing performance quality making it an impressive research article.
