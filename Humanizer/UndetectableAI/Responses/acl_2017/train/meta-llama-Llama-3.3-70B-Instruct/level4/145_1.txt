Examining the Distribution of Words Across Multiple Modes
Strengths of this study include an organized method for understanding the distribution of words, in different modes effectively. 
Weaknesses identified in the paper could be addressed by conducting a thorough comparison, with similar methods thereby boosting its credibility further. 
Lets talk about topics.
This article presents a method for illustrating multimodal word distributions through Gaussian mixtures skillfully capturing various meanings of words through a collection of Gaussian distributions, in an innovative way that builds upon Vilnis and McCallums (2014) unimodal Gaussian distribution model to tackle the challenge of polysemy by employing a multimodal representation. 
The document is nicely. Easy to follow with detailed experiments to support its claims.The qualitative assessment presented in Table 1 shows the outcomes and proves the approachs efficacy.These remarks aim to offer ideas for enhancing clarity and refining the content further. 
Some important factors to take into account; 
Both the current method and the one by Tian et al. from 2014 use mixture models to break down single word representations, into prototypes; hence a quick comparison discussing their variances would be helpful. 
The section on research could benefit from including references, to relevant studies cited in the following manner; 
Efficient estimation without parameters of embeddings per word in vector space by Neelakantan and colleagues at the EMNL conference, in 2014. 
"Are Multi Sensory Embeddings Enhancing Comprehension of Natural Language?" as discussed by Li and Jurafsky at EMWLP 2015. 
Liu and colleagues presented their research, on Topic Word Embeddings at the AAI conference in 2015. 
Adding the outcomes of these methods to Tables 3 and 4 might offer valuable perspectives. 
Authors, what aspects lead to the variance in performance, between wTGM and wTG in the SWCS examination? 
The feedback, from the writers has been considered.
