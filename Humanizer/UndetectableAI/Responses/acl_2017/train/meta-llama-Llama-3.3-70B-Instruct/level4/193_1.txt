This article introduces a way of using UCCA as the main focus for semantic parsing and pairs it with a very efficient transition based parser for drawing conclusions.The incorporation of UCCA into this field is an addition that could lead to new insights into how semantic text representations can be approached.The suggested model is thoughtfully. Includes sensible enhancements to established transition based methods, with explanations that are easy to follow and detailed enough. 
The practical assessment is quite compelling. Shows positive outcomes when compared to reputable benchmarks in various fields of study. Nevertheless one key drawback is the lack of assessment in languages especially considering the broad applicability of the framework under examination. The availability of UCCA datasets, like the "20K leagues" dataset used in this research hints at the advantages of testing the models effectiveness in languages besides English. 
The authors mentioning their model as "grammarless" in section 6 might be a bit deceiving because even though UCCAs approach isn't based on grammar concepts it does provide a way to create a structured abstract representation of text that can be seen as a type of grammar.This is a point but worth noting.
