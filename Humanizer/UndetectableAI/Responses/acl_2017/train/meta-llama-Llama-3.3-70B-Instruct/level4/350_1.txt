Advantages; 
The suggested method shows progress compared to the advancements and its techniques could be useful, in various other areas as well. 
Areas needing improvement; 
The approach doesn't bring anything to the table and its not clear if the data set used can be applied effectively in different areas. 
Lets talk about topics; 
This research paper introduces a method based on rules for creating weakly labeled data for event extraction in three main steps; First of all it uses Freebase to find important slot fillers for matching sentences in Wikipedia since using all slot fillers would be too limiting and lead to a lack of matches; then it uses FrameNet to improve the accuracy of labeling trigger verbs and identify nominal triggers; lastly it applies multi instance learning to deal with the errors, in the training data generated. 
This paper stands out for its capability to enhance the best practices in a significant benchmark area that is quite challenging to tackle effectively and transparently explains the rules involved in potential utility for professionals looking to improve information extraction systems in various fields. However it still necessitates some work,such as align Freebase event categories, with ACE event categories as noted in Section 5 point three line five seventy eight. The need for involvement also poses obstacles for future research to make a direct comparison, with this paper difficult.. Additionally the methods lack of originality is a worry..
I have some thoughts to share.
"I am also worried about how this method could work in different areas of study." In Section 2 of the document at line 262 it mentions that 21 event types are chosen from Freebase database. Its not clear how these compare to the 33 event types, in the ACE data."
The paper is mostly well written; however there are areas that could be refined for clarity and accuracy. In Section 3; specifically line 316 could benefit from rephrasing "arguments liked time and location " to "arguments involving time and location " for understanding. Moreover small errors like the absence of "that‚Äù, in line 357're present but do not pose significant issues.
