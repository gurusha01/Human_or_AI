The report highlights a number of advantages, such, as the use of a kernel based method that accurately detects complex patterns that differentiate between different kinds of rumors based on analyzing the similarities in their propagation structures. 
One area that could be improved is the clarity of the explanations in Section 4, for easier understanding. 
Generally speaking, suggesting a propagation tree kernel is quite impactful as this allows the identification of patterns that distinguish between various types of rumors by examining how similar their propagation tree structures are. This approach shows enhancements, in both the efficiency and precision of rumor identification when compared to current cutting edge methods. 
To improve the accessibility and reproducibility of the research findings and benefit the research community at large it would be ideal to publicly release the dataset used in the study. 
Furthermore the document needs a review to fix typos like the ones identified at pages 326 and 3277 ("any subgraph which have" should be "any subgraph which has") page 472 ("TP K" should be "PT K”) and page 644 ("Table 2 show" should be "Table 2 shows”). There are also cases where essential information's absent—, for example the publication details of a referenced work are missing from page 875. Moreover on examination of pages 822 and 897,the discrepancies, in formatting should be rectified.Finally the size of Figure 5 appears small and could be increased to improve its visibility and comprehensibility.
