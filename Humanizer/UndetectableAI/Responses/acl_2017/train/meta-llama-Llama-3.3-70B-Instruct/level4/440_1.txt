The strengths of this paper are clearly seen in its expansion of A* CCG parsing to include dependency details while maintaining efficiency and manageability. Quite an impressive feat indeed! The precomputation of attachments proves to be a strategy that enhances the methods effectiveness significantly. Furthermore evaluating the influence of head rules on normal form infringements is praiseworthy and more in depth analysis, on the remaining scenarios would be advantageous. 
However there are some areas that need to be focused upon. A deeper analysis of dependency patterns especially in coordination and relative clauses is needed. It's important to explore how these patterns are managed when the predicate object structure of CCG clashes, with the dependency patterns typically used by parsers. 
In terms of this study are remarkably valuable to the field and I am satisfied with its caliber. To improve the document further I recommend conducting an examination of the structures that showed significant enhancement, in both English and Japanese. Moreover a conversation comparing predicate object relationships to those observed in parsers would offer a more holistic grasp of the method tackling any discrepancies that may arise between CCGs predicate object configuration and the dependency structures employed by other parsers.
