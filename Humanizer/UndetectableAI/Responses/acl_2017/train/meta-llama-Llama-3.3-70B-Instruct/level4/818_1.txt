The authors reply is acknowledged with gratitude as it touches upon my concerns to an extent; nonetheless it mainly comprises assurances, for forthcoming modifications. A requirement imposed by limited space availability.This situation exemplifies the core problem;I wish to assess the updated paper to ensure that the noted shortcomings are adequately rectified.The necessary alterations are significant. The upcoming experimental findings pledged will not undergo evaluation if the paper is approved in its current form.  It's a bit tricky for me to fully trust the authors to handle all the needed revisions without another round of review involved.I've bumped up my rating to a 3 as it shows my feelings. I do admire the creativity, in the research but find the way its presented quite chaotic. 
Advantages; 
The paper explores a creative topic with a valuable goal; extracting shared knowledge from text by addressing the challenge of reporting bias through combined inference on gleanable information, from text. 
Areas of improvement; 
There are parts of the method that need more explanation but what concerns me the most is the lack of clarity on how they combine object knowledge with verb knowledge to address reporting bias effectively in this study paper they jump into technical details without giving a clear overview of the approach or its benefits, from the start. 
The experiments and the discussion seem unfinished because the results for one of the tasks in Table 2 (the half) have not been discussed yet and an important experiment is missing too. Variant B of the authors’ model performs better than Variant A in the first task but only Variant A is tested in the second task and does not show any improvement, over the baseline. 
Lets talk about a things; 
The paper needs a lot of polishing before its ready, for publication. 
I'm sorry. I cannot proceed with the task as you have not provided any text for me to paraphrase. Please provide the text you would like me to work on. Thank you.
On page 26 of the paper it states there are five dimensions noted of six. 
Figure 1 caption raises a question, about the ambiguity of the term "implies relations." The authors are prompted to explain how they discern the physical relations that are implied in this context.
Figures 1 and 113–114 illustrate the method of deriving implied meanings for verbs that align, with semantics principles as outlined by Dowty (1991). Referencing this work directly would enhance the clarity and depth of the discussion. 
On page 135 it is important to explain the idea of the method. The reasons, behind why combining both sets of information through joint inference can address reporting bias effectively. 
On page 141 it should say "value," not "values."
On page 143 of the document it could be beneficial to explore research on distributional semantics and possibly include it in the relevant literature section of the paper for added value.There are studies, by Bruni et al.(2012) and Silberer et al.(2013).
On page 146 of the document is where its important to specify that the focus is on the task and method for extracting common sense knowledge from language since this has been a well established objective, for quite some time. 
On page 152 the meaning of "grounded'' is not clear, at this stage. 
Section 2 point 2 requires an explanation for why specific dimensions were chosen and the reasoning, behind them should be provided. 
On page 177 of the document it is recommended to elaborate on the meanings of "pre condition" and "post condition" well as their significance, in the context provided. 
Pages 197 to 198 could benefit from including an example that shows the distribution, for a particular item, which would help with comprehension. 
In Figure 2 of the text on semantics the difference, between stage level and individual level predicates appears important but lacks clear explanation. 
On page 248 of the book there seems to be a missing determiner, in the definition. 
Section 3 needs explanation regarding the choice of "action verbs " and the criteria for their selection should be clarified regardless of Levins explicit tagging of them, as such. 
On pages 306 and beyond there should be an explanation of how "action frames" are defined and selected or created. 
On page 326 it doesn't mention how to tell if a frame is producing little or too much. 
Table 1 should provide an explanation of how to divide the content (based on frames or verbs) as well, as how verbs or frames can be used in different sections. 
On page 336 of the book mentions PMIs. Lacks specifics, like thresholds. 
On page 371 it is important to mention the approach used for dividing whether done randomly or according to certain criteria. 
On page 376 the expression "evaluating the connection" is not very clear, in its meaning. 
On page 378 it does not specify the criteria used to select which knowledge dimensions should be annotated for each frame. 
Section 4 should provide an overview of the models elements like factor graphs and substrates and explain why this approach is suitable, for a CL audience. 
On page 420 it seems like the reference, for "both types of knowledge" is not provided 
On page 421 the phrase "object of kind" is not very clear. 
Page 445 feels like the selectional preference factors were introduced out of the blue so it might have been better to introduce them earlier, in the paper for clarity and understanding. 
On page 461 the presence of the word "also" appears misplaced or awkward, within the context provided. 
On page 471 it doesn't mention where the similarities, in usage come from. 
Figure 3 may be challenging to comprehend. Could use a clearer written explanation or a more intuitive presentation for better understanding, in black and white format. 
On page 598 it is important to provide a definition of the term "message " and explain its significance, within the factor graph framework. 
On page 621 it would be helpful to provide an explanation, for using a " 1" instead of a firm 1. 
On pages 647 and beyond of the document there should be information provided about the EMB MAXNET classifier such as its training process and the type of input data used for it as well as an explanation, for why it serves as a baseline model. 
On page 654 the expression " information, about seeds" is not very clear. 
On pages 659 and 681 of the document there seems to be a problem, with the table reference; it should actually point to Table 2. 
On pages 664 and beyond, in the text you mentioned earlier. The illustration given might not be ideal because comparing an entity to a revolution is not a task. 
Page 681 mentions the importance of discussing the findings related to understanding object knowledge and including results for model ( B). It would be helpful to use terminology for the model, in Tables 1 and 2. 
Page 778 seems a bit lacking when it mentions "latent in verbs " without any reference, to objects. 
On page 781 it seems that the reference, for "both tasks" is not specified. 
The citations need to be reviewed for consistency in formatting such as capitalization and bibliographic information to the examples, in Grice and Sorower et al.s references.
