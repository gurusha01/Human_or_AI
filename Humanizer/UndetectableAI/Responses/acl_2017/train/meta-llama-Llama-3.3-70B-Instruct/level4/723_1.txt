This study introduces a method for breaking down words into their morphological components by utilizing word embeddings to evaluate the similarity between pairs of words that may have morphological connections at a local level and to consider the overall semantic accuracy of different types of morphological segments globally.The research is well organized. Builds upon previous methods, for morphological segmentation driven by semantics in a significant manner. 
Experiments were carried out on the Morpho Challenge dataset using English and Turkish well as Finnish. Languages known for their varying levels of morphological intricacy. Training data was drawn from Wikipedia for all models employed in the study. The MORSE system put forward showed enhancements in F1 score scores for English and Turkish compared to the Morftessor baseline model. However; it fell short of outperforming Morftessor in terms of performance possibly due, to the complex morphology of the Finnish language causing sparse data and lower word embedding quality. To tackle this issue effectively for languages like Finnish it may be beneficial to integrate word details into word embeddings as demonstrated in studies, by Cao and Rei and Bojanowski et al. 
The writers also provide an analysis of the current Morpho Challenge datasets by pointing out problems like inaccurately divided words and segmentations that used to make sense in the past but are not meaningful anymore today. They also unveil a dataset containing 2000 English word form segmentations based on semantics, from Wikipedia. The MORSE system exhibits enhancements over Morfessor when tested using this new dataset. 
Overall this paper is nicely. Showcases impressive outcomes in the domain of semantically guided morphological segmentation. The addition of the code and a fresh dataset along with the submission notably boosts its significance. Establishes it as a noteworthy addition, to the field.
