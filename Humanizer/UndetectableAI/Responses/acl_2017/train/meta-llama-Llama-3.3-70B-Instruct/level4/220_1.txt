This research paper showcases strengths such as its captivating writing style and interesting findings along with its inventive approach methodology The detailed comparisons made with methods provide valuable information and new perspectives Moreover the carefully annotated dataset is set to be a beneficial resource, for researchers The qualitative assessment outlined in section 5 stands out notably for providing deep insights that enhance the results a feature not commonly found in machine learning papers which tend to focus solely on presenting results
However there are some parts that could use some improvement in section 4 point 1 where the models input is set to zeros isn't very clear until you look at Figure 2 It would be helpful to add another sentence to make it easier to understand Also in Figure 2 there seems to be a possible mistake The input layers for the LSTMs are labeled as "Five times Embeddings (50 D)‚Äù, for networks that use dependency labels as input which seems incorrect Providing clarification or fixing this point would be helpful 
In the conversation at hand here is about the relevance of utilizing LSTMs in section 4 point 2 for modeling language sequences seems out of place this time around For each data point feeding all five words simultaneously into the network and the examples being standalone, from one another doesn't inherently require sequential modeling Even though LSTMs might still deliver better results the reasoning given doesn't really match with the problem at hand It would be helpful to hear from the authors themselves regarding this observation to clear up any confusion.
