Advantages; 
This document addresses a standing issue in the realm of automatically assessing generation and translation systems and makes a valuable addition, to the current research landscape. 
The researchers thoroughly analyze the metrics at their disposal and provide a detailed and, in depth assessment of the present status of the field. 
An innovative measure has been presented that shows a connection with human evaluations and provides an encouraging avenue, for upcoming studies. 
The bibliography provided is a tool for those new to the field as it gives a detailed look, at the relevant literature available. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The paper emphasizes analysis over delving into meaningful conversations about the linguistic aspects of generation such as the generation process itself and comparisons, to references generated by humans. 
The impact of using contributions, from the crowd in language creation tools is still not well. Requires more explanation. 
Lets talk about some topics; 
In order to make the manuscript clearer and easier to read and understand for readers while also improving the impact of the research paper as a whole; it may be helpful to include examples and system descriptions instead of using redundant tables.
