Advantages; 
The idea of dividing document sections with lengths, on related subjects is original and deserves to be included in the LDA based system by utilizing important existing knowledge. 
Although there is a lack of in depth knowledge regarding the literature, on LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) the related work section tells an engaging story. 
The suggested approach to segment selection, with a complexity stands out for its promise to greatly improve computational efficiency. 
Areas needing improvement; 
Compared to the visualization showcased in Balikasâ€™ COLING16 study mentioned on in this paper and the visualization depicted in Figure 5 here seems to be less impactful and raises doubts, about the precision of document segmentation and topic assignment outcomes presented therein. To strengthen the argument made in the paper regarding this matter it could be beneficial to improve the visualization by incorporating samples and employing a uniform color scheme that corresponds with the topics outlined in Figure 4. 
The proposed model offers flexibility compared to the COLING16 model by Balikas but may face a risk of underfitting due to this enhancement. Providing a detailed explanation, on this issue would be helpful. 
Lets chat about topics; 
The paper showcases writing and a well structured layout with clear explanations in the Abstract and Introduction that are convincing.The experiments are thorough. Show significant improvement in quantitative results compared to previous studies.Additional focus could be placedon enhancing the visualization or providing reasons for its status to boost confidence in the conclusions.It would also be intriguing to see how the authors may address advancements related to computational efficiency in reference, to the influential LDA work that used Variational Inference for quicker training times compared to MCMC.
