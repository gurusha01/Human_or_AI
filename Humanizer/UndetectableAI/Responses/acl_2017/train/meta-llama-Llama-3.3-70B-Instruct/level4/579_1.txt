Assessment
Advantages; 
The article discusses an issue and offers a well thought out strategy to reduce extractions, in Open Information Extraction (OI`E`) systems. 
The text is concise and well structured with supporting code and data provided for reference. 
The outcomes look promising. Show that the suggested Minimally Supervised Open Information Extraction technique is effective. 
Areas that need improvement; 
The Minimally Overlapping Interval Enumeration (Min OIE) method depends on fixed and manual minimization guidelines that could potentially restrict its ability to scale and adapt effectively. 
The article overlook studies on Open Information Extraction (OIE) especially the recent research focus, on semantically driven OIE initiatives. 
The experimental assessment is well. Could benefit from more thoroughness by incorporating extra datasets and comparing it with other OIE systems. 
Lets talk about some things. 
This study addresses the real world problem of inaccurate extractions, in Open Information Extraction (IE) systems.The Minimized Open IE (MinIE) method seeks to reduce extractions by excluding detailed segments and converting them into organized annotations.The researchers combine MinIE with a cutting edge Open IE system called ClausIE and test its performance on two accessible datasets to show how well it generates concise extractions without sacrificing accuracy. 
Nevertheless the fixed and predictable framework of MinOIE raises doubts regarding its ability to expand and innovate.The utilization of crafted regulations much as they are accurate may not be the most effective tactic for extensive applications.The document could see improvements by investigating methods,such, as acquiring minimization rules through learning rather than embedding them in a rigid manner. 
Moreover the authors fail to consider studies on semantically driven Open Information Extraction (OIЕ) incorporating conventional extractions with connections to underlying knowledge bases and meanings indexes. This oversight is important because integrating entity linking and meanings indexes could help decrease the necessity, for ad reduction regulations. The experimental assessment could also be enhanced by adding datasets like the ОIЕ benchmark created by Stanovsky and Dagan in 2016 and contrasting MinОIЕ with other ОIЕ systems to gauge its adaptability as a post processing tool. 
In general although the paper introduces a compelling and thoughtfully considered strategy to reduce extractions in Open Information Extraction (OIE) systems it lacks originality and depth because it heavily relies on rules and overlooks pertinent references. By enhancing the methodology and conducting experiments this study could have a greater impact, on the advancement of the field of Open Information Extraction.
