This document offers an solid investigation that builds upon previous research in a significant way that is easy to understand and follow due, to its clear and succinct writing style.  
To enhance the quality of writing in certain areas one could consider steering clear of somewhat general statements like the ones identified on pages 191 and 537 that might benefit from more precise wording adjustments.For instance on page 191 there is a discussion about customizing the scoring function to give priority to terms used similarly in contexts and on page 537 there is mention of the educational significance of comparing annotations, from identical datasets to pinpoint both commonalities and distinctions. 
In the beginning sections of the studys methodology appeared similar to past methods used in the last twenty five years, for measuring similarity but with some new statistical tweaks added in. As I delved into Section 5 though it became clear that this work brings an valuable element that will surely aid future studies in this field. Looking back the fundamental concepts discussed in Sections 2 to 4 offer background that supports the experiments described in Section 5 even if it didn't appear immediately necessary at first glance. 
The insights and discoveries discussed in this document will be valuable to professionals in the field and merit consideration for presentation, at ACL.  
A few small ideas for making it better; check the punctuation and phrasing in section 264 where explaining word notes with PPMI and different types of word vectors like SVD and SGNS could be made clearer; also elaborate further on the term "various methods" in section 278 by detailing which particular techniques are meant in relation, to CCLA.
