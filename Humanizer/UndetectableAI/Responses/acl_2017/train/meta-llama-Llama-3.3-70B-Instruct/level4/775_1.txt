This paper describes a method for differentiating between figurative adjective noun combinations by creating a matrix that captures the relationship between words based on their usage frequency (PMI score). The authors then use strategies to simplify this matrix and generate numerical representations for each noun and adjective which are used as characteristics in training a model to categorize the combinations, as either direct or metaphorical phrases. The effectiveness of this method is similar to that of research that has developed vector representations, for descriptive words. 
When discussing supervision and zero shot learning in their research paper s the writers argue that their method needs supervision and can perform zero shot learning effectively. Yet this statement can be misleading as their proposed technique is fundamentally a supervised classification exercise.The algorithm is trained using vector representations based on existing data and accurate labels.However it can be assessed with words; it does not derive knowledge from them. Moreover these unfamiliar terms are not completely new because the model still needs an existing vector representation, for them. 
The analysis of the findings is interesting well. While the authors present a summary of past research on metaphors the reasoning behind their method is somewhat ambiguous especially the utilization of geometric characteristics like vector length, for metaphor detection. The incorporation of normalized vectors doesn't seem to improve accuracy. Additionally its noted that the noun vector is the influential feature, which according to the authors is linked to how the data was gathered. There are worries about whether this method's appropriate and applicable in various situations – both theoretically and practically speaking – where its impact regarding how metaphors are understood remains unclear and its comparison, to compositional models is questionable. 
The originality of the suggested method is in doubt since the way noun and adjective vectors are represented is quite similar to that of Agres et al.s approach.The main point of emphasis in the paper seems to lie in utilizing characteristics, for vector categorization which might not be groundbreaking enough to differentiate it from previous studies.
