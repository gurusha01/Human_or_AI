This research paper presents a challenge and dataset that involves predicting missing named entities in text by utilizing an external definitional source called FreeBase.The task is difficult because these entities are rare and training models specific to each entity is not feasible.The authors effectively discuss the significance of delving into this scenario.The paper introduces two network models that make use of the external resource along with various baseline comparisons.One of the models aggregates evidence, from contexts within the same text. 
The paper has some strong points, such, as; 
A crafted list of criteria for the project aims to push the boundaries of the field by forecasting hidden named entities in a way that challenges language models.This focus, on entities is expected to spur the creation of advanced models. 
A thoughtful choice of starting points that clearly show the limitations of network models without outside information and uncomplicated cosine similarity based models, with external knowledge. 
The two main models have been selected correctly. 
Your writing is concise. Presents a strong argument. 
Nonetheless, 
The discovery that expanding the contexts beyond the blank containing sentences didn't enhance model performance was a bit surprising. It's curious that even though the HierEnc model leverages knowledge, from contexts and was applied here; the fact that extra context didn't prove advantageous seems counterintuitive. There could be two reasons for this situation. Either the sentences with gaps are consistently more helpful for the task like mentioned in the paper (though it might seem a bit odd) or the technique of using extra context in HierEnc through the temporal network is much more efficient, than simply expanding individual contexts and inputting them into the recurrent network.It might be worth exploring if the latter plays a role in this. 
During our conversation today we talked about how the task and data presented are quite significant and have the potential to make a big impact, in the field overall in my view this is the most important aspect of the paper.
