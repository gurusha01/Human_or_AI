This study suggests using a network method to tackle the challenge of network embedding by combining network structure with text linked to nodes using an attention mechanism that adjusts textual representations according to nearby node text. 
One of the aspects is; 
The suggested model efficiently makes use of both network and text information to create representations using a practical mutual attention technique. Furthermore the assessment is thorough encompassing datasets, reference points and assignments. 
"Areas, for improvement;"
In line with studies in the field of network embedding that draw on neural network methods inspired by word embeddings technology; this paper neglects earlier investigations into statistical and probabilistic network modeling techniques. Furthermore it does not. Draw comparisons to the latent space model presented by Peter Hoff et al in their work, on social network analysis. The study (Association 97 (460); 1090–1098, in 2002) involves placing nodes in a compact latent space before the advent of network based methods. Moreover considering the papers emphasis on representing roles of individuals in social networks it is important that the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel ( MMSB ), by Airold, Ble, Fienberg and Xing ( 2008 ) is mentioned and compared, as it enables nodes to select roles randomly when establishing connections.
Lets talk about a range of topics.
The statistical models mentioned above do not include text or scalable neural network implementations with sampling but are based on reliable generative models instead of heuristic neural network objectives and algorithms. Recent advancements in these models and inference algorithms have enhanced scalability. Now include text processing capabilities. It is uncertain if the performance gap between CENE and CANE shown in Figure 3 is statistically meaningful; this raises queries about the design, like whether random train/test splits were used for repeat experiments. It's important to make clear if the grid searches for hyperparameter values discussed in Section 5​ ​point​ 5​ were done with the test set​ validation set​ or training set as this affects the reliability of the outcomes​.
