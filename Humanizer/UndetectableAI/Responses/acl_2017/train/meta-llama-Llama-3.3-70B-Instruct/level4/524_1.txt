The article highlights a number of advantages such as a holistic method for generating evaluation data and a thoughtfully crafted evaluation plan along with an in depth exploration of different strategies spanning from basic, to advanced methods. 
One area of concern is the depth of analysis provided in the study report aside from the general evaluation findings; this restriction reduces the scope for gaining comprehensive insights, from the research. 
This study compares methods for reliable HPSG parsing and focuses on evaluating existing techniques rather than introducing new ones as its main contribution. To improve the paper further and provide insights for readership the author could delve deeper into the data presented in Tables 1 and 2. Adding sample sentences and illustrations of their analyses where differences, in outcomes occur among the compared approaches would offer context to the discussion.  
Moreover it would be beneficial to include the precision and recall values for EDM in Table 2 well. The EDM F1 score is affected by elements such, as overall and partial coverage parse ranking and search effectiveness. Although the overall coverage data provided in Table 1 is valuable incorporating EDM recall into Table 2 would provide an insight into the scenarios under comparison. 
One thing to clear up is whether 'pacnv. Ut' mentioned in Tables 1 and 2 is the same, as the 'pacnv method discussed in section 2 6 5.
