This article introduces a method for dialogue modeling that builds upon the sequence to sequence generation technique by encoding the dialogue context into a context vector and then decoding it to produce a response; however these models tend to face challenges in generating varied and precise responses especially when trained on extensive datasets encompassing various subjects; To tackle this issue the writers introduce a latent variable called z that creates a probability distribution, over the context enabling both sampling and greedy decoding for response generation. 
The research paper demonstrates a level of technical skill in utilizing deep learning techniques such as conditioned variational autoencoders, for generating responses and incorporating Information Retrieval methods to gather various reference responses.  
Here are some thoughts I'd like to share about the introduction section well as the model architecture and evaluation. Lets break them down below; 
Thoughts on the opening and reasons, behind it; 
The writers seem to lack knowledge, about the history and diverse facets of this field from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. 
The portrayal of the dialogue managers function seems off since it usually entails picking actions within a specific dialogue setting that are then sent to another module for execution. This process is commonly carried out in task oriented systems where the aim's to select actions that are most effective in achieving a goal, with minimal steps. 
The writers struggle to differentiate between task based conversations focused on goals and chatbots or social bots, with unique needs that frequently utilize various data driven techniques. 
The idea of having an "domain" chat can be misleading because conversations are always tied to a particular context and purpose; coherence also depends heavily upon the activity and context, at hand. Humans might not be able to truly engage in open domain discussions. 
Thoughts, on the design of the model structure; 
The authors take a method that includes creating a range of scenarios to choose from and then selecting one at random to come up with answers in a way that is quick and decisive using the coding system. However this way of working might not make sense and goes against what we know from studies on language and how the mind processes language which indicates that individuals typically address any issues in understanding or agreement on a small scale first to make sure everyone is on the same page, before moving forward with the discussion. 
Thoughts, about the assessment; 
The writers seek to show that their model can produce responses that're both clear and varied in nature. However the evaluation technique seems to focus on clarity than variety. This is because the precision and recall measurements assess the gap, between the statements and the generated ones and not among the generated replies themselves. 
Additionally the rise in BLEAU scores is small. Its not clear how often the responses produced show variety and substance. A valuable comparison with other studies, like Li et al. which employ distinct approaches to enhance diversity would have bolstered the paper further.
