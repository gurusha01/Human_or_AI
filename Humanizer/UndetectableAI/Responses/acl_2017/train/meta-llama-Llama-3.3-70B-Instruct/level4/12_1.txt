This document outlines a method based on rules for identifying time related terms by noting that these terms are usually brief and include least one time element within them. The process consists of steps; first identifying time elements using a mix of checking dictionaries and patterns, with regular expressions and part of speech tagging data. Once identified the time element is extended outward using predefined rules until a limit is reached. In the end these time intervals are combined into one time statement using a set of guidelines. Testing this approach against rule based and machine learning systems using three datasets shows marked improvements, in performance. 

The document is nicely organized and clearly explained; it presents rules that are backed by evidence and supported by the results of the assessment. 
Shortcomings; 
The document has some areas that make it hard to replicate the findings as outlined below. 
Lets talk about this in general.
In Section 4 of the document there is mention of "five seasons ". It seems a bit unclear to me as a reader. 
In Section 5 I noticed a mistake. It mentions "two datasets " but it should actually refer to "three datasets."
An example that shows clearly in Section 5 would help to explain things. 
Considering that time related terms are present in 93 percent of the statements and the system has attained a recall rate of 92 percent. Indicating its approaching its capability. The authors ought to provide more details about their plan, for enhancing the system further. 
Is there any indication of whether the detailed rules or the software employed in this research will be made accessible, to the public?
