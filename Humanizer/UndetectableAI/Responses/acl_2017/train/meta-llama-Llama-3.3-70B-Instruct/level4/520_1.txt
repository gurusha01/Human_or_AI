This article describes a method, for forming datasets that include images made up of components and their related logical structures and language explanations with the purpose of establishing a system where the intricacy of images and their descriptions can be intentionally regulated and defined. 
Nevertheless a major downside of this method is its inability to handle complexity effectively not reaching the levels of complexity often seen in image caption generation and other tasks involving multiple modes of information. 
The simplicity of the proposed approach stands out compared to the nature of reasoning tasks in the bAb I tasks range. From simple to complex challenges.The method focuses on increasing the level of difficulty in a basic image recognition task through the addition of extra objects or noise, in somewhat artificial ways. 
The constraint is also noticeable, in the section when poor performance outcomes often appear to be linked to fundamental problems of overfitting or underfitting which could possibly be resolved by modifying the networks capacity or incorporating additional data but without providing deeper qualitative perspectives. 
The opening suggests that the aim is not to achieve performance but to evaluate if structures can exhibit the desired comprehension level.There appears to be an inconsistency in this assertion because the objective is to gauge an architectures comprehension while the score, for performance is not meant to be viewed too seriously. 
Regarding observations; 
It would be more helpful to introduce the approach earlier in the paper. Perhaps, in the introduction instead of waiting until section 3. So that readers can grasp the methodology right from the start.
