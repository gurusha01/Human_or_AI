Lets talk about this in general. 
The authors expand upon the method of labeling roles that Zhou and Xu introduced at ACL 2015 by using deep Bi directional LSTMs and integrating recent improvements for significant performance enhancements in a quantitative manner.Their detailed qualitative analysis of the results adds substance to the research work discussed in the paper.The clarity and structure of the paper are praiseworthy as it includes an examination of relevant literature along, with a comparative study of various SRL models used with similar datasets. 
The study shared is captivating and convincing as it adds value to the field by showcasing the effectiveness of neural networks while also delving into the benefits and constraints of a comprehensive learning approach.
