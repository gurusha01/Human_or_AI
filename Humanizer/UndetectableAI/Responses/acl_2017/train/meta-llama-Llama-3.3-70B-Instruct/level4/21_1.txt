The paper is nicely. Supports its arguments effectively. Especially commendable is the part discussing Previous Researchâ€” it offers an examination and skillfully places the upcoming study in context, within the larger domain. 
Two main issues were brought up about the methodology; (3). The text refers to phrases in section 3. The discussion focuses onlyon word representations.How are phrase representations actually acquired by the authors? (4). Even though Mplus and Mminus aren't directly related in the model they are connected indirectly through the tanhscore function.It would be helpful to knowhow the learned matrices differ from each other (for example is Mminus similar, to minus Mplus?). Moreover what are the possible pros and cons of creating a link, between the two entities through implementing a degree of dissimilarity? 
Adding statistical significance tests to confirm the improvements we've seen would be an idea. 
Here are a few minor typographical recommendations.
Please provide the input you would like me to paraphrase in order to generate a like response.
A different suggestion is offered; than using "entities are translated to " you could use "entities are mapped to." This change helps avoid confusion, with a vector space translation process that the original wording might imply. 
Sorry I cannot provide the rewritten text without explaining my process. If you have any requests feel free to ask!
Line 636 needs to have some of the commas removed from the citation. 
The phrase "The case" probably means "The most likely scenario." 
The citation needs to be fixed as it contains a period and comma.
