The research paper introduces a method for multitask learning in sequence labeling by incorporating language modeling as a goal to enhance performance in various tasks such, as detecting grammatical errors and identifying named entities and parts of speech using a bidirectional neural network structure that predicts output labels and neighboring words in sentences. 
"Advantages;"
The article makes an easily understandable contribution, with detailed explanations of the model and experiments provided.The advantages of including a goal are clearly illustrated to highlight the potential of this method. 

One major drawback of the paper is that it does not thoroughly discuss the array of existing research related to the topics it covers.The comparison tables (Tables 1, to 3) focus on the systems introduced in the paper and do not cite other studies extensively.For a contribution that highlights originality and progress it is essential to present these enhancements by showcasing both new and relevant scores and potentially replicating results. Considering the datasets and past findings available to the public, from previous systems makes it quite noticeable when a comprehensive comparison is omitted. 
Achieving " state of the art results for error detection in FCE and CoNLL 14 datasets " as claimed requires stronger evidence given the presence of studies like Rei and Yannakoudakis (2016). The statement implying that the baseline results match the previous outcomes, in each benchmark might falsely imply that the baseline system includes all past works when this is not the case. 
Lets talk about topics.
The discussion on POS tagging appears to be superficial. The comparison with the study by Plank et al.(2016) might not fully consider the wider range of languages they covered and how their research relates to performance, across different language groups.The paper fails to explore how the suggested system would operate in multilingual or resource constrained environments â€“ this leaves many important queries unanswered. 
The idea of incorporating language modeling as a task is fascinating and the structure and early parts of the paper are praiseworthy.. There seems to be a gap between these elements and the experimental sections indicating a requirement, for more advancement. 
In order to improve the paper further suggests that the authors offer an unbiased discussion of previous research findings while also contemplating replication and acknowledging the systems ability to support multiple languages effectively. Considering the stage of development in this field demonstrated by the abundance of data and operational systems available the paper should aim to mirror this level of maturity. If these enhancements are integrated successfully the current evaluation is, on the brink of acceptability.
