Advantages; 
This document utilizes ignored argument details to improve the effectiveness of event detection by introducing a clear and organized framework design. By integrating an attention mechanism – a method commonly used in tasks such as machine translation – it achieves notable enhancements, over the standard model performance to showcase the systems effectiveness. 
Limitations; 
The method of calculating the attention vector might need an advanced technique than just adding two separate attention vectors together, from each component part at present time. In terms of the supervised attention system suggested strategies could be improved by exploring intricate options that might lead to enhanced outcomes. 
Lets talk about topics; 
Though there are areas that could be improved upon in the suggested framework and the experimental resultsre strong and consistent in nature; overall the manuscript makes a significant contribution and stands as a strong contender for acceptance despite some room, for enhancement.
