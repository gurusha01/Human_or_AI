Pros; 
This research paper introduces a complete neural framework for analyzing semantic graphs with the help of a carefully constructed transition system.The study is interesting as it delves into how to create models for DMRS while effectively dealing with challenges like underspecification of scope.Notably this study brings in a method to computational semantics by utilizing an incremental approach, through transition based structures that enable parsing at a reduced expense. 
Areas, for improvement; 
One main issue is that the initial introduction to DMRS and EP seems a bit generic and the given example isn't very clear in highlighting the features of DMRS effectively. It would be helpful to have a detailed explanation despite being limited by space constraints. Likewise the explanation of the parsing models transition system could be more thorough. Without familiarity, with MRS and EP it can be difficult to fully grasp the significance of the paper besides acknowledging its potential usefulness. 
Lets talk about some topics.
This paper is quite interesting overall.The use of DMRS, in parsing is especially fascinating and the document has been well received.It is anticipated that making the codes and datasets open source will help boost interest and engagement in this research area.
