Following the response, to the rebuttal make sure to provide an update.
The authors have done a job in responding to my questions and explaining their improvements on the baseline model in more detail in preparation for the final version of their work. It is fascinating to consider using elements for languages such as Chinese and Japanese; I am excited to see how this approach can be applied to solve more complex problems, in upcoming studies. 

The idea of interpreting Chinese and Korean characters shows great promise and creativity. 
Areas of improvement; 
The results from the experiment show slight enhancements compared to the standard setup and the way the evaluation is done makes it hard to prove the main argument that visual aspects boost performance, in handling uncommon or unfamiliar words. 
The absence of details, in the initial setup makes it challenging to understand the outcomes and replicate the findings accurately. 
Lets talk about a topic.
This study suggests using computer vision methods to improve language processing for characters in Japanese and Korean by applying CNN techniques to text images containing compositional characters types commonly found in these languages. The researchers test their model on a task that involves classifying text and assigning Wikipedia page titles to specific categories. They found that a basic one hot character representation performs better than the CNN based approach initially used. Enough though combining visual representations, with standard one hot encodings produced superior results compared to using either method individually. They also offer proof indicating that visual characteristics are more effective than one encodings, for uncommon words and show qualitative outcomes suggesting that the CNN grasps significant semantic character representations. 
The concept of interpreting languages such as Chinese and Japanese is fascinating to me; however I have doubts regarding the credibility of the experimental findings presented. The assessments seem lacking in strength, which hinders their reliability. I believe that thorough evaluations are necessary to enhance the papers suitability for publication. While I am open, to accepting the paper if the results demonstrate significance as mentioned in the authors response I would prefer to see a different evaluation method utilized for a more comprehensive understanding.
Can you provide details, on your comments?
In Section 3 of the report the paragraph discussing the "lookup model " does not clearly state which embeddings were utilized and whether they underwent tuning through backpropagation similar to the visual embeddings. It is essential to provide details on how the baseline was implemented. If the baseline was not specifically adjusted for the task contrasted with the embeddings there may be doubts, about comparing their performance effectively.
The decision to assess the model based on categorizing Wikipedia page titles is not very clear because the main reason for utilizing the model lies in its capacity to adapt to uncommon or unfamiliar characters efficiently. A straightforward evaluation method like translating words that are not in the vocabulary using machine translation could be more impactful, in showcasing the limitations of the traditional method and illustrating the importance of visual elements. 
The significance of the improvements shown in Table 5 needs to be verified. 
Figure 4 seems a bit complex to grasp and could be explained in a manner to highlight the models impact better from my perspective; it seems like the x axis reflects the rarity ranking of words (potentially based on log frequency) with the least common words, on the left side.The visual depiction indicates that the model excels in ranking words as it intersects with the x axis to the left of the lookup model. It's not clear why the two models don't meet at the spot, along the x axis even though they were tested using the same titles and trained with identical data.The author response would benefit from an explanation of what message the figure is trying to convey. 
The fallback fusion method should undergo a comprehensive assessment by demonstrating its performance across various thresholds instead of solely focusing on the threshold of 0 as it may not accurately reflect the overall effectiveness of the technique. 
The basic test involving characters seems like a good concept but comes across as an added consideration rather than a primary focus point of the studys results and implications would be enhanced by further scrutiny, in this area to include the classification of unfamiliar terms. 
Please include translations, for Figure 6 to help readers who may not understand Chinese.
