Advantages; 
This document introduces a technique for keeping track of conversation states by using pre trained embeddings to represent slot values and merging them to create distributed representations of user responses and conversation context effectively. The results from testing on two sets of data show significant enhancements compared to the standard method that uses delexicalization. Additionally dthe authors have investigated pre trained word embedding methods, like XAVIER,D GloVe,D and Program SL999. 
Areas, for improvement; 
One of the reasons for using embeddings is to improve adaptability in intricate conversation topics where delexicalization might be constrained.However the datasets utilized in this research seem to have limitations.It would be intriguing to explore how the suggested method functions with or without a slot labeling element in complex dialogues.For example in determining the resemblance, between statements and slot value pairs the estimation could be confined to the extent of the slot values enabling its usage when the values do not align. 
Furthermore the instances shared in the beginning appear to be deceptive since the conversation context should likely mention "restaurant_name = The House." This leads to inquiries, about how coreference resolution affects this particular task. 
Lets talk about a topic. 
In general the idea of using existing word meanings is quite promising and the particular method outlined in this paper is quite remarkable. The approach taken by the writers demonstrates promise and the possibilities it presents are intriguing established as a valuable addition, to the world of monitoring dialogue states.
