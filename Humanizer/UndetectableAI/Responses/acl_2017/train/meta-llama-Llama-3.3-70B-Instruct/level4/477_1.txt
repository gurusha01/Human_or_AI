Could you please provide context or details, about the review you're referring to?
Strengths; 
The paper does a job of explaining why its research question is important. 
ii) It provides an examination of different models, in a wide array of languages. 
Challenges; 
The conclusion made may be influenced by the choice of languages considered which could introduce bias into the analysis. 
The range of experiments doesn't completely cover all the assertions, in the paper. 
Lets chat about topics.
This research paper raises a question about how words are represented and which components of a word are best for capturing morphological information and how these components should be combined together effectively. To investigate this question further the paper examines ways of representing words using various components (like characters,characters trigrams and morphemes) as well, as different methods of combining them (such as LSTM,CNN and basic addition) within the framework of a language modeling exercise. The goal is to find the mix of elements by testing in over 10 different languages that vary in structure and how they affect word formation and function results. The results indicate that using characters at a level is quite effective but has some constraints compared to models that incorporate clear morphological understanding. Moreover character trigrams are shown to produce consistent perplexity outcomes, across languages analyzed. 
There are still a number of unresolved matters to consider. 
The choice of languages could potentially introduce bias as there are ten languages selected from four different categories (with up to three languages, per category). It is uncertain whether these languages accurately represent their categories or demonstrate similar patterns in word representation and composition function within the same category. For example the paper mentions variations in outcomes between two languages, with structure (agglutinative) indicating that it may be more suitable to concentrate on the specific languages studied rather than making general conclusions. 
The claims. The experimental design seem to be at odds with each other, in this case. It's not entirely certain if using language modeling is the way to confirm the papers assertions. Moreover these claims might not apply to tasks so more clarification is needed. 
The assessment in Section 5.l only focuses on Arabic language analysis for some reason. It's strange that they didn't test it out on languages, like Turkish which already have automated morphological analyzers available. 
The paper only focuses on character trios out of groups of character groups without explaining why this specific choice was made clear enough.Clarification is needed on whether character trios perform better, than character pairs or character quartets in language modeling since the efficiency of these groups relies on the size of the corpus and various other factors. 
I noticed a small errors in your writing.
