Pros; 
The authors enhance the task introduction by using examples and providing a clear outline of the papers contributions.  
The section on Related Works gives a look at the latest advancements in the field effortlessly pointing out the commonalities and distinctions, between the methods already in place and the new strategy being proposed. 
The way its explained is very easy to follow. There's a distinction, between the tagging system and the overall model setup that helps make it easier to grasp. 
One notable aspect of this study is its reliance, on established standards to assess methods of triplet extraction and provide a solid evaluation framework. 
In conclusionâ€‹...it's really helpful to have sample data included to show both the pros and cons of the techniques as it helps clarify how tagging and evaluating triplets work. 
Areas of improvement; 
The unique tagging system presented in Section 3 is an aspect of this paper but it coexists with traditional schemes like IO and BIO, for NER and RE tasks. 
The authors use of tagging methods, in their experiments remains ambiguous. 
In terms of the dataset discussed in line 14 on page 5 that mentions 24 relations there is a lack of information, about the quantity and categories of named entities. 
The assessment standards, for triplets outlined in Section 4 of the document seem to draw from research; however focusing solely on the entitys head during the identification stage feels like an oversight. 
In addition the accuracy of the LSTM LSTM Bias output, in the S4 example seems uncertain as the text suggests an inaccurate relationship role though its unclear if the relationship role affects the assessment. 
Lets chat about topics. 
This research paper introduces a tagging system and delves into comprehensive models, for extracting entities and relationships simultaneously in order to advance the field. 
The structure and clear writing, in the article make it easy to understand and grasp the proposed method clearly.
