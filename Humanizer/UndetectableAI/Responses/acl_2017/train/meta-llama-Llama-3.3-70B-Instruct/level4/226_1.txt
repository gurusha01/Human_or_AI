The article highlights a few advantages.
Introducing a automatic framework to create a dataset, for evaluating compositional semantic similarity involves human input in the initial phase followed by automated expansion and then human refinement. 
The effective implementation of this framework in establishing a Polish compositional semantic similarity assessment dataset has resulted in an asset, for the advancement of upcoming Polish compositional semantic models. 
There are also some noticeable drawbacks. 
The constraints of the framework become evident when it is tested with one language in mind; this raises doubts about its adaptability and relevance to other languages since it heavily depends upon a dependency parser that may not be accessible or efficient, across all languages. 
The assessment of the automated expansion system is limited by the absence of information regarding the quantity of sentence pairs modified by judges and the notable percentage (exceeding 3%) of post edited pairs necessitating additional revisions raises doubts, about the precision and effectiveness of the framework. 
The papers many grammar mistakes on lines 210 212, 213 and 428 highlight the importance of proofreading to maintain clarity and professionalism, in the presentation. 
These aspects require thought and fine tuning to enhance the significance and influence of the paper.
