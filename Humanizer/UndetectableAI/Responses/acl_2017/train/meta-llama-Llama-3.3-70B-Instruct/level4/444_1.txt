This study suggests a range of criteria for evaluating the quality of created song lyrics that consider originality and stylistic similarity, to an artist while also focusing on fluency and coherence aspects in the writing style presented in the paper. 
The writers present a mix of marked measurements such as fluency and coherence along with an automated measurement for assessing similarity in their work.. While the concept of the similarity measurement is fresh and interesting in theory its practical value as an evaluation tool is questioned since it shows connections, with other metrics that are recommended to be utilized individually by the writers.. The assertion that this measurement can offer perspectives on system efficiency is not backed up by the paper and does not align with any manually marked performance measurements available. The proposed metric performing scores compared to a baseline system doesn't automatically prove its effectiveness in measuring quality; it could simply be due, to the strength of the baseline system. 
The paper stands out for not mentioning studies that could be relevant to the topic at hand. For instance automated coherence evaluation using mutual information density as seen in Li et al.s work from 2015 is missing in the references list. Furthermore there seems to be a gap where references to style matching research from the natural language generation community should be. Works by Dethlefs et al., published in 2014. Pennebakers investigations, into style matching are notably missing as well.
