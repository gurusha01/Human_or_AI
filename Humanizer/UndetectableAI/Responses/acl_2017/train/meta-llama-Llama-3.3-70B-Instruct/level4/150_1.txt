The writers suggest a modification to the encoder decoder neural machine translation (MT). This method focuses on characters at the start and end. Incorporates representations of morphemes and characters in, between.  
One notable aspect of this project is the sharing of both the code and the completed models for French to translations as well as Czech to English and English, to Czech translations.This allows for verification and reproduction of the findings.  
The system shows good translation quality starting from the training phase and keeps getting better in later phases as well. Moreover,**it seems to** understand how to break down words into parts and can handle new words **effectively** including made up ones,** by going back, to their basic components implicitly**. 
However a number of faults have been identified in the papers approach and presentation. It doesn't clearly outline which WMT test and development sets were utilized to present the findings. This lack of detail makes it difficult for readers to draw comparisons with research. The essential details are found exclusively in the readme file of the code supplement. It indicates that newstest2015 was used as the test set and newstest2013, as the development set.  
The instructions in the software README are sufficient. Could benefit from including specific examples, for training and testing commands.The software also misses out on responding to a  help flag request which's a notable oversight.  
The document outlines a structure, with six levels; however Figure 2 appears to show layers which could lead to confusion. The description accompanying the figure should provide information and in case all layers are not represented in the figure another illustration could be added, perhaps in an appendix to display the full architecture. 
The outcomes are contrasted with those of character based neural systems but do not encompass cutting edge outcomes for other forms of machine translation systems, like the ones reported by WMT and matrix.statmt.org for these datasets and should be recognized and deliberated upon. 
We should address problems like hesitations in English writing spelling errors and formatting glitches in LaTeX such, as incorrect quotation marks. 
The paper makes a contribution to the current body of work on character based neural machine translation by introducing a new method and providing helpful resources for researchers, in the field.
