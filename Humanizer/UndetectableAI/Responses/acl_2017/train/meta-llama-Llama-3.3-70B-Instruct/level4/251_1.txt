The research delves deeply into the characteristics of the skip ngram model and explores how it excels in solving analogy tasks compared with additive composition models while also drawing a link, between skip ngram and Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction techniques. 
The papers exploration of the characteristics of skip gram was impressive. I found the reading to be quite motivating overall The authors did a job in understanding the models underlying assumptions and how they affect composition processes This paper definitely provides valuable insights, for the community
My main concern is that the paper shows a lack of understanding when it comes to language nuances. The way the authors define 'compositionality' viewing it as a process of transforming a group of words into another set with meanings is quite unusual. In truth combining two words can result in a vector that's different from both but still carries meaning without aligning with any other concept, in the space."Compositionality in linguistics involves putting linguistic elements to create more complex structures without needing extra rules besides clear meanings of words combined. The study wrongly suggests that composition happens regardless of word order; however it's essential since changing the sequence can alter the meaning (for instance 'sugar cane' is different, from 'cane sugar'). This limitation is widely recognized in language composition." 
In considering human language usage patterns and choices in contexts,"male royalty" might be preferred over "king" or "prince" under certain circumstances due to pragmatic considerations altering word distributions within a body of text.The discrepancy observed in line 258 (or the KL divergence modification) is attributed to linguistic dynamics rather, than random data fluctuations. While the part about SDR might cover this issue in some way. I'm not completely sure, about it (referencing my notes below).
I believe that the way the authors discuss composition, in the paper has some issues; however...
The conversation about Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction seems a bit disjointed from the discussion.The explanation was a bit hard for me to grasp. I would like some clarification from the authors.I believe the point being made is that skip gram generates a model in which a words surrounding words adhere to a parameterization of a categorical distribution.However it's not clear whether this mirrors the distribution of the dataset or is just a feature of the model (, like a model based solely on counts).Is it reasonable to argue that skip grams effectiveness without directly mirroring the data indicates a kind of sparse distributed representation (SDR) that operates independently of assumptions, about the datas inherent structure? Furthermore could one claim that the resulting embeddings are tailored for tasks emphasizing patterns rather than following the actual data distribution? In terms is there an element of noise reduction involved in this process? 
A few quick thoughts; 
The summary is longer, than usual. Can be shortened. 
I believe it might be misleading to view circularity in this context.Firth noted that the impact of co existence was linked to similarity assessments. Which represent the processes we strive to replicate through statistical approaches.Co existence effects and word representations, in vector space can be seen as equivalent; they both simulate a linguistic process that is not directly observable. Pairwise similarity aims to enhance than disrupt circular patterns and aligns more closely, with the decision making processes commonly observed in humans. 
I believe that 'paraphrase" would be a choice, than 'synonym' considering we are examining a group of words associated with a distinct lexical element. 
"It's quite intriguing how a large chunk of the zipfan distribution. The long tail. Shows a consistent pattern."
It's important to mention that the analogy relationship doesn't always work effectively in real life situations and often involves disregarding the neighbor returned from the analogy computation, which typically represents one of the terms already observed.
It doesn't make sense to me to say that 'man’ could be considered the same as or similar, to anything related to 'woman.' The process of comparing them isn't a combining of elements; instead it includes an implied contradiction. 
A note to add at last. It's common practice to use p(w | c ) to show a words probability in a context situation but in this paper' w' stands for context and' c' stands for target word, which can make reading a bit more difficult ; maybe think about switching it up. 
I appreciate literature.
The argument that Aroras study, in 2016 is the research effort dedicated to exploring vector combination may be somewhat exaggerated.There are studies worth considering as well; for instance Paperno and Baronis work sheds light on why addition is a successful method of composition using PMi weighted vectors. 
In a study by D.Paperno and M.Baroni in 2016 they explored the impact of composition on PMIs in semantic vectors revealing that sometimes the whole is not greater, than the sum of its parts as expected in Computational Linguistics Journal, Volume 42 Issue 3 Pages 345–350. 
I'm ready to assist you with that. Just provide me with the text you'd like me to paraphrase for you.
The response, from the authors is greatly. I am excited to witness the acceptance of this paper.
