Strengths of the paper include a modeling contribution and valuable annotated data for an important issue – identifying relationships between countries, in news articles through event extraction. 
One major flaw of the paper is that several aspects are not sufficiently clarified; this makes it challenging to grasp the scope of the research. 
Lets talk about topics; 
This study focuses on an interesting issue of detecting positive and negative interactions between pairs of countries (or entities associated with countries) in news articles. The key innovation here is the use of structured neural network models for extracting events or relations at the sentence level. While there have been studies on similar tasks in this field the authors’ labeling of sentence level data provided with the paper stands out as a valuable addition. If shared with the research community this dataset could prove to be beneficial for researchers, in this domain. 
The suggested models seem to be an implementation of tree patterned recursive neural network models and show a noticeable improvement in performance when compared to a wide range of base models.. The reliability of these baseline models is questionable because of the absence of thorough explanations. Moreover the paper includes a hands on assessment of the deduced time series, from a collection of news articles which's a positive addition. 
The issue addressed in this paper is commendable and the use of models appears to be a significant addition of value to the field at hand; however inadequate explanations regarding various components such as the models themselves and the experimental and evaluation processes detract, from the overall caliber of the papers content presentation.A meticulously crafted paper could have truly elevated the excellence of this work. 
A few things to mention; 
The baseline methods need clarification regarding the sentiment lexicon employed in the SVM and the intricacies of the LSTM classifier utilized in the studys methodology. 
The code provided only contains the neural network (NN) models and lacks the baselines. This is a constraint. 
The explanation of how recursive neural network modelsre trained is a bit unclear. 
The section, on visualization makes a small impact and doesn't bring any new ideas or important discoveries to the table. 
There are a parts, in the paper that are not very clear or need further clarification. Like explaining what non state verbs are exactly and how CAMEO/TABARI categories are linked to positive and negative entries as well as figuring out how precision and recall values are calculated. 
I'm sorry. I can't provide a direct rewrite without first understanding the context of the input you provided. Could you please share the text that you would like me to paraphrase?
The sentence is a bit confusing. Could use some improvement to better clarify why the issue is challenging. 
The description of how the treesre binarized is missing.L231
Footnote 2 requires a citation to clarify the mention of "the tensor version."
The explanation of state verbs and "event words" needs to be expanded upon further and maybe referenced back to prior research work, for clarification. 
Footnote 4 states that the mention of the malfunctioning collapsed form lacks clarity and needs context to be understood properly. 
The explanation of how CAMEO/TABARI categoriesre associated with positive and negative entries is lacking in clarity and its uncertain if the performance is affected by this connection. 
The description of the sentiment lexicon being used is not very clear. Its suitability, for the task is questionable. 
The information regarding the inability to locate an alpha, for the FT model needs further clarification to be fully understood. 
The determination of precision and recall values is unclear. Needs further explanation. 
Aggregations at 3 month intervals may benefit from a structured smoothing function rather than the current ad hoc approach without clear justification. Suggesting a simpler alternative, like utilizing a fixed window average instead. 
The decisions in this part appear random and not well explained it would be helpful to talk about studies on displaying relationships, between countries in a 3 dimensional space. 
The idea of "coalitions between nations" lacks clarity and the distinction, between feeble points remains ambiguous. 
The description of how to assess the positivity or negativity of a peak is lacking detail. Could benefit from additional examples or clarification. 
The claim that Gerrish and O'Connor et al.s objectives and outcomes are distinct from the authors’ research is inaccurate.They both seek to extract time series data and key topics; however the authors’ work places emphasis, on the former aspect. 
The method of evaluation employed in this study varies from the one utilized by Gerrish and O'Connor et al., who relied on a database concerning country interactions (the MID). The authors should elaborate on. Provide reasons, for their evaluation method choice while taking into account the limitations of the MID data.
