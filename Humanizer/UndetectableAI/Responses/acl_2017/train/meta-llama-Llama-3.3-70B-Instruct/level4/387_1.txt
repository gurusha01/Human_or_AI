Areas, for improvement; 
After reading the summary I expected that the new method would outperform ones significantly by using a mix of eye movement and text features consistently for the best outcomes.. The results, in the paper are more detailed than expected. To make sure people know what to expect from this research I recommend updating the summary and introduction to show these results. 
When assessing how well the model performed on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis it's not clear if sarcastic remarks were taken into consideration during the evaluation process. Did the model show better accuracy, in categorizing non sarcastic remarks compared to sarcastic ones ?
The usefulness of using eye movement data to detect sarcasm makes sense; however its advantages for sentiment classification based not on text features are not as clear especially, in non sarcastic scenarios. 
Lets talk about; 
This paper contains a lot of information and introduces a methodology that seems reliable and creative, in approach. While the outcomes didn't meet my expectations from the abstract preview initially presented to me I do think they bring value to the wider research community and deserve to be shared through publication.
