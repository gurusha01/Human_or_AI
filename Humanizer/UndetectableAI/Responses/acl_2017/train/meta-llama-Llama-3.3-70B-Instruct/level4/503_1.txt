This paper is quite a read. It brings some interesting technical ideas to the table like the parsing algorithm but falls short in terms of being coherent and unified overall in my view.. The authors aim to tie everything under a broad framework that sees a languages probabilistic aspect as a formal characteristic similar to closure, under intersection.. However I feel that the concept of formal languages they present isn't thoroughly fleshed out enough which weakens the persuasiveness of their argument. 
The technical findings highlighted are mostly disconnected from the storytelling flaws in the papers content. Suggesting that the research is sound but needs a presentation, for enhancement of its argument and comprehension. 
It's interesting how the paper doesn't really talk much about the parsing results and puts things like soundness and completeness in the supplementary notes instead.The title saying something about languages is kind of misleading because there isn't really any actual probabilistic reasoning, in the submission. 
Furthermore I think that the importance of the closure of the intersection discussed in section 3 may be exaggerated. Unless there are limitations placed on the conditions of rules that I am not familiar with this outcome seems to be a direct result of including a finite intersection, within the grouping of non terminal labels. Additional explanation would be required to grasp its significance.
