This article introduces a method, for developing conversational agents that participate in mutual collaborative endeavors involving strategic communication to accomplish a common goal.  
This paper is really interesting to me especially because it delves into using data driven methods for managing conversations dialogue flow dynamics caught my attention However after looking into it further I noticed that the approach suggested might not be specifically designed for collaborative tasks that are symmetrical Instead it seems to be more suited, for tasks that involve graph based operations like figuring out where two parties knowledge overlaps 
In Section 2 of the document introduces a collaborative dialogue scenario that is interesting because it draws on previous studies by Clark and Wilkes Gibbs (published in '86 in Cognition ) and Walkers furniture layout task (from the Journal of Artificial Research, in 2000).
The authors mention in line 229 that their field is too intricate for slot value semantics; however since their domain operates on attribute value pairs it might be able to employ a representation centered around attribute value pairs, like first order logic. 
Section 3 point 3 seems a bit tricky to grasp as it often mentions Figure 3 on occasions where the information isn't entirely clear cut. For instance, in Section 3 point 4 it's not so obvious which part of the conversation the example aims to depict or if it still matters following the question "Did anyone visit Columbia?"
