Advantages; 
The article effectively applies principles to distributional semantics and shows significant enhancements, in both intrinsic and extrinsic assessments. 
One area, for improvement; 
It appears that the project is a continuation of previous retrofitting studies with the potential to enhance comparisons by incorporating more benchmarks, like character embeddings. 
Lets talk about topics.
This study introduces the concept of "morph fitting," a method for adjusting vector spaces to include limitations effectively. By implementing "attract' and "repel' constraints in the process to bring variations together and separate derivational antonyms further apart. The researchers showcase the algorithms success in vector spaces and languages by consistently enhancing intrinsic evaluations like SimLex 999 and SimVerb. 3500. Additionally they provide evidence of progress, in the practical application of dialogue state tracking when compared to word embeddings that do not consider morphology. 
The paper is nicely written and easy to understand; it serves as an illustration of how linguistic expertise can be seamlessly integrated into distributional semantic models The practical findings are persuasive; although there are a few inquiries and remarks put forward they don't diminish the overall quality of the paper. 
Notes, for Writers; 
Utilizing the morph simlex evaluation dataset appears redundant since it could introduce bias by being created with the algorithm under evaluation. The outcomes, from datasets are persuasive enough; hence excluding this dataset might prevent any possible misunderstandings. 
I like that they included the morph fix baseline in their work and it would be helpful to compare it to a character embeddings baseline since thats a common way to deal with morphological differences. 
Ideally the vector space that is generated should not bring similar word forms closer together in meaning but also be able to assign specific meanings to different variations of words. It would be helpful to show that the structure of this space is meaningful by proving if the connection between words like "looking" and "look" is similar to that of "walking" and "walk." An examination showing that adjusting for morphology results in a significant space rather, than just better embeddings would be a valuable inclusion.
