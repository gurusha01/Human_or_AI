This study introduces a method for zero resource translation by using parallel corpora from source to pivot and pivot to target languages.The approach includes developing a teacher model based on predicting target language given language data and then training a student model to predict target language given source language data while aligning with teachers guidance, from source to pivot corpus. When comparing to methods, like pivoting variants and other zero resource strategies utilizing word level relative entropy from the teacher samples shows enhanced performance. 
The input provides insights with a new perspective and well defined reasoning supported by strong real world data analysis findings that set it apart from previous research endeavors due, to its broad utility without relying heavily on predefined NMT system assumptions. 
To improve our research further we can conduct a few experiments. First we could test how well our approach works with source and pivot languages that are quite different. This could help us better understand how likely it is for a target language to be predicted based off a source or pivot language. Second we've seen results with word based diversity so it might be worth looking into experiments involving sentence n best or sentence sampling methods even though they might require more computational resources. Also investigating how students transitions, from word based diversity to sentence based diversity as they progress could reveal some findings. 
Some particular notes are also included in the text analysis report provided to you. Of "Despite its simplicity" consider using "Because of its simplicity." For better clarity in context discussion; revise "target sentence y" with "target word y". Lastly, for the assessment regarding the determination of current context selection method. It is crucial to ascertain if probabilities are being compared greedily or with a beam approach when evaluating the likelihood of the probable words and the five most likely words. 
In Section 4 of our research report discusses how comparing with a distribution might not provide useful insights and suggests exploring how helpful p(y | z ) is as p(y | x ) improves instead by studying it alongside models trained on different data amounts or iterations for different perspectives on sentence level scores using mode approximation, versus n best approaches. 
It's quite unexpected that the word "beam" underperforms compared to "greedy" on line 555 since "beam" should ideally align closely with "sampling." It would be useful to have some clarification, on why this inconsistency exists in the results presented there. Moreover Regarding the advantages attributed to "sent beam" mentioned on line 582. It's possible that these benefits might be influenced by fluctuations or noise because of the notable variability observed in the plotted curves.
