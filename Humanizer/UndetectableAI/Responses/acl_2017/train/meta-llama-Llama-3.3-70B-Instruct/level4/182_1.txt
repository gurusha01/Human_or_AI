Hello writers and creators 
Thank you for taking the time to respond to the feedback and clarify points raised in the reviews; its greatly appreciated! Your decision to share your code with the public is truly admirable. Will be incredibly valuable for fellow researchers, in the field. 
After reviewing everything carefully and considering all factors at play I've decided to adjust my overall rating to a 4, out of 5. 
The papers advantages are as follows; 
"The document is nicely. Simple to understand."
The experiments carried out are thorough. Encompass a broad array of situations. 
The findings are. Show that the method is working well. 
Certain shortcomings were observed; 
The project lacks innovations and mostly utilizes technologies that are already established in the field. 
You said you would share the code, for this project but its not out yet; having it would have made the paper better. 
The outcomes are satisfactory. Fall in line, with our expectations without any major surprises. 
During the conversation on this topic it might be helpful to delve into the reasons why traditional audio features such, as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC's)e were not used. 
When it comes to specifics; 
In instances such as L155L15515 "an LSTM," the correction, to "an LSTM " is needed for proper grammar. 
I think adding hyphens after text, in L160 and L216 could be avoided for clarity. 
The way convolution is explained in Section 205 could be enhanced to make it easier to grasp. 
Table 1 is mentioned at the beginning of page 2. Should be positioned there for easier reference. 
Its being questioned on line 263 whether using 3 convolutional neural networks (3DCNN) is the conventional method, in video processing and if there are any other options worth exploring and considering. 
In lines 375 and 378 of the document I noticed that the caret (^) which should be, above the letter "Y " appears to be positioned and may need to be adjusted. 
"In Section 380 it might be clearer to use the term 'to prevent overfitting' instead of 'to check overfitting'."
In order to improve readability, for L403 and L408 sections of text consider using quotation marks or italics to indicate names. 
Like how L155 was corrected from " a SVM ", to " an SVM " L420 should also be adjusted in the same manner.
In line 448 of the document there seems to be an inconsistency, with the number usage. It should either be "Outputs," or the verb needs to be changed to "is."
There is a space, after "layer," which should be deleted in line 489. 
In lines 516 and 519 the word "concatenate" shouldnâ€™t start a line. 
It's strange that we don't know the number of people mentioned in line 567. 
"After reviewing line 626 it appears that the comma following 'Since' is not needed and should be deleted."
"The abbreviation for 'does not', in line 651 should be written out as 'does not'."
In line 777 of the documents content suggested placing "on the hand." This adjustment could enhance the coherence of the sentence flow. 
The references section needs some tidying up. L823 has spaces; L831 should mention the complete location name instead of just "Munich"; the reference to "ACL (1)" in L860 is unclear; there's an unnecessary closing parenthesis in L888; "Volume," without extra formatting should be used in L894; there are extra new lines in L951; and the indentation of " Linguistics ", in L956 is not correct.
