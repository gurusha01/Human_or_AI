The article showcases positive aspects such as its clear writing overall despite a few mentioned areas for enhancement, in the following sections.The issue being tackled is relevant. The suggested multigraph based approach based on MH shows strong empirical results. 
Nevertheless several shortcomings were pinpointed.  
Section 3 could use a detailed exploration of the constraints of the earlier MH model and why the new approach was created in response, to those limitations. 
The need for separators in Section 4 seems unclear as its not fully explained how they offer information, than what T/I/O already provides. 
Section 5 doesn't really provide any insights, on why the new model is better. 
Section 5 paragraph two is too theoretical; it would help to have examples of incorrect structures to see how the new model is better, than MH. 
Overall the paper presents an approach to identifying overlapping entities in text demonstrating progress compared to the existing MH model in experiments, on various benchmark datasets. However it lacks an explanation of the reasons behind and the methods used for the new models improved performance.
