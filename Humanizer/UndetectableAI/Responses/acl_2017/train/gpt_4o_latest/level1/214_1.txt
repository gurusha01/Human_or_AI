Contributions  
The paper discusses analyzing discourse structure by introducing a combined micro representation framework, for discourse analysis.The authors highlight the significance of the secondary relationship that has not received enough attention in previous studies and incorporate it into a hierarchical discourse framework.The main contributions of the paper that stand out to me are outlined below; 
The paper presents a framework called the Macro Micro Unified Representation Schema that merges detailed rhetorical structures with broader pragmatic functions to analyze discourse at both local and global levels with a more encompassing approach, towards understanding discourse structure as a whole. 
The authors have labeled 97 Chinese news wire articles according to their suggested structure to develop the Macro Chinese Discourse Treebank ( MCDTB). This resource helps connect micro and macro discourse analysis in a way and serves as a valuable asset in the field of Chinese discourse analysis due to the scarcity of resources available, for this purpose. 
In the tests conducted in the study mentioned in the document review the suggested framework and dataset by performing tasks like recognizing discourse relationships and primary secondary connections between elements.The outcomes of these tests show that the framework and dataset are effective as they achieve results even when faced with issues such, as imbalanced data distribution. 
Advantages  

The development of the MCDTB is an input since annotated datasets play a key role, in progressing discourse analysis field.  The thorough process of annotation and quality checks bolster the reliability of this resource. 
The emphasis on relationships between secondary elements carries important implications for various NLP tasks like summarizing information and answering questions or analyzing sentiments effectively in real life conversations due, to the schemas hierarchical format matching natural communication patterns. 
Insights from the tests offer valuable understanding of the difficulties in identifying discourse connections like uneven data distribution and similarity in meaning, between relations â€“ these discoveries can shape upcoming research endeavors. 
Areas of improvement  
The MCDTB is a tool but with only 97 articles in its database; the research findings may have limited applicability due, to the small corpus size. 
The paper should include a comparison, with discourse parsers or schemas to better evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested approach and enhance the overall evaluation process. 
In the experiments conducted by the researchers there is an imbalance in the data sets regarding primary secondary relation recognition specifically; although they employ resampling to address this issue additional methods such, as data augmentation or more advanced modeling strategies could potentially enhance the results. 
The content can be hard to understand at times due to its complexity and lack of clarity in explaining the schema and annotation process. Consider making the information easier to grasp by simplifying the storytelling and including visual aids, for better comprehension. 
Questions, for Writers  
How does the suggested framework stack up against established methods, like RST or PDTB in terms of effectiveness and practicality?   
What particular difficulties arose while annotating the data and how were conflicting opinions addressed?   
Do you intend to expand the MCDTB to cover types of content or languages, in the future and if yes is that the case how do you envision adjusting the framework to fit those specific situations?   
Is it possible to use the framework for discourse structures that're not hierarchical, like conversational data? 
In summary   
This paper adds insights to the field of discourse analysis by suggesting a comprehensive framework that covers both broad and detailed perspectives and introducing the MCDTB methodology toolset to support it effectively.This work shows potential; however improving aspects like the scale of data set used and evaluation process would further strengthen its influence.I suggest accepting with adjustments, for improvement.
