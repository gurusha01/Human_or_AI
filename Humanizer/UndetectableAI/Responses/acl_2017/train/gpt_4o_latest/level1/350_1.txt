Reflection, on the Document 
  
This study discusses the issue of event extraction (EE) in natural language processing (NLP) focusing on the constraints posed by scale manually annotated datasets that hinder scalability and inclusivity. The authors suggest a new approach to automatically annotate training data, for EE by leveraging both knowledge (Freebase database ) and linguistic expertise (FrameNet). In my view the main highlights of the paper are outlined below; 
Introducing an approach in the paper for automatically creating extensive labeled data, for entity extraction (EE) by utilizing Freebase to identify key arguments and FrameNet to filter and expand trigger words is a valuable addition that tackles the challenge of scalability faced by supervised EE techniques. 
   
The authors suggest a technique called Soft Distant Supervision (SDN), for labeling data that relies upon the assumption that sentences containing arguments and related trigger words are indicative of events being expressed within them This approach helps address the issue of noisy data commonly associated with distant supervision methodologies. 
The authors show that their data labeled rivals human labeled datasets after assessing them manually and automatically as well as sharing the labeled dataset for future studiesâ€”a valuable asset, for the research community. 
Areas of expertise  
Scalability is a feature of the suggested approach as it minimizes the need for costly human annotations and allows for extensive event extraction, in various fields. 
   
The study conducts assessments utilizing both manual and automated methods to verify the accuracy of the automatically assigned labels, in the dataset provided in the paper demonstrating its high precision and its ability to enhance existing human generated datasets effectively. 
The fusion of Freebase and FrameNet is an approach that showcases the possibilities of merging organized knowledge databases with language references, for Electrical Engineering. 
The choice of a CNN based model utilizing instance learning (DMCNN MIL) as the baseline for the automatically labeled dataset is well reasoned and sets a strong groundwork, for future investigations. 
Public Dataset Contribution; Releasing the labeled dataset is an addition, to the research community as it promotes reproducibility and encourages further exploration. 
Areas of improvement  
When using FrameNet to filter and broaden triggers proves effective. Relies heavily on predetermined lexical units may restrict its flexibility in accommodating new or evolving event categories; including a discussion, on this limitation would enhance the papers credibility and depth. 
The tests concentrate specifically o n 21 event categories from Freebase with encouraging outcomes; however its potential to handle an array of event types is still uncertain. 
The paper does not thoroughly examine the types of noise found in the labeled data and how they affect subsequent tasks despite utilizing SDS and multi instance learning techniques. 
The paper doesn't discuss how its method stacks up against weakly supervised or unsupervised EE methods to give a better understanding of its pros and cons in comparison, to them. 
Queries, for Writers  
How does the technique deal, with event categories or details that are not adequately documented in Freebase or FrameNet?   
Can the suggested method be applied to tasks involving extracting events, in languages?   
What are the expenses involved in labeling data and how do they stack up against the manual annotation workloads? 
In summary the end result is as follows.  
In terms this paper introduces a fresh and significant method for tackling the data bottleneck in event extraction which integrates global and linguistic knowledge while also releasing a comprehensive dataset that adds value to the field of study. Nonetheless improving aspects, like trigger detection, scalability and noise analysis would enhance its effectiveness further. I suggest accepting it with some modifications.
