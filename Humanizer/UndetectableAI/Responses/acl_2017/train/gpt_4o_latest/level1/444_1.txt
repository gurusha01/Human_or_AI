Summary of the research article.
This study explores the difficulty of assessing tasks related to creating language by specifically examining the ghostwriting of rap lyrics.The researchers suggest an evaluation method that merges manual and automated techniques to gauge the smoothness of flow and coherence in the created verses while also considering their stylistic resemblance.They also present a dataset containing rap lyrics from 13 artists that have been annotated for their stylistic similarities.This dataset serves as a standard for studies, in this field. The approach is used to assess a model based on LSTM technology and sheds light on its capabilities and drawbacks, in capturing the distinct artistic style of each creator while also preserving originality. 
Key Contributions
The paper presents a new and thorough assessment approach for evaluating text generation by blending manual assessment (looking at fluency and coherence and assessing style consistency ) with automated measurements (like rhyme density and uniqueness of text). This stands out as a contribution as it establishes a strong basis, for evaluating tasks related to creative language use. 
The writers. Add notes to a collection of rap lyrics by 13 artists while also including annotations on stylist related similarities in the dataset This collection is a significant asset for upcoming studies, in generating creative text. 
Enhanced Automation Enhancement; The article improves upon the automatic assessment approach suggested by Potash et al (2015). It introduces an entropy driven weighting system to manage text effectively and allows for comprehensive automated analysis, on a large scale. 
Advantages
A thorough Assessment Framework is put forward in this approach that considers various aspects of the ghostwriting process such as fluency and coherence, alongside style compatibility that previous studies tend to ignore The integration of both automated measures guarantees a comprehensive evaluation of the task. 
The accessible collection of rap lyrics with annotations is a valuable asset that sets a standard for upcoming studies and aids, in reproducibility efforts. 
The assessment outcomes provide understandings into the strengths and weaknesses of the LSTM model by highlighting its proficiency in capturing an artists typical style while facing challenges, in maintaining coherence with extensive training data sets. 
The authors claim that their assessment approach could be expanded to cover creative tasks beyond just style transfer, in visual art which broadens its relevance. 
Areas of improvement
The paper mainly discusses assessment without bringing forth any advancements in generative modeling.The LSTM model employed is quite standard, with no fresh generation methods suggested. 
The assessment process involves some subjectivity as the agreement among evaluators on coherence is somewhat low, at 43% which may impact the findings dependability. 
During preprocessing we use heuristics to clean up the data but there might still be parts like dialogue or chorus lines that are not, in verse form, which could disrupt the training and evaluation phases with unwanted noise. 
The authors highlight the importance of automation. Note that manual evaluation tasks like assessing fluency and coherence can be time consuming and challenging to scale when dealing with extensive datasets or advanced models. 
Questions, for Writers 
How do you intend to handle the scalability of assessment, for bigger datasets or more intricate models?" Would it be possible to incorporate crowdsourcing or active learning techniques into the process? 
Is it possible to apply the suggested evaluation approach to forms of creative text creation, like poetry or narratives as well? If yes what adjustments would be needed? 
How does the effectiveness of the LSTM model stack up against generative models, like transformers or diffusion based methods when applied to the identical dataset?

In general this document offers an addition to the assessment of creative language generation assignments. Although the main emphasis is assessing than producing the knowledge and tools offered are expected to leave a lasting impression, within the industry. Boosting the scope of assessment and delving into more sophisticated generative models could enhance the work even more.
