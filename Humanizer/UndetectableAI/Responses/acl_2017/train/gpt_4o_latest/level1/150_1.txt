Impact
This research introduces an advanced neural machine translation framework at the character level called DCNMT to overcome the challenges faced by traditional word based NMT systems such as issues with extensive vocabularies and training inefficiencies.The new model integrates a word encoder that grasps morphology through two neural networks (RNN) along with a hierarchical decoder that functions, at the character level.The structure comprises six RNN units distributed across four layers for training and effective results. The researchers show that the model performs better in terms of BLEU scores compared to byte pair encoding (BPE) based models after one epoch and is on par with the latest character based models for tasks like translating between English French (En Fr) English Czech (En Cs) and Czech English(Cs En). Moreover the model demonstrates its ability to grasp morphology effectively and deal with spelled or nonce words giving it an edge, over word level models. 
The key aspects highlighted in the paper include; 
A new design for character level Neural Machine Translation (NMT); The incorporation of a decoder and a word encoder that is aware of morphology marks a notable progression in character level modeling, for NMT purposes sidestepping the challenge of dealing with extensive vocabularies and facilitating effective training processes. 
The model excels in understanding morphemes. How they combine together which enhances its capacity, for broader generalization and quicker training speed. 

Areas of expertise
The thought out hierarchical decoder and morphology aware word encoder in innovative architecture tackle important issues, in character level NMT by effectively managing lengthy sequences and acquiring significant representations. 
This model is quite efficient even though it uses six RNN units; it manages to achieve BLEUscores with less training time compared to similar character level models. 
The research showcases evidence that the model grasps morphology well through PCA visualizations and the capability to manage intricate or unfamiliar morphological forms. 
The capacity to convert spelled and newly coined words is an exceptional and beneficial attribute to have; especially when dealing with chaotic or content produced by users. 
The thorough evaluation includes experiments across language pairs and offers detailed comparisons, with both word level and character level benchmarks. 
Areas of opportunity
The model is quite competitive but doesn't always surpass the notch character based models in terms of BLEUs scores consistently; authors need to explain the balance, between efficiency and ultimate performance better. 
Scalability Issues; The suggested design is effective for analyzing characters. Could encounter scalability issues with lengthier sequences or extensive datasets as, per the reports omission of investigating deeper RNN models or prolonged training periods. 
The paper focuses mainly on presenting results; however including qualitative examples of translations such, as the handling of rare or morphologically complex words would enhance the credibility of the claims regarding morphology learning. 
The authors briefly touch upon the possibility of applying the technology to tasks, like speech recognition and text summarization but fail to present any evidence or elaboration to back up this assertion. 
Queries, for Writers
How does the models effectiveness improve with training periods or more complex RNN structures potentially leading to better performance compared to state of the art character based models in terms of BLEUs scores?"
Can you share real life examples or specific instances to demonstrate how the model deals with uncommon words that are misspelled or have complex forms? 
Have you looked into how changing hyperparameter settings like the size of embeddings and the number of layers affects how well and efficiently the model works? 
Feel free to share any thoughts or feedback.
In terms the article offers a strong and creative method for character level NMT that is well justified and innovative, in nature I believe that by acknowledging its shortcomings and offering more qualitative perspectives it could greatly enhance the overall quality of the paper.
