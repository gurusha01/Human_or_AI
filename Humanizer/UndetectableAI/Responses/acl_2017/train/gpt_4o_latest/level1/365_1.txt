Summary of the research paper.
This study discusses the issue of standardizing texts which is made difficult due to the lack of available training materials for this task The authors suggest various encoder decoder structures and introduce a multi task learning (MTL) method that utilizes letter to sound correspondences as additional information The effectiveness of these models is tested using 44 sets of Early New High German texts and shows a 2% increase compared to the best existing methods, in this fieldThe paper also includes a discussion, on how multi task learning develops attention focus without relying on explicit attention mechanisms.The authors have shared their implementation with the public to support reproducibility and future studies. 
Key Findings
A unique use of Encoder Decoder Frameworks is shown in the paper where encoder decoder models are utilized for text normalization, for the first time ever and their efficiency is proven over conventional benchmarks. 
Using data for multi task learning enhances performance notably when employing phoneme to grapheme mappings as an auxiliary task in scenarios, with limited resources. 
The paper delves into the analysis of Multi task Learning (MTL) and Attention Mechanisms. Reveals that MTL can learn attention like behavior implicitly. 
Advantages
The new models perform well compared to other standards, by a considerable margin; the most effective design even boosts word accuracy by close to 3% showcasing the real world benefits of this method. 
A thorough assessment is conducted for the models using 44 datasets to guarantee their reliability and applicability across various scenarios.The incorporation of baseline comparisons enhances the credibility of the findings. 
Utilizing MTL in a way by incorporating phonetic representations as a supplementary task proves to be innovative and successful, in overcoming the obstacle of scarce training data availability. 
Insightful Examination; The paper delves deeper than looking at performance metrics by examining the acquired representations and the relationship between MTL and attention mechanisms adding complexity to the study and laying the groundwork, for future investigations. 
The authors enhance transparency. Encourage further exploration of their methods by sharing their implementation publicly for reproducibility purposes. 
Vulnerabilities
Limited Contextual Analysis;" The models focus on words and may overlook the broader context of the tokens involved which could lead to better handling of ambiguous cases." The authors recognize this constraint. Do not delve into possible remedies such, as harnessing contextual embeddings or language models. 
The paper suggests that while Multi Task Learning (MTL) can lessen the reliance, on attention mechanisms to some extent as claimed in the studys findings; it fails to delve into situations where attention and MTL could work together synergistically enhancing each others effectiveness with exploration offering a deeper insight into their collaborative dynamics. 
Dataset Specific Fine Tuning of Hyperparameters; Adjusting hyperparameters based upon one manuscript could lead to bias in the results presented by the authors as they suggest this approach mirrors real world constraints for scenarios with limited resources; however a thorough and systematic examination of hyperparameter sensitivity would provide stronger support, for their assertions. 
Queries to Writers
Could you explain further why using attention mechanisms with MTL can lead to reduced performance and if there are instances where attention can still be beneficial, in scenarios? 
Have you thought about using context at the token level (such as embeddings at the sentence level)? If yes would you anticipate any difficulties, in dealing with uncertainties during normalization? 
How do your models perform differently in dialectal regions, within the dataset and are there particular dialectal areas where the models face challenges? 
Additional Thoughts 
The article is nicely. Presents a compelling argument in favor of utilizing encoder decoder architectures and MTL in historical text standardization efforts. It would be beneficial to address the noted shortcomings to amplify the effectiveness of this research endeavor. In terms of usefulness and significance, within the field of study is noteworthy.
