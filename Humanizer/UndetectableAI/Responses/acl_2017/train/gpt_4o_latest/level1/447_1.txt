**. Impact** 
This study explores how the arrangement of discourse elements using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) can benefit text classification tasks. The researchers introduce a neural network model that integrates discourse dependency trees generated from an automatic parser. A unique attention mechanism is presented to assign varying importance to sections of the text according to their discourse connections. The study assesses the effectiveness of the model across five datasets covering a range of text classification tasks and shows that leveraging discourse structure can enhance performance in many instances. 
The main achievements of this project are; 
The paper shows how incorporating the structure of discourse into models can improve text categorization by emphasizing important parts of the text through discourse dependency trees. 
A new attention mechanism is introduced that draws inspiration from RST and differs from normalized attention mechanisms as it prevents sibling nodes in the discourse tree from competing with each other. 
Empirical Testing Across Scenarios; The model undergoes assessment using five different datasets and demonstrates top notch performance in four of them while shedding light on the challenges of discourse parsing in specific genres, like legislative bills. 
Areas of excellence
The paper convincingly argues for the value of incorporating discourse structure into text categorizationâ€”an relatively unexplored avenue, within the field. 
The authors assess their model across datasets such, as sentiment analysis and legislative prediction tasks to enhance the overall applicability of their results. 
The article offers an examination of how the quality of discourse parsing affects the performance of models and includes real life examples to demonstrate the pros and cons of this approach. 
Top notch Outcomes Achieved; The suggested model showcases top notch performance across four out of five datasets. Showcasing the effectiveness of this approach. 
The authors share their implementation openly for others to access easily and encourage reproducibility and additional research opportunities. 
Vulnerabilities
Limited Applicability Across Different Types of Writing; The system does not perform well when analyzing bills due to the distinct discourse norms present in this genre compared to the data it was trained on.. This leads to doubts about how effective the method would be for tasks, outside its scope. 
The complete model underperforms compared to versions like the unlabeled one when dealing with smaller datasets due to potential overparameterization for tasks, with limited training data. 
The models effectiveness heavily relies upon the quality of the discourse parser used with it. This could pose issues in areas lacking access, to top tier discourse parsers. 
The paper does a job of comparing its model to previous neural methods but lacks a thorough comparison, to simpler non neural baselines that could provide context for the improvements seen with the new method. 
Queries, for Writers
How will the suggested model deal, with texts containing inaccurate or unclear discourse analysis results? Would enhancing the parsers output with elements of uncertainty enhance its resilience? 
Could we expand the attention mechanism to include linguistic aspects, like syntax or meaning to improve its effectiveness even more? 
Have you thought about adjusting the conversation analyzer using data that's specific, to the task in order to enhance its ability to adapt to different domains? 
Additional Remarks 
In terms this study provides a valuable insight into the field by showcasing how discourse structure can be beneficial in categorizing text content.Although there are constraints,such as challenges in applying this approach across different genres and the reliance of quality parsers the suggested method paves the way for promising future exploration, in developing NLP models that are aware of discourse nuances.
