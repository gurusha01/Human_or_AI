This research discusses the drawbacks of word embeddings at the type level due to their inability to grasp the meanings and contexts of words effectively by suggesting a new method for generating token embeddings that are sensitive to context and grounded in WordNet data resources.The authors present a technique for depicting word tokens as distributions across WordNet synsets and their hypernyms while using context to calculate embeddings, in real time. The embeddings are used to tackle the task of clarifying prepositional phrase (PP). This leads to an enhancement of 5..3 % accuracy (34.% relative decrease, in error) compared to standard approaches outlined in the papers key contributions; 

   
The authors show how these embeddings are useful by incorporating them into a LSTM model to clarify PP attachment in Onto LSTM PP model that performs better, than other models using retrofitted WordNet embeddings and older top tier systems. 
The paper thoroughly examines the proposed approach by emphasizing its ability to control variations and adapt well to training data, with the support of concrete examples demonstrating the advantages of integrating WordNet resources. 
Merits
The new approach shows an enhancement in accurately attaching PPs compared to standard type level embeddings and previous cutting edge systems This showcases how effectively the method utilizes lexical ontologies, for subsequent tasks. 
The research presents a method for dynamically calculating token embeddings by leveraging WordNet synsets and hypernyms creatively while handling semantic uncertainties effectively and optimizing embeddings for rare or unfamiliar words through parameter sharing, among related terms. 
The authors provide an assessment that includes a thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluation with comparisons, to various baselines and experiments conducted on different sizes of training data setsâ€”a comprehensive analysis that enhances the credibility of the method proposed. 
The suggested framework is versatile. Can be expanded to suit other NLP tasks that gain advantages from lexical ontologies as outlined in the papers future research segment. 
Areas of improvement
Relying much on WordNet restricts the methods usefulness to languages or fields lacking comprehensive lexical resources. Although the authors recognize this constraint to some extent they could have considered approaches for settings, with limited resources. 

The study showcases outcomes regarding prepositional phrase attachment; however the analysis focuses solely upon one specific task area.With a demonstration of their utility, across various natural language processing tasks could enhance the overall applicability of the method. 
The paper talks, about how context sensitivity plays a role but doesn't go into detail about how understandable the attention mechanism's how it picks out relevant synsets in unclear situations. 
Inquiries, for Writers
How does the computational expense of OntOMATIC LSTM Plus Plus stack up against the methods when it comes to training duration and speed of prediction? 
Have you thought about applying the suggested approach to types of word databases like multilingual WordNet or specialized ontologies, in specific fields? 
How does the model deal with situations where WordNet doesn't have information, for certain words or meanings?
