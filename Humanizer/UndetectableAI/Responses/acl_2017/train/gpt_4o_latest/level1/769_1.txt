Summary 
This article introduces a scenario of collaborative conversation where two individuals with unique information need to work together to find a common item through an open discussion format. The writers present a set of 11 thousand dialogues between humans gathered through crowd participation that showcases diverse linguistic and strategic elements. To tackle the complexities of this scenario effectively the writers suggest DynoNet, a model that adapts knowledge graph representations in real time as the conversation unfolds. The model blends organized information, with dialogue history to produce responses that fit the context appropriately. The research paper assesses Dynonet through manual assessments to showcase its effectiveness compared to standard neural and rule based models, in achieving objectives successfully with fluency and human like qualities. 

One major achievement is the development of a dataset consisting of 11 thousand dialogues, for symmetric collaborative conversations. The dataset encompasses a range of language variations and strategic elements that advance the capabilities of current dialogue systems. 
The new approach called Dynonet combines knowledge from knowledge graphs, with informal conversation history to represent open ended dialogue situations in a unique way that involves continually updating graph embeddings as a crucial innovation. 
The paper presents an assessment framework that covers interactions between bots and bots as well as between bots and humans.It also includes evaluations, from partners and third parties to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of the model. 
Advantages
A new dataset has been created that serves as an asset for researchers in exploring the practical and tactical elements of conversation.This datasets broad scope and varied content make it a noteworthy addition, to the field. 
Innovative Model Design; Dynonets dynamic knowledge graph embeddings are a way to connect task focused dialogue systems with open ended chat systems effectively as shown convincingly in the ablation studies highlighting the significance of the models design decisions. 

Strategic Observations; The examination of tactics (such as giving importance to characteristics with limited distinct values) and the models capacity to emulate these strategies is a significant contribution, towards comprehending conversational patterns. 
Areas, for improvement
The dataset and model seem to work in the collaborative setting they were designed for but its uncertain how effective they would be in different dialogue scenarios, like negotiations or group conversations. 

The discussion regarding the intricacies of updating knowledge graph embeddings in Dynonet lacks depth, particularly in terms of scalability to accommodate larger knowledge bases or more intricate tasks, which could raise concerns. 
Asking Writers 
How well does Dynonet work in situations with larger knowledge bases or more complicated attribute structures and are there any limitations, in terms of scalability? 
Is it possible to expand the dataset and model to accommodate party conversations or situations where collaboration is not equal, on both sides? 
How does the system manage contradictory statements and is there a way to address such conflicts, in real time? 
General Evaluation 
This research paper significantly enhances the dialogue systems field by presenting a dataset and an original model along with a thorough evaluation framework despite potential issues regarding adaptability and scalability; it forms a robust basis, for upcoming collaborative dialogue studies and merits approval.
