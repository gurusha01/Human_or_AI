This study focuses on the job of answering questions in a wide range of topics using only Wikipedia as the main source of information. The new system called DrWiki incorporates a two step process; (1.) A Document Finder component that effectively locates Wikipedia posts, through bigram hashing and TF IDF comparison. (2.) A Document Reader component which is a layer recurrent neural network designed to pull out answers from the located articles. The researchers test their system on question answering datasets (such as SQuAD and Curated TREC) showing that learning multiple tasks, with indirect guidance enhances performance across different datasets.They emphasize the difficulties involved in integrating document retrieval and machine comprehension within one system. 
Key Contributions;   
DrWikis evolution as a QA system is detailed in the paper through an innovative method that merges document retrieval and machine comprehension into a seamless process flow specifically centered around Wikipedia content only for enhanced focus and resource efficiency, unlike other systems that depend on various redundant knowledge bases. 
   
The researchers assess DrWikis performance on question answering datasets and highlight its adaptability and reliability through multiple tests.A hybrid training method that merges training with input from additional datasets through distant supervision is proven effective, in enhancing results across a wide range of datasets. 
The paper extensively examines the Document Retriever and Document Reader modules by discussing their advantages and drawbacks in detail. For instance the Document Retriever surpasses the search engine integrated into Wikipedia while the Document Reader attains cutting edge performance levels on the test, for machine understanding. 
Assets;   
The paper addresses an issue by focusing on a realistic and less explored problem in the field of QA that involves utilizing only one knowledge source to avoid the redundancy and complexity seen in multi source systems such, as IBMs DeepQA. 
   
The system shows results based on real world data and performs well across various datasets using a multitask learning strategy that proves the advantages of incorporating a wide range of training data sources. 
The authors thoroughly. Conduct in depth studies on both the Document Retriever and Document Reader by including feature removal analyses and comparing them to basic systems such, as YodaQA. 
Scalability and versatility are features of the system as it is created to be universally applicable and easily adaptable to various document collections, in the realm of QA. 
Areas, for improvement;   
There is a lack of originality in each part of the process since combining retrieval and comprehension is beneficial but the components themselves like TF IDFBased retrieval and LSTM Based comprehension are based on used methods which restricts the innovation, in the approach. 
There is a decrease in performance in open domain question answering when moving from machine comprehension (where a paragraph is provided) to open domain question answering (where all of Wikipedia is available). For instance the accuracy score for matches on SQuAD decreases from 69..5 % to 26..7 % highlighting constraints within the entire process from start, to finish. 
The systems performance might be enhanced by conducting end, to end training than training the Document Retriever and Document Reader separately because it could help optimize the overall QA task more effectively. 
Questions, for Writers;   
Have you thought about integrating end to end training, for both the Document Retriever and Document Reader systems or not ? If not what hurdles would you encounter in doing so ?  
How does the system manage questions that have than one possible answer or are unclear, about the answer sought when several relevant excerpts are found?   
Could there be improvements made to the Document Reader so it can gather information effectively from multiple paragraphs or documents? 
In summary   
This study adds value to the open domain question answering field by introducing an adaptable system that leverages Wikipedia as its primary source of information for answering queries effectively and efficiently. Although the system showcases performance and careful planning there is still potential for enhancements in terms of innovative methodologies and comprehensive optimization from beginning to end. Overall this research lays a groundwork for further exploration and advancements, in this domain.
