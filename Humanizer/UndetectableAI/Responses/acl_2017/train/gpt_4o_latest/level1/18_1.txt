I will provide a review.
Summary 
The research paper presents a neural network design called the Attention over Aattention (AoR) Reader for tasks involving understanding passages with missing words to be filled in (cloze style reading comprehension). The AoR Reader introduces a feature that adds an extra layer of attention, on top of the document level attention to create "attended attention " which helps predict the final answers better. The model is crafted to be more straightforward compared to methods yet delivers better results in terms of performance. Furthermore the article suggests a method for re ranking the top N predictions to improve accuracy using characteristics like worldwide and local N word language models.Results from tests on known datasets such, as CNN/Daily Mail and Childrens Book Test (CBTest) show that this new approach surpasses current leading models significantly. 

The main innovation is the Attention over­Attention Mechanism (AoAM) which calculates attention weights for both the document and the query simultaneously. This dual attention strategy enhances the models capacity to understand the connections between the document and query better; consequently resulting in improvements, in performance. 
Simplicity and Effectiveness; The AoE Reader stands out for its approach and computational efficiency in delivering top notch performance without the need, for intricate structures or heuristic driven consolidation functions. 
The paper introduces a re ranking technique that imitates how humans double check by using linguistic elements (such, as global/local language models and word class models). This process aims to enhance predictions and improve performance. 
Advantages
The latest technological advancements of the AoAo Reader show enhancements compared to current models by achieving an increase of, up to 3​. 
The attention over all mechanism brings a perspective and innovation, to the table tackling the shortcomings of previous models by specifically understanding the significance of individual focus points. 
Examination; The document offers thorough experimental findings that involve dissecting various elements such as comparisons with standard practices and in depth investigations into the length of documents and the frequency of candidates This, in depth analysis bolsters the credibility of the suggested methodology. 
The AoP Reader offers a framework that may be adapted for various tasks needing shared focus, between two sequences as hinted in the conclusion. 
Reordering Methodology; Enhancing predictions through the N best re ranking technique by incorporating elements has shown a distinct and quantifiable enhancement, in performance outcomes. 
Areas, for improvement
There is a lack of innovation in the ranking approach as it heavily depends on traditional methods, like language models and feature weighting without introducing any groundbreaking concepts.Its impact is seen as gradual when compared to the AoM mechanism. 
The AoAs system enhances results. Lacks detailed analysis and visuals to show how the model understands document query connections effectively to prove it comprehends language rather than just acting as a document based language model. 
Evaluation is focused on cloze style datasets raising questions, about the generalizability of AoR Reader to reading comprehension tasks and datasets that demand more intricate reasoning abilities. 
The computational complexity of re ranking poses a challenge as the AoR Reader is generally efficient on its own; however the additional computational load arises during the ranking phase especially when training local language models, for each test document. 
Authors are often asked questions.
Could you show some real life examples or illustrations of how the attention over focus mechanism works to clarify and show how well it captures the connections, between documents and queries? 
How effective is the AoR Reader when tackling datasets that involve sentence reasoning or tasks that go beyond simple cloze style reading comprehension? 
What is the computational expense associated with implementing the N best ranking approach and how does it change when dealing with bigger datasets or lengthier documents? 
Suggestion
The research paper makes an addition to the reading comprehension domain, by introducing a unique AoE approach that leads to top notch outcomes despite some small issues regarding clarity and applicability; the benefits of the suggested method surpass its drawbacks in my opinion and I suggest its approval.
