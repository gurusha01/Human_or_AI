"Paper Summary"
This study explores how using subword based forms can enhance language modeling in a variety of languages with morphological structures. The researchers methodically analyze subword elements like characters and morphemes and different ways to combine them such as addition or using bi LSTMs and CNN models. They test these language representations on ten languages that belong to four distinct morphological types. Fusional languages that blend words together agglutinative languages where prefixes or suffixes are added to the base word, root and pattern languages, with fixed word formations and reduplicative languages where parts of words are repeated for emphasis or grammatical purposes. The research also involves tests with human labeled word structure analyses to evaluate the drawbacks of existing subword models.The findings show that character based models like character trigrams combined with LSTMs perform better than word based representations in many instances but are not as effective, as models that have specific morphological understanding. 
Key Findings
A thorough analysis of subword representations in morphological languages is presented in the paper to compare the effectiveness of different subword units like characters and character trigrams as well as composition functions such as bi LSTMs and CNN structures, across a diverse set of ten languages. 
The authors introduce a blend of character trigrams and bi LSTMs that has not been explored before and shows top notch performance in many languages, with complex word structures. 
Oracle is testing out human analyzed word structures to see how they stack up against subword models in a report that highlights the limitations of current subword models in grasping the intricacies of word structure and underscores the significance of having a clear understanding of word formation rules. 
Advantages
The article carefully assesses subword representations and composition methods, in different languages and linguistic structures to offer valuable perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. 
The research sheds light on the varying effectiveness of subword representations based on typology findings – character trigrams excel in fusional and root and pattern languages while BPE proves less effective, in cases of reduplication. 
Practical Applications for Natural Language Processing (NLP); The results indicate implications for NLP professionals by indicating that character level models can be useful across various applications but might benefit from additional explicit morphological understanding for better outcomes in languages, with complex morphology. 
Extensive. Quality Assessment; By examining the counterparts and specific perplexity outcomes in detail offers a more profound understanding of the advantages and limitations of various models—specifically their challenges in fully representing linguistic aspects such, as repetition of words or phrases. 
Areas, for improvement
The oracle experiments only cover Czech and Russian languages. Don't explore other language types, like agglutinative or root and pattern languages which could provide more conclusive results. 
The study of reduplication is not deeply explored enough in the realm; there is little conversation about why subword models find this type of linguistic structure difficult to process effectively and accurately.The research could benefit significantly from a thorough investigation into the specific hurdles and opportunities related to reduplication (such, as employing specialized segmentation strategies). This would undoubtedly enrich the content of the paper. 
The research mainly looks at language modeling with a set restriction that doesn't fully reflect real world natural language processing needs where dealing with an open vocabulary is essential for success, in diverse tasks. 
The paper looks at ways to combine information but doesn't talk about the trade offs in terms of computational efficiency for each method used in detail like how bi LSTMs are more computationally intensive, than addition and may not be as practical because of this. 
Questions, for Writers.
How can the results be applied to NLP tasks, like machine translation or text classification? 
Is it possible to widen the scope of the oracle trials to include languages or linguistic categories in order to offer a more thorough assessment of the differences, between subword models and morphological analyses? 
What are the trade offs in terms of computing when using bi LSTMs of simpler composition methods, like addition or CNN operations? 
Extra Remarks 
The paper is nicely. Makes valuable additions to our knowledge of subword representations, in NLP field.. Working on the noted drawbacks could boost its effectiveness even more.
