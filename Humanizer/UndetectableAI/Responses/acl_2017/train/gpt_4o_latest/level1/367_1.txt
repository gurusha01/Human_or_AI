This research aims to explore the drawbacks of automated assessment tools used for Natural Language Generation (NLG). It introduces a metric called RAINBOW that merges the advantages of word based metrics (WBMs) and grammar based metrics (GBMs). Through an assessment of 21 metrics using three datasets and systems the study uncovers that the existing metrics do not align well with human evaluations especially when it comes to individual sentences. The researchers pinpoint challenges like discrepancies in scales and variations, in performance based on specific datasets or systems. The RAINDBOW metric suggested in the study shows better correlations with human assessments (up, to ϕ=0.81) surpassing the performance of current metrics (with a maximum correlation of ϕ=0.33). Additionally the research includes an error examination and shares its code and data openly for accessibility. 
The primary achievements of this research are; 
A new measurement called the RAINBOX Metric has been developed to enhance the accuracy of sentence evaluation based on assessments by combining various metrics and using ensemble learning techniques to merge WBMs and GBMs. 
A thorough assessment was conducted comparing 21 metrics on a scale, across various datasets and systems to showcase their strengths and weaknesses and how they vary based on the dataset or system used. 
Analysis of Errors; An in depth examination of the reasons behind the shortcomings of metrics which includes inconsistencies in scale measurements as well, as the impact of dataset traits and the reliability of training data. 
Advantages
The new RAINOBOW metric shows an enhancement in correlation with human assessments and fills a key void in evaluating natural language generation (NLg). Its consistent performance, across datasets and systems is a notable advantage. 
The paper conducts an assessment of current metrics by considering both word based and grammar based methods while shedding light on their constraints. 
Error. Useful Observations; By conducting an analysis of errors in the data processing stage we can pinpoint significant challenges like the limitations of metrics in assessing moderately satisfactory outcomes and the impact of unique dataset characteristics. These discoveries provide guidance and valuable insights, for upcoming studies. 
Ensuring reproducibility is vital, for the research community; authors make their code and data publicly accessible to facilitate replication and expansion of their work. 

Areas, for improvement
RAINDBOW has some limitations in terms of generalization despite its performance because it depends on many features that could hinder its scalability and practicality in scenarios, with limited resources or real time requirements.The Top 4 model offers improved efficiency. Comes at the cost of sacrificing some level of performance. 
RAINDBOWs advancements it still leans on references provided by humans that may lack uniformity and clarity in some instances.The research paper doesn't delve deeply into assessment methods of references which could pave the way for a fruitful avenue to explore. 
Evaluation Scope; The evaluation primarily looks at the correlations at the sentence level which's important but it could have also considered external evaluation measures like assessing the success of tasks, in dialogue systems to offer a more comprehensive understanding of metric performance. 
The intricate nature of RAINDBOW lies in its learning method which enhances effectiveness but also introduces computational complexity when compared to more straightforward metrics such as BLEAU or ROUGE.This could potentially hinder its use, in specific scenarios. 
Queries, for Writers
How well does the RAINBO metric fare in real world tests, like measuring the effectiveness of dialogue systems or gauginng user contentment levels? 
Have you thought about integrating evaluation methods without references, into RAINDBOW. What effect could this have on its performance? 
Is it possible to modify the RAINDBOW metric for assessing situations in time and what compromises would need to be made for this adjustment?
