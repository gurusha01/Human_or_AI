Reflection, on the Document 
Contributions.
This study discusses the difficulty of analyzing dependencies in a type of English based creole that differs significantly in vocabulary and sentence structure from standard English usage. The researchers develop a database of dependency trees containing 1 200 sentences following the Universal Dependencies (UD ) system. They introduce a stacking method to merge English grammar knowledge into a cutting edge parser trained on the Singlish treebank. The resulting parser achieves an UAS ( attachment rate ) of 84.21 % showcasing a 36.51 % decrease, in relative errors. The authors have also made their annotated treebank and parser available to the public along, with the source code for anyone to use freely. 
The key findings outlined in the paper include; 
Singlish Dependency Treebank offers a resource with 1200 annotated sentences following the UD scheme for processing languages with limited resources effectively.The researchers have meticulously covered the grammatical aspects of Singlish like topic emphasis and copula omission as well as discourse particles to establish a strong linguistic base, for upcoming studies."
Utilizing stacking to integrate English syntactic knowledge into the Singlish parser proves to be an innovative and efficient strategy that takes into account the distinct distribution patterns of Singlish and English languages resulting in significant enhancements, in overall performance metrics. 
The authors conduct an assessment of their parser by analyzing errors, in various syntactic categories and generously share their resources with the NLP communityâ€”an invaluable contribution. 
Advantages
Resource Establishment;The inclusion of the dependency treebank is a noteworthy contribution to the domain as it fills a notable void in resources for creole languages.The thorough annotation method employed by the authors and their compliance, with UD guidelines guarantee the integrity of the data provided. 

The research paper thoroughly assesses aspects like experimental outcomes in comparison to standard models and delves into error assessment related to distinct Singlish grammar elements along with an exploration of distributed lexical meanings which sheds light on the obstacles and remedies, for parsing Singlish. 
The authors support the NLP community by making their treebank and parser available for research purposes, through open source contributions. 
Areas, for improvement
The Singlish treebank provides data but its size of 1200 sentences is small compared to larger treebanks, for more common languages which might limit how well the parser can be applied to broader Singlish contexts. 
The paper only looks at dependency parsing. Doesn't test how the parser affects other NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis or information extraction which could show its practical usefulness better. 
The neural stacking method works well; however the paper fails to compare it with transfer learning methods, like multilingual embeddings or zero shot parsing for a thorough evaluation. 
Queries, for Writers
How well does the parser handle sentences that include many words borrowed from non English speaking tongues, like Malay or Tamil ? Are there any intentions to include language related tools for these specific tongues in the future ? 
Is it possible to expand the stacking method to include syntactic information, from other creoles or regional languages? If yes what difficulties could potentially come up? 
Have you thought about testing the parser on tasks, like sentiment analysis or information extraction to show how versatile it is? 
Additional Remarks 
The paper is nicely. Tackles a significant issue within the realm of low resource NLP (Natural Language Processing). The incorporation of expertise with computational techniques and resource development positions it as a promising contender, for approval; nonetheless improving upon the highlighted deficiencies would amplify the overall influence of the study.
