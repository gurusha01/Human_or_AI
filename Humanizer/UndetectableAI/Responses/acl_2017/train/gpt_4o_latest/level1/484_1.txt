This study introduces an integrated approach for automatic speech recognition (ASr) merging connectionist temporal classification (CTC with attention based models to create an end to end system that overcomes challenges seen in conventional hybrid HMM/DNN ASr setups like dependency on linguistic tools and intricate decoding processes, with conditional independence premises. The writers showcase how well the suggested approach performs on two ASRs Japanese and Mandarin Chinese achieving results to cutting edge hybrid systems without needing linguistic tools such, as pronunciation dictionaries or morphological analyzers. 
The key highlights of the paper are; 
The combined CTC and Attention Framework is a feature of this study as it effectively merges the advantages of both approaches by using CTC based alignment for regularization during training and decoding to tackle alignment challenges, in attention based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASV). This integration serves as a contribution of the paper. 
A streamlined ASL pipeline is suggested to remove the requirement, for language support and conventional hybrid ASL elements which greatly simplifies the process of constructing models. 
The approach proves its effectiveness by delivering results on tests, in Japanese and Mandarin languages; indicating its real world usefulness and reliability. 
Areas of expertise
The unique fusion of CTC and attention is groundbreaking and compelling in its approach to tackling alignment inconsistencies and sparse data in end to end ASR, by utilizing the alignment of CTC alongside the adaptive nature of attention mechanisms. 
Streamlining the development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASr); Removing tools like pronunciation dictionaries and language models is a crucial move towards making ASr development more accessible to a wider range of languages, with limited resources. 
Strong Experimental Findings; This approach demonstrates results that're just as good or better than the leading hybrid systems in the CSJournal and MTS tests while utilizing fewer resources. The outcomes have been thoroughly. The breakdown studies (, like the impact of Î» value) offer useful perspectives. 
Decoding Approach; Utilizing a two step decoding method that merges attention driven beam search with CTC based rescoring proves to be efficient and eliminates the necessity for extra rules such, as length penalties or coverage terms. 
Areas, for improvement
The evaluation is limited in scope as it only focuses on Japanese and Mandarin Chinese languages for the experiments conducted by the authors of the study report their rationale for this decision being the shorter letter sequences in these languages; however its applicability to languages with longer sequences, like English has not been explored yet. 
The process is less complex even though it streamlines the ASL pipeline; however training still demands computing power (taking 1 4 weeks on just one GPU for CSF) which may pose a challenge, for scholars lacking adequate hardware access. 
The papers findings are strong; however it doesn't directly compare with advanced lattice free sequence discriminative training techniques like TDNN with MMI that are recognized for their performance, in certain scenarios. 
The paper mentions briefly about alignments in attention based ASRs but fails to offer a thorough error analysis for the suggested approach hindering a clear understanding of its limitations and possible areas, for enhancement. 
Queries, for Writers 
How well does the method work on languages, like English that have sequences in their text structures? Have you thought about utilizing subword units to tackle this challenge? 
Is it possible to lower the training cost without compromising performance by using models or reducing the number of training epochs while still achieving good results? 
How does the combination of CTC and attention methods stack up against lattice free MMI approaches, in terms of effectiveness and computational speed? 
Additional Thoughts 
The paper is nicely. Offers a thorough explanation of the new method being proposed here! The combined CTC and attention framework appears to be quite valuable for the ASK community as it has the potential to make ASK development easier for languages, with resources. Howeverm if the paper were to undergo a comprehensive evaluation and a deeper analysis of its limitations; it would likely be even more robust.
