Review of the document
Contributions
This study introduces a self teaching system for acquiring bilingual word similarities with limited bilingual data available.| The technique continuously improves an embedding match by beginning with a small basic dictionary (as few as 25 word pairs)| or even a numerically generated list.| According to the authors| their strategy delivers outcomes when compared to cutting edge methods that depend heavily on more expansive bilingual resources, like extensive dictionaries or parallel collections of texts.| The key findings of the paper are outlined as follows; 
The key innovation lies in the self teaching structure that leverages resemblances in embedding spaces to enhance mappings and vocabularies, with bilingual data – yielding impressive outcomes. 
The technique shows that notch bilingual embeddings can be acquired with just a 25 word vocabulary or a list of numbersa notable decrease in the need, for bilingual data reliance. 
Extensive tests on bilingual word list creation and cross language word similarity confirm the success of the suggested technique by demonstrating better results, than current methods. 
Areas of expertise
Achieving outcomes with just a 25 word dictionary or a list of numbers represents a notable decrease in resource needs for this methods effectiveness and suitability, for language pairs lacking extensive bilingual dictionaries or parallel corporal data. 
The method suggested is straightforward to put into practice and computationally effective.This is made possible by the authors utilization of an approach, for embedding mapping and vectorized dictionary induction to ensure scalability. 
1) Real world Data; The technique consistently surpasses or equals the latest methods in bilingual lexicon discovery and cross language word similarity assignments—even, with limited resources. 
The paper offers an analysis of the underlying optimization goal addressed by the self learning system enhancing the credibility of the approach and suggesting new directions, for future studies. 
Challenges
The study only assesses the approach across three language pairs (English, to /German/Finnish) and does not include testing on a wider range of linguistically diverse or less resourced language groups that have distinct scripts or notable morphological variations. 
Although the technique works effectively with seed dictionaries and performs inadequately with random initialization as pointed out in the study findings noted that it relies heavily on the quality of the initial seed provided—potentially posing a constraint, in completely unsupervised circumstances. 
There is an absence of comparison with recent unsupervised methods in the papers findings – particularly those involving fully unsupervised bilingual embedding techniques like adversarial approaches.This omission complicates the evaluation of how competitive the proposed method is, within the wider landscape of unsupervised learning. 
Questions, for Writers
How well does the approach work with language pairs that're vastly different in structure like English Chinese or English Arabic and is the assumption of structural similarity valid, in these instances? 
Could the suggested framework be expanded to accommodate linear transformations and if it can be done so smoothly without affecting performance and computational efficiency in a negative way? 
Have you thought about including subtle cues like similar sounding words or shared origins to boost effectiveness in situations where a limited initial word list is not accessible? 
Additional Remarks 
The paper is nicely. Offers a detailed account of the suggested approach and its theoretical foundation.The experiments cover a range within the selected language pairs; however wider assessment across various languages and a comparison with recent unsupervised methods would enhance the studys credibility.In general the paper presents an addition to the domain of bilingual word embeddings specially in situations, with limited resources.
