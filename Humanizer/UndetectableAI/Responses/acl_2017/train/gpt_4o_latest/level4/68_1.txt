Shortcomings exist in the area of ACL mainly due to two reasons; 1) Readability scores are not highly relevant to the goals of computational linguistics but do hold some importance in educational and public communication fields. 2) Another concern is the writing quality, with a minor grammatical errors found in the paper.
