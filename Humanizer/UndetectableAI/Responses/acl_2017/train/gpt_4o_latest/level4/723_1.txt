This study delves into the analysis of word structure using word embeddings presenting a method that utilizes these embeddings to assess the connections between words that may have morphological ties, as well as the overall semantic coherence of various morphological segments types This article is skillfully. Provides a valuable advancement to previous methods, in semantically guided morphological segmentation. 
The researchers perform tests with data, from the Morphological Challenge in three languages. English,Turkish and Finnish. Each showcasing different degrees of morphological intricacy.The models are trained using content obtained from Wikipedia. 
The findings show that the new MORSE system shows enhancements in F1 score for both English and Turkish compared to the commonly used Morfe system acting as the standard reference point.. However it falls short in performance compared to Morfe, for language processing. The researchers propose that this could be attributed to the intricacies of morphology leading to scarce data availability and subsequently affecting the accuracy of word embeddings. The authors could think about using word embeddings that include word information to improve performance in languages, like Finnish and other complex languages.

The writers also raise concerns about the Morpho Challenge datasets and point out problems like words being segmented incorrectly in them they also mention that even though some segmentations in the dataset may be historically accurate (like "business" being segmented as "busi ness") these segmentations are no longer meaningful in terms of meaning. To tackle this issue head, on the authors present a dataset containing 2 000 segmentations of English word forms that are driven by semantic considerations and sourced from English Wikipedia. Their study shows that MORSE outperforms Morforessor by a margin, on this fresh dataset. 
To sum it up nicely and concisely. This paper is really well written. Presents some strong outcomes, in the fascinating realm of semantically guided morphological segmentation work.The addition of the code and a fresh dataset significantly boosts the worth of this submission.
