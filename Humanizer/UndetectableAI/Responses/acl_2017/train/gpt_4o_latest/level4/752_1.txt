Sure thing! Here's the finished rewrite; 
Areas of expertise; 
The research paper shows that seq2seq models can be successfully modified for AMAR parsing and realization tasks by linearizing a customized treated version of the AMAR graph and its accompanying sentence while also utilizing 'Paired Training,' which involves iteratively back translating monolingual data paired with fine tuning techniques). Despite the parsing performance falling short compared to research studies (such, as Pust et al., 2015) those methods made use of extra semantic details. 
In the AMIN realization challenge presented in the study reveals that integrating monolingual data via back translation enhances results when contrasted with a seq to seq model that doesn't make use of such information (See the note below about comparing to previous non seq to seq efforts, for realization).
Areas, for improvement; 
The main issue is that the paper mainly focuses on comparing evidence in situations where various factors and aspects change simultaneously (sometimes due to differences, in available information) which makes it difficult to make straightforward comparisons. 
In one example from the results (Table 2) the PBMT system (Pourdamghani et al., 2016) trained on LDC2014 dataset with 13 051 sentences is compared to the model discussed in this study trained on LDC2015 dataset with 19 572 sentences ( at http;//amr.isi.edu/download.html). This difference highlights an improvement of than 5 points, over the current best system (PBMT) mentioned briefly in Table 2s description and lines 28–29 and lines 120–121 and in Line 595. To make a comparison we need to reassess both the suggested method and PBMT by using the identical training data set. 
Lets talk about topics and ideas.
Is there any connection between the sentences in your Gigaword sample and the test sentences in LDC2015 E86? It is noted that LDC2015 E86 contains information from the " report data in LDCs DEFT Narrative Text Source Data R1 corpus (accessible with an LDC account at https;/ /catalog.ldcupenn.edu/LDC2015 E86)." LDC2013 E19 seems to have data sourced from Gigaword (https;/ /catalog.ldcupenn.edu/LDC2013 E19). Likewise the AMR corpus LDC2014 T12 also incorporates "information, from newswire articles chosen from the English Gigaword Corpus, Fifth Edition," which can be accessed publicly via this link. Https;/ /catalog.ldcupenn.edu/docs/LDC2014 T12 / README.txt. Kindly confirm that the test set is free, from any form of contamination. 
Have the alterations to the encoder had an effect, on performance levels and what drove the decision to make these adjustments? 
Can you please specify in an appendix if the setup relies on a existing seq to seq framework, for reproducibility? Thank you. 
What length was ultimately chosen for the sequence termination point. Should this information be added to an appendix? 
Please provide names for the sections in Table 1 ( development and testing). Also note that there is a difference between the content in Table 1 and the statement in the text stating "Table 1 outlines our progress in stages of self training." It appears that only outcomes, from the stage of self training are presented. 
Is it possible that the numbers in the column of Table 1 should actually read as 71·2 and 63·9 instead of whats shown in the CAM R column as noted in the last row of Table 2 at http;//www.aclweb.org/anthemeology/S16­1181 for the setup involving +verb+rne+srl+wiki'? It appears to be referring to the to last row from Table 7 in CAM R (, by Wang and others. 2016). Also curious how your method deals with incorporating wikification details mentioned in LDC2015F86?'
Section 7 of the document does not include a citation, for the example mentioned. 
This seems like a hypothesis that needs to be tested in practice rather than a firm conclusion as it appears now. 
If theres a page to spare in your writing project or document you might want to think about including a final section to wrap things up nicely. 
How do you go about decoding information do you employ beam search methodology in your processes? 
Concern regarding the size used in the experiments was brought up after discussing lines 161 163 of the document, in question.Was any mention made of the size of the vocabulary used post processing and were there any tokens not previously encountered in the dev/test sets? Moreover during Section 3; in Section 3 utilized the unknown word replacement mechanism using attention weights as described? 
In studying real world applications of the concept discussed earlier in the case study mentioned above at this link;. Examining how well it performs in situations that AMRs typically struggle with. Like handling quantities and verb tenses would be intriguing. 
The paper could be improved with an explanation (maybe a few sentences) discussing why AMRs are chosen over other semantic structures and how using human generated AMRs could have an edge over training a model directly (like seq2seq models for tasks such, as machine translation).
When looking ahead to projects (which were not considered in the evaluations for this assessment because the corresponding paper has not been officially published in the EACL proceedings yet) I'm interested in understanding what leads to the variations when compared to previous seq2seq methods in terms of parsing techniques. Specifically speaking about Peng and Xues work from 2017 and focusing solely on AMRs (as shown in Table 1) could the discrepancy in performance be attributed to differences in architecture design process. How the input is prepared and structured before processing it further or maybe due, to the dataset used for training models or a mix of all these elements combined together? By the way the correct citation for the research by Peng and Xue, in 2017 should be Peng et al., 2017 (http;//eacl2017.org/index.php /program /accepted papers ; https;//arxiv.org/pdf /1702.05053.pdf). The order of authors is mixed up in the References part.
