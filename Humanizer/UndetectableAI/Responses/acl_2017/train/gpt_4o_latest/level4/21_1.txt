The manuscript is nicely. Supported by solid evidence throughout its discussion of the topic, at hand. 
Regarding the methodology discussed in Section 3. 3 I have two inquiries. Firstly it is mentioned in Section 3. 3 That phrases are involved, yet the discussion predominantly revolves around word representations. Can the authors elaborate clarify how phrase representations are actually developed ?  
Is there any connection between M positive and M negative in the model even though they are not directly linked but indirectly through the tanh scoring method used in the model? How do these learned matrices differ from each other. For example does M negative look similar, to a version of M positive multiplied by. 1)? Moreover what benefits or drawbacks would emerge from linking the two matrices by enforcing a dissimilarity restriction? 
Additionally it would improve the paper to analyze the importance of the performance enhancements that were reported. 
I have some ideas for improving the typography.
