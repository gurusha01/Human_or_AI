Advantages; 
The content is crafted skillfully. Structured in a clear manner. 
The platform combines innovative methods like global optimization into a holistic approach, to neural relation extraction; the utilization of parser representation directly is especially fascinating. 
The suggested method delivers top notch outcomes on the ACE05 and CONLL04 datasets, outperforming methods. 
The document contains a variety of evaluations. 
Areas of improvement; 
The approach seems to be building upon existing methods mostly. 
The improvements in performance (an increase of point two percentage points, in the test phase results) though noticeable are not considered significant as no statistical tests were presented in the report. 
Lets talk about topics and ideas.
Main Remarks; 
How did the recent parser and GloVe word embeddings influence the effectiveness of relation extraction, in the model? 
How did the system deal with predictions, during the prediction phase? 
I have some feedback, to share.
The way local optimization is described in the introduction can be a bit misleading as it doesn't solely focus on the "perspective but also takes into account the structural similarities, between incremental choices made along the way. 
In Figures 6 and 7 it would be better to connect the data points with lines instead of curves. 
How are objects depicted in the " segmentation method"?
