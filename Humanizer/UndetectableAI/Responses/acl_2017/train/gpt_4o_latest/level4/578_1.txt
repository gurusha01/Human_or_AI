  
The article discusses a neural model for understanding semantic graphs by using a well planned transition system efficiently. The study is intriguing as it delves into creating representations of DMRS and tackles issues such as scope underspecification effectively. This research introduces a method in computational semantics by employing an end, to end incremental framework based on transitions that allows for parsing with minimal computational resources. 
Weak Points;   
I am mainly worried about the papers section on DMRS and EP being too general, without highlighting unique aspects of DMRS clearly in the example provided I feel that a more thorough explanation is needed However considering the limited space available this is somewhat expected A similar problem arises with the explanation of the transition system utilized in the parsing model Without understanding MRS and EP beforehand,'tis hard to extract insights from the paper except, for acknowledging its general excellence. 
Lets talk about topics.  
Overall I must say I found this paper quite engaging and thought provoking. The way they utilized DMRS for parsing was truly impressive and I genuinely enjoyed delving into the content of the paper. I am eagerly anticipating the publication of open source code and datasets as I believe it has the potential to advance this research field into an area of interest.
