I have rewritten the text in a like manner. Here is the paraphrase;

Zero shot relation extraction presents an complex issue that researchers are tackling head on with the creation of a comprehensive dataset designed for relation extraction within a question and answer framework—a potential game changer, for the academic community. 
Areas, for improvement;   
The paper could benefit from references to previous studies and a clearer recognition of existing research efforts, in the field This could help highlight the originality of the papers contributions better. 
Lets talk about a variety of topics.  
The authors view relation extraction as a task to reading comprehension.They create a dataset of 30 million relations that have been transformed into natural language through mechanical turkers writing queries based on a schema.They modify the reading comprehension model proposed by Seo et al.(2016) enabling it to output a "no relation" response in addition to answering questions.This is different, from the model which always produced an answer. The main goal and result of the paper appear to focus o​n achieving zero shot relation extraction​​​​​​​​​​​—extracting relations that were not seen during training when tested​. 
The paper is nicely written with a concept presented in it! Nevertheless the assessment of the experiments and the contrast, with studies fall short in highlighting the originality and significance of the findings effectively. 
The paper fails to consider an amount of prior research work in the field of relation extraction using neural networks, over knowledge base paths and for unseen entities as discussed by Neelakantan et al (2015) Verga et al (2017) and Bordes et al. However the authors only mention that Bordes et al.s dataset was annotated at the "relation" level than the triple level (relation entity pair). Could Bordes et al.have used an annotation approach here if there is indeed a significant difference it is not clearly explained in the paper also the NAACL 2016 paper (https;//www.aclweb.org//anthology/N/N16/N16 N16 ) presents an innovative model, for relation extraction basedon memory networks There are likely other relevant studies available as wellThe authors should acknowledge and explain the uniqueness of their work compared to studies early on in the introduction due to its striking similarities with them; this lack of clarity was evident right, from the start. 
The authors missed out on assessing their model on a existing dataset or comparing it to established models that have been previously published on similar tasks in their own dataset. This gap undermines the reliability of the experimental results. Given the body of prior research tackling similar challenges and the lack of significant innovation in this approach the authors should conduct experiments that showcase how their method surpasses existing techniques in accomplishing the task or present proof that their dataset has unique benefits compared to others (, for instance its larger size facilitating improved generalization).
