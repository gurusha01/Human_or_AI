This article presents a neural network design that incorporates linguistic rules into a memory network to assist with labeling sequences, in conversational systems language comprehension tasksâ€”primarily focusing on slot filling responsibilities within the system. 

The main significance of this study is its technique of converting organized information into a set of vectors (referred to as memory) which is then incorporated into the tagger as additional knowledge base content. This method shares similarities in terms of concepts with syntax focused attention mechanisms like attention directed towards nodes in treeLSTM. Other relevant studies mentioned are Zhao et al.s work on entailment and Liu et al.s research on natural language inference along with Eriguchi et al.s exploration, on machine translation. The suggested substructure encoder is similar to the DCNN model (Ma et al.) in which each node is represented by a series of preceding words and their connections. Although the design is not completely original, in nature, the straightforwardness and usefulness of this method make it attractive when compared to research efforts. 
"Areas, for improvement"
The actual findings don't seem persuasive because there isn't enough information provided about the baseline results.Below are some comments sorted by importance. 
The suggested model comprises two elements; sentence embedding and substructure embedding as outlined in Table 1.The foundational models (TreeRNN and DCNN) initially crafted for sentence embedding purposes can be modified to produce node/substructure embeddings as well.However the specific methodology employed to calculate these two components remains uncertain. 
The system uses two neural networks (RNN); a chain based RNN and a knowledge guided RNN with a slight difference being the incorporation of a "knowledge" vector from memory into the input of the knowledge guided RNN (as depicted in Equations 5 and 8). It appears unnecessary to have weights, for the two RNN types since the main advantage of this setup is an augmented model capacity resulting in more parameters. Furthermore the specific hyperparameters and dimensions of the neural networks are not provided, which creates challenges in ensuring consistency, in parameter counts among different models. 
It would be an idea to include more information in the RNN baseline model, like word positions and NER findings for the experiments to be more comprehensive. 
The models responsiveness to parser errors is not. Evaluated in the discussion despite its potential impact, on performance. 
Thoughts, about the model; 
After calculating the embeddings for the substructures and considering how to incorporate attention at each word level seems sensible on thought.Why was a fixed attention method selected for every word, in the process in place the "knowledge" seems to act more like a filter to emphasize crucial words.This also backs up including the baseline mentioned earlier that incorporates characteristics directly. 
Doesn't it mean that words will get significance if they match the whole sentence closely in terms of the embedding computations made by the RNN/CNN model? This could indicate that nodes and phrases resembling the entire sentence would carry weight in this scenario. 
The paper suggests that the model can apply to types of information but requires presenting the substructure in a word sequence format for clarity and effectiveness in utilizing constituent parses, as knowledge within this framework. 
Finally labeling the substructure embeddings as "knowledge" might cause confusion as it usually pertains to worldly knowledge like databases of entities; whereas in this scenario it mainly reflects syntax or possibly semantics (, for example; AMT analysis).
Lets have a chat about topics. What's, on your mind?
This paper introduces a model that shows performance with one dataset but lacks innovative concepts (refer to Strengths). For an ACL paper to be impactful it should provide significant insights and conclusions. Moreover the experimental findings presented lack persuasiveness and need clearer explanations to assess the contributions properly. 
After presenting a counterargument the response was made. 
The writers didn't fully tackle my worry about how the baselines like TreeRNN are utilized to calculate substructure embeddings separately from the sentence embedding and the joint taggers use of two distinct RNNs that boosts the parameter count of the suggested model in contrast to the baselines is another important concern, for me; hence I'm not changing my ratings.
