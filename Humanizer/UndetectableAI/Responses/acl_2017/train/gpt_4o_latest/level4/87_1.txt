One of the aspects is the strengths.  
The article is nicely. Straightforward to understand.   
The research questions are tackled effectively with a designed set of experiments that are structured in a clear manner. 
"Areas of improvement;"  
The research shows some lack of originality as it utilizes a standing concept known as the "first sentence heuristic." This study applies a version of this heuristic, to the field of keyword extraction which may not signify a groundbreaking approach despite still holding value in its own right.   
The research paper doesn't include the cutting edge methods or extremely recent advancements in the field. When comparing the system to state of the art techniques the evaluation heavily depends on established baseline models. While the experiment effectively addresses whether the system surpasses these baseline models or not it doesn't conclusively prove its superiority, over the advanced methods available today. This drawback somewhat reduces the significance of the study. 
Lets talk about this in general.  
Overall the paper is well. I suggest it for publication and presentation.   
I recommend that the authors provide a context for their work and discuss how the system performs in comparison, to others.  
The study by Martinez‚ÄêRomero et al. published in the Journal of the Association, for Information Science and Technology in 2016 focuses on the use of a semantic graph based method to extract keyphrases.   
"This piece bears some resemblances to the present research, in specific areas."  
The authors of the paper titled "Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction" are Le Thi Ngoc Le and Minh Nguyen Le in collaboration with Akira Shimazu for the Australasian Joint Conference, on Artificial Intelligence held in 2016 published by Springer International Publishing.
