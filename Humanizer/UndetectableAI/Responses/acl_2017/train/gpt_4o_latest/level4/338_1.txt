Advantages; 
The section discussing research is thorough and provides a solid foundation for the papers argument by contrasting it with the new approach presented in this studys findings.The detailed examination, in the evaluation section enhances the credibility of the experiments conducted. 
Areas, for improvement; 
Section 3 is a bit unclear about the dataset used for training both the SVM and the proposed model.It is also missing details about the datasets size and the timeframe for data collection, beyond the starting date mentioned for testing data gathering.Providing these specifics could help clarify the results and statistics discussed in Section 3.   
The number of reviewers in Table 3 is just slightly less than the number of reviews posted for hotels which implies that a few reviewers submitted more than one review in the dataset with labels provided there. How does this compare to the dataset depicted in Table 2? What's the specific count of reviewers in Table 2. What percentage of them are considered labeled reviewers? It would also be beneficial to determine the number of reviews, per individual. If only a small number of reviewers provide reviews (meaning there's not much to go on) the outcomes could use a deeper conversation. 
Lets talk about topics.
This research paper discusses the issue of detecting reviews in situations where there is little data available, for making decisions from scratch. The authors suggest using a network model that combines text and behavior data to analyze new reviews effectively. In terms the paper is well written and the findings are quite convincing. 
Grammatical errors; 
"The new reviewer only gave us feedback."  
Jindal and Liu (2008 ) took the step. As it is an older work it may be appropriate to describe it in the past tense.   
Please replace contractions, like "cannot " "could not ". What is."  
The new reviewer just posted a review that we need to address promptly. They haven't shared any reviews with us.
