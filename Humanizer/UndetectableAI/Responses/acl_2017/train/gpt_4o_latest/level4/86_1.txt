The article presents a neural model that aims to forecast Python syntax trees based on written explanations using a sequential approach, in a depth first order following Pythons language rules.The notable features of this model involve integrating parent node details into the LSTM input mechanism and utilizing a pointer network for replicating symbols while also applying unary closure to condense chains of unary productions and streamline the tree arrangement.The models effectiveness is evaluated across three datasets from various fields and proves to outperform most previous methods significantly. 
Areas of expertise; 
The paper is nicely crafted; it provides descriptions of the system and a detailed analysis. 
The proposed system builds upon established concepts naturally intertwined with ideas in the field of study. Recent works closely linked to this include tree based generation featuring parent feeding by Dong and Lapata in 2016 and RNN based semantic parsing incorporating copy mechanisms, by Jia and Liang in 2016 well as Ling et al., 2016. Additionally explored is grammar guided parsing as detailed in the work of Chen Liang et al., 2016 (https;//arxiv.org /abs /1611.00020) where a code assist system ensures the validity of the code structure. On the hand the model presented in this paper stands out by producing notably lengthier and more intricate programs compared to the majority of the studies mentioned earlier. 
Areas, for improvement; 
The assessment is based on the precision of the code ( match) as well as the BLEU score; however this might not be the best method for evaluating program accuracy.For instance in Table 5s example differences between the first two lines in boxes A and B are apparent yet their meanings remain unchanged.Discrepancies in names could also exist without impeding functionality.Evaluating correctness through program behavior (such, as employing test cases or static code analysis) would offer robust proof of accuracy. 
One other thing to consider is that basic systems like NMT might generate code that's syntactically incorrect at times. It would be helpful if the authors could showcase the outcomes for the accurate and valid code (such, as using beam search method ) produced by these basic systems. This would ensure an equitable assessment since these systems could opt to reject any flawed results. 
Lets talk about topics.
Some previous methods that used languages also included instructions on grammar usage in their approach. For example Berant and Liang, in 2014 used a grammar for logical forms (refer to Table 1). It would be beneficial to compare this work with theirs and highlight the difference that our papers grammar is more extensive thus enhancing its significance. 
When it comes to how parents feed their offspring in this model. Does it consider which child is being fed at that moment as if its their first or second child being taken care of by them separately and uniquely depending upon that childs index position in SeqToTree by Dong and Lapata (2016)? They mention employing hidden states, for each of these two non terminal cases. 
Are the potential tokens included in the data set and does the model take into account that the range of tokens is predetermined? 
The samples provided in the appendix are nicely laid out. Offer valuable assistance. 
I will rewrite the text for you. Lets start!
After looking over the authorsâ€™ reply I can say that I have gone through it thoroughly and understand its content.
