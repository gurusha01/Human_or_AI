This study introduces a technique based on rules for extracting time references in text documents.The main concept is that time references tend to be brief and contain at one term related to time.The method starts by recognizing time related terms through a mix of searches,recurring patterns and part of speech (POS) labeling.It then extends the detected time segment forwards and backwards from the identified term, with the help of a predefined set of guidelines. At lastl the technique merges the elongated sections into one concise time statement with a set of guidelines.There has been enhancement shown by testing this method against traditional rule based and machine learning (ML)policies, on three separate data collections. 
Strengths include; 
The article is nicely. Has a clear structure. The suggested regulations are based solidly in real world data observations. Seem reasonable according to the evaluation findings. 
Shortcomings; 
Certain parts of the methodology lack clarity and detail which can pose difficulties, in replicating the findings as intended as indicated in the information provided below. 
Lets chat about; 
Section 4 subsection 4 Why do we have five seasons. How do we manage occasions like the month of Ramadan or the holiday season?   
In Section 5 do we need to change "two benchmark datasets' to "three datasets"?  
In Section 5 it would be beneficial to have an example of a time expression, without a time marker.   
In Section 5 of the report it mentions that most time expressions include a time related term and the system has achieved a recall rate of 92%. How do you intend to enhance performance beyond the level when the approach is close, to reaching its maximum potential?   
Will the full set of guidelines or the software being utilized be made available for release, in the future?
