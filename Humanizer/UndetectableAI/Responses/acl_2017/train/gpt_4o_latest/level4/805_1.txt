**Advantages;**
The uniqueness of the CORE assessment metric is notable. Is complemented by the effective accuracy of the suggested similarity metric used in the studys findings. Additionally praiseworthy is the utilization of numerous diverse datasets, for evaluation purposes.

  Throughout the manuscript replace "Tensorflow*”, with "TextFlow".
  Inaccuracies; 
  The paper ought to include information about how features are computed for lemma (root form) part of speech (POS) or WordNet synset (grouping of synonymous words) and consider if this has an effect, on the overall assessment of similarity accuracy. 
  "Although its said that neural networks are utilized in Python code implementation it's crucial, for reproducibility to specify the availability of the code."
  The sharing method, for the training and evaluation sets is not clearly defined despite being noted as shared; this lack of specificity makes it challenging to reproduce the experiment accurately. 
Lets talk about topics.
