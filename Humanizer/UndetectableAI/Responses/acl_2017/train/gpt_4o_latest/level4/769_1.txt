This article presents an approach, to developing conversational agents involved in mutual collaborative activities where agents need to communicate strategically to reach a common goal. 
The paper caught my attention with its exploration of data driven methods for managing dialogues â€“ quite intriguing! My only reservation is that the approach seems geared towards tasks involving graph operations rather than being uniquely tailored to symmetric collaborative tasks where both participants share common knowledge and interact at intersections, between objects. 
Section 2 point one explains the setting of collaborative discussions outlined by the authors; though similar conversational scenarios have been examined before as seen in Clark and Wilkes Gibbs (1986)s study and Walkers task, on arranging furniture (Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research from 2000).
In line 229 of the text they mention that the subject matter is too intricate for slot value semantics according to the authors; yet considering their content revolves around attribute value pairs it could possibly be depicted using a structure grounded in attribute value pairs, like first order logic. 
It's quite difficult to understand Section 3. I often see them mentioning Figure 3 in there. It doesn't really help me grasp the concept well enough. I found an example, in Section 3 that wasn't very clear either. It's hard to figure out where in the conversation it fits in. Just not sure if it happens after "Did anyone go to Columbia?" is said or not.
