**Advantages;**  
This paper presents a method to enhance A* CCG parsing by integrating dependency details into the process successfully balancing speed and manageability. Which is an impressive feature of this approach. The application of precomputed attachments is an efficient strategy that adds value to the overall process. Moreover I appreciated the analysis on how head rules affect normal form violations; it was quite enlightening. I am curious to learn more, about the unresolved instances mentioned. 
Areas, for improvement;   
We require an examination of particular dependency patterns in the analysis process.I am especially interested, in how the method deals with coordination and relative clauses when the predicate object arrangement of CCG differs from the dependency structures commonly used by parsers. 
Lets chat about topics.   
I must say that I am genuinely impressed by this piece of work and view it as an addition to the field of study. The only area that I believe could be enhanced is delving deeper into the types of structures that demonstrated enhancements (in both English and Japanese) along with addressing how predicate argument dependencies align, with those utilized by other dependency parsers as previously mentioned.
