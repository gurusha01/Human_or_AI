Strengths; 
This research delves into using NLP techniques on speech transcripts (stories and explanations) to identify individuals with cognitive impairment (MCI). The researchers state that their approach can distinguish between individuals and those with MCI; however they note in the conclusion that the accuracy of 60% 85% highlights the ongoing challenge of differentiating between healthy people and those, with cognitive issues. The beginning appears hopeful, than its ending; however the overall message is positive and captivates readers curiosity to delve deeper into comprehending both methodology and outcomes in more depth. 
The research paper includes transcripts from 20 individuals with health and 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (20+20). Since the data is in language which might not be understandable for those who don't speak Portuguese fluently; adding additional technical information like a translated snippet of a short transcript and perhaps a sample network with embeddings, for that transcript could improve its readability and comprehensibility. 
Things that are not strong; 
The paper starts with an introduction and a thorough overview of previous research; however some of the references mentioned seem unrelated or unnecessary. For example (Salton 1989) discussed in section 4 point two point three is more focused on NLP background. May not be crucial. Likewise mentions of topics such as "sentiment classification" and "pedestrian detection, in images" (lines six hundred fifty two to six hundred fifty four) are not directly applicable. Could be left out as well. In terms of the papers content structure refinement may require condensing section 4. 235 ( Lines 608. 621 ) And initial five pages to emphasize the central theme more effectively. Moreover the writers should explore further into the advancements by providing instances of how the ABC and/or Cinderella stories are translated into English. 
The brief stories in Portuguese found in the ABC dataset inquiries regarding the process of identifying word similarities for creating word embeddings.The authors discuss creating word level networks from continuous word representations, in lines 272 to 289; however it remains uncertain where these representations originated from.Did they stem exclusively from the ABC and Cinderella datasets. Were external datasets also employed? In the section as before (lines 513 to 525) the writers discuss the utilization of sub word level (ngrams) networks for creating embeddings; however; they do not specify the source of training for these embeddings nor is it evident whether merging both network types enhances precision accuracy quality Also; a clarification is required regarding the source of the ", out of vocabulary words" alluded to in line 516. 
Lets talk about this in general. 
The emphasis of the research on using NLP to identify impairments is important and of great value. Another interesting point is its usage, in language that has less NLP tools as compared to English. It would be helpful for the authors to explain in detail how embeddings were calculated for Portuguese considering the limited resources available. 
The document could use some refinements by simplifying sections 4 through 6 and offering a thorough description of the experimental configuration details. Also worth exploring is an explanation on the NURP/AP ND 338 EF and 331 D4 transcription standards, for clarity. 
Technical feedback; 
Line 029 asks if it should be "as, in a lightweight" of "as it a lightweight."

Line 264 contains repeated words, which can be seen as redundant. 
In Table 3, for row 2 and column 3 the value should read as "72 point zero."
The DOI number matches the one mentioned in lines 10016 and 10002. 
Lines 992 and 993 contain a hyperlink that directs to the paper listed in the document.
