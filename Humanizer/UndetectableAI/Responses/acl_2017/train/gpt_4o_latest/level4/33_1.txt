The benchmarks used for comparison are quite disappointing. Lack thorough consideration.   
Lets talk about topics.
This research suggests an enhancement to the LSTM model by incorporating sentiment details through regularization techniques in a more user friendly manner for better performance results in comparison to CNN based approaches that struggle without precise phrase level guidance due, to the high cost associated with phrase level labeling as mentioned in the initial part of the paper introduction where they also introduce an alternative "basic model" utilizing various linguistic references instead.   
The section on related research offers a summary of the literature concerning sentiment analysis but does not include any references to previous studies, on linguistic regularization like [source; YOG14].  
The explanation of regularizers in Section 3 is too long and redundant.There is room to combine the list on page 2 with subsections 3A–3D for reading.In this part of text there are inconsistencies in notation that make it hard to understand.For example the symbol \( p \) is used as both a subscript and a superscript and \(\beta\) isn't clearly explained in writing.Aside, from that the expression "position \( t \)" lacks clarity. While \( t \) which is a parameter in LSTM output and seems to denote a sentence index,\( p_t \) according to descriptions of regularizers in preceding words than sentences.The implication is that \( p_t \) might be used for both sentence sentiment and word indication; however a clear explanation is necessary, in the text.   
There is an issue with the paper as it mixes up regularization and distant supervision without clear distinction between them.The paper suggests ways to include lexical details like polarity or negation in a model (for instance adding this information into features). It raises concerns about the comparison with Teng et al.s NSCL model due to uncertainty about the use of lexicons, in both instances which could result in an unfair assessment. Moreover‚ its puzzling why the authors didn't test NSCL on the MR dataset‚ as it would only require swapping datasets around‚ The other baselines don't make use of data‚ which leaves them relatively ineffective‚ A more robust baseline‚ like a basic LSTM, with added lexical information to word vectors‚ would have been a better choice.   
The paper ends by providing an examination of the models performance and shows that it grasps concepts such as emphasis and denial to a certain extent. It would be interesting to assess how well the model deals with words compared to known ones in its vocabulary. This evaluation could shed light on whether the model goes beyond rote learning. Moreover the size of the images and charts is too small to read in print form making it harder to follow along, with the content.   
The article is well written overall but could use some proofreading to fix any grammar mistakes and typos present, in it.The abstract section can be a bit tricky to understand from the start.   
Overall the paper delves into a research path that seems promising to explore further aspects of the study at hand.As for improvements I think a robust comparison to previous work could enrich the analysis by incorporating more solid foundational frameworks.It is vital to ensure that the experiments are comparable. I look forward to the authors offering additional insights, on this matter in their response.

I'm sorry. I cannot provide a paraphrased response, without the original text you want me to rewrite. Could you please provide the input text for me to work on?
I cannot provide a response, without a text to work with. Feel free to provide me with the text you'd like me to paraphrase.  
Thank you for acknowledging and responding to the issues raised about the setup, for the experiment.   
I think it's fair to say that the comparison with Teng and others is now convincing, to me.   
It's comforting to see that they included this baseline in their study—it's an aspect of the paper overall. The comparison with the baselines seems lacking. The described improvement is not thoroughly explained. Having a thorough comparison, with significance testing could really bolster the findings.   
While I grasp the definition of the model enough to comprehend its behavior with out of vocabulary (OOV) words could offer a more intriguing experiment compared to the current emphasis, on regularization.
