Strengths;   
The document offers instructions and precise visual aids. 
Shortcomings;   
The trustworthiness of crowdsourced annotations that are not tied to documents is uncertain. 
Lets talk about some topics.  
This research presents a standard dataset, for summarizing multiple documents using concept maps (CDMS). The article is well organized and written in a to understand manner with detailed supplementary resources provided as well. However,   
Is it essential to consider concept map extraction, as a task?   
Concerning summarization systems; while some create comparable knowledge graphs as a preliminary stage prior to producing summaries; it is noted that heightened node numbers can lead to more complexity, in understanding the concept map; henceforth making general summaries potentially more reader friendly.   
How can one assess the significance of an idea without relying on the materials associated with it?   
When summarizing information from documents like in the case of coal mining accidents topic there are concepts that need to be preserved as their significance can vary depending on the context they are presented in. Such, as an actual occurrence of a coal mining accident and what led to such accidents happening in the first place. If the document mainly talks about coal mining accidents one, after another in a series of events concept A would carry weight than B does Conversely if the document delves into what causes these accidents concept B would take precedence over A Without the context given by the documents its hard to accurately judge which of concepts A and B holds more importance  
The authors have put in a lot of work to create this dataset which seems to lean more towards a sense based knowledge graph rather than being a true summarization dataset.
