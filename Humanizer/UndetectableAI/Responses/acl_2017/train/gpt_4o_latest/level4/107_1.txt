This paper presents methods that use limited supervision to create Named Entity Recognizers (NER) by transferring information from English to another language. Although the general approach is not groundbreaking in itself the suggested techniques offer enhancements to current practices. Considering it's a submission, for ACL I expected to see original ideas and contributions.
A key highlight of the paper is the approach to selecting data for analysis. The method for calculating the quality score is simple and not necessarily a disadvantage. However the procedure for setting the thresholds in Table 2 lacks clarity. The paper states that several thresholds were experimented with but does not clarify if this was carried out on a test dataset. This absence of detail leaves readers unsure, about how to adjust these parameters for a dataset or language combination despite the evaluation findings emphasizing the significance of data selection. 
Another important aspect is the merging of results, from both systems outlined in the document; however the description of how this merger operates lacks clarity and despite my attempts to comprehend it. 
The article also delves into versions of the suggested approaches pondering if integrating more, than two loosely supervised systems could be advantageous and questioning whether the authors conducted experiments using such combinations. 
It would greatly improve the paper if specific information about the kinds of texts present in the ", in house" dataset were provided for better clarity and thoroughness.
