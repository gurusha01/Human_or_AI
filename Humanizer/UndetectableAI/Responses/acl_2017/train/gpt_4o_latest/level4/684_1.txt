This article presents a gated attention (GA) approach designed for enhancing machine reading comprehension abilities by incorporating a fine grained gated filter to facilitate multi hop reasoning within the framework of the Attention Sum Reader (inspired by Kadlec et al., 2016). The method is not interesting and easy to grasp for improving machine reading tasks but also shows promising performance improvements on standard datasets; however I have concerns about its suitability for publication, in ACL given certain limitations. 
The suggested gated attention concept seems hopeful. Lacks clear evidence of its superiority compared to other advanced systems due, to the notable influence of specific engineering tactics highlighted in Section 3 one four on enhancing reported accuracy levels which complicates the assessment of GA mechanisms genuine effectiveness. 
The references in the bibliography seem to be lacking as they mostly refer to arxiv preprints of published versions which could raise doubts, about how extensively the work has been compared to existing research studies. 
The findings from research (GA) listed in Tables 1 and 3 pose some issues. The GA baseline mentioned is referred to as work but exists only as an unpublished preprint. Including findings may not be necessary and could lead to confusion. I suggest substituting it with a GA model or a variation of the proposed method as a benchmark. Displaying results from a preprint that coincides with this ACL submission undermines the credibility of the manuscript. To maintain fairness, in the review process I refrained from seeking out the preprint on arXiv. 
There seems to be a discrepancy between the data in Tables 1 and 2 regarding the relationship between GA  and K values in Table 2. AS corresponds to K equals 1 and GA aligns with K equals 3 in Table 2.Are we suggesting that GA  is essentially the, AS Reader or if it represents a revised version of the AS Reader is ambiguous. In Table 2 where K equals 3 (AS) I thought the model also utilized GloVe initialization and token attention mechanisms; however it appears that this is not the case, for GA  according to my observation of the data provided. 
The section discussing studies would be stronger with a clearer comparison, to existing research findings emphasizing the distinctions and enhancements offered by the new method. 
Figure 2 showcases how well the gated attention mechanism enhances a hop architectures performance effectively and convincingly.The visualization is impressive; however it would be more persuasive to provide examples with comparisons to better highlight the advantages of the suggested approach.
