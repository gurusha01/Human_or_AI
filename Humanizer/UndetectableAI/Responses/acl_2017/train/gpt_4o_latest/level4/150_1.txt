Advantages; 
The article presents an approach, to encoder decoder neural machine translation (MT) that starts and ends with characters but incorporates morpheme and character representations in between stages. 
The writers make their codebase and trained models openly available, for the language pairs fr en, cs en and en cs. This transparency allows other researchers to verify their discoveries and encourages replication and deeper investigation into the matter. 
The system being suggested shows that it can generate translations of quality even beyond the first training session and continues to improve with each subsequent session. 
The system efficiently grasps breakdowns and shows the ability to manage words it has never encountered before. Even new ones. By automatically switching to morpheme based representations. 
Areas of improvement; 
The research paper fails to mention the WMT test and development sets utilized for the results provided making it challenging for readers to compare them with previous studies (such as those, on matrix.statmt.org). The reviewer only found this information by referring to the README file in the code which indicates that the test set is newstest2015 and the development set is newstest2013. This crucial detail should have been clearly stated in the paper itself. 
The instructions in the software README are okay. Could use some enhancements. It would be helpful to include examples for running the training and testing sections. Also it would be good to have a ` help' option in the software, as its currently missing. 
The document describes a structure with six layers; however the visual in Figure 2 seems to show than six layers which is confusing.There should be detailed information in the caption of the figure and if all layers are not shown in the figure then another illustration (possibly, in an appendix as well) should be included to present the full architecture. 
The findings contrast the system with other character based neural machine translation (MT) models but lack comparisons with leading results from different types of MT systems like those presented in WMT (and matrix.statmt.org). Data from these sources suggest that the top notch performance, on these datasets surpasses the outcomes detailed in this paper by a margin  a discrepancy that merits recognition and perhaps deliberation within the paper itself. 
There are a small problems with the way English is written here; things like mistakes in spelling and punctuation and issues, with how quotes are formatted in LaTeX need fixing. 
Casual Conversation; 
The article makes an addition to the existing research, on character based neural machine translation.
