This study presents a dataset containing product annotations from internet cybercrime forums.The research paper is well organized and written in a manner with experiments that are conducted skillfully.Every hypothesis is extensively. Contrasted with alternative ones. 
However I do have a worries, about the document. 
It seems like the writers tweaked the size and spacing in the abstract to make it longer and stay within the 8 page restriction. 
I think this document doesn't really fit into the tagging and parsing field; instead it seems to be more suited, for an information extraction task. 
It's difficult for me to see the link between annotations, like "sombody" in Figure 1 and a particular product. 
The basic results shown are quite simple and basic if you ask me! With all the NLP tools there today I believe we could have come up with more advanced baselines without much extra work. 
In the domain adaptation studies done on user generated content highlight knowledge about how text features differ across forums because of various user factors like age and gender diversity, among users present there However these findings don't offer any new perspectives on this particular matter.
