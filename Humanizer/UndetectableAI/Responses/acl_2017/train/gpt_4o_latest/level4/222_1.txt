Strengths; 
The writers effectively set the stage by providing examples and clearly stating the papers contributions.   
The section on Previous Studies provides an examination of current research practices while also pointing out the commonalities and distinctions, between earlier studies and the approach being suggested.   
The technique is explained clearly with a distinct division, between the tagging system and the complete model structure.   
The work also stands out for its use of solid baseline comparisons that enable a thorough assessment of the proposed methods, against various traditional triplet extraction techniques.   
Having real life examples from the dataset to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches is very helpful indeed! These results nicely support the description of the tagging system and the assessment of triplets.   
"Areas, for improvement;" 
One significant aspect of this paper is the labeling system outlined in Section 3. 3. Nonetheless there exist known tagging methods for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), like IO, BIO and BILOU.   
Were any tests carried out by the authors to try tagging methods with this approach?   
On line 14 of page 5 in the dataset section mentioned by the authors includes details about 24 relations, without outlining the count or categories of named entities involved in them.   
In Section 4. 14 They introduce the evaluation standards, for triplets. Did these standards originate from studies ? It seems like the entity identification process is not fully done when only the entitys head is taken into account.   
For instance in Table 4s S4 entry, from the LSTM LSTM Bias model evaluation. Was the correctness of the output deemed accurate according as indicated by the text itself if the relational role is deemed inaccurate; however it remains uncertain if this influences the assessment process.   
Lets talk about some topics.
This article presents a labeling system and investigates comprehensive models for simultaneously extracting entities and relationships.   
The article is nicely organized and easy to follow; this makes it easier to grasp the method being proposed.
