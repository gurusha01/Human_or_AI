Hello Authors, 
Thank you for responding to our feedback and addressing the questions we had in detail; it has provided clarity for us all! Your dedication, to sharing the code is truly commendabl  
Taking everything into consideration I have decided to increase my score to 4. 
Advantages; 
The article is nicely crafted. 
The research involves a range of experiments. 
The outcomes are reliable. 
Areas, for improvement include; 
The project doesn't introduce any innovations and mainly utilizes already existing technologies. 
The code has not been made accessible yet. 
The outcomes are as anticipated and do not bring about any revelations. 
Casual Conversation; 
Why didn't you use audio features, like MFCC when working on this project? 
Minor Specifics; 
In cases, like L155 it should be "an LSTM," not " a LSTM."
In places, like L160 and L216 Why do you see hyphens after the text? 
The description of convolution is not very clear. 
Table 1 should be relocated to a section, like page 2 since it has already been referenced. 
Is the use of 3 CNN a common method in video processing or are there other options available, for consideration? 
The caret (^) probably needs to go above the "Y."
"Did you intend to say 'to prevent overfitting' instead of 'to check overfitting'?"
Consider using quotation marks or italics to highlight names like L403 and 408, for readability. 
"The correction should be 'an SVM' instead of' a SVM."
"L448 states that the correct term to use is either 'Outputs or 'is,' instead of 'Output... Are'."
There is a space, after "layer."
"The term 'concatenate' should continue on the line without starting a new one."
Why do we not know the number of individuals involved in the situation? 
Please provide the text that needs to be paraphrased so I can assist you further.
Sorry,. I can't provide a direct rewrite without first understanding the context of your text. Can you please provide me with the input you'd like me to paraphrase?
Sure thing! Here is the paraphrased text; "L777 should have a "hand, on the other."
There are some issues with the references that need to be fixed;. Remove whitespace in L823. Add "Munich" in L831. Clarify what "ACL (1)" refers to in L860. Eliminate the extra closing parenthesis in L888. Include "Volume" in L894. Remove extra new lines in L951. Properly indent "linguistics‚Äù, in L956
