The paper is written overall and addresses a meaningful problem, with the proposed multigraph based model as a variant of MH showing robust empirical results with promise. 
"Areas that need explanation include a few weaknesses."
In Section 3 of your work when discussing the previous model MH model it's crucial to emphasize the shortcomings or challenges faced with MH that inspired the creation of your model explicitly. 
In Section 4 of the document or text provided on in the discussion thread above (not sure if it's a report or something else) the reason or purpose behind including separators is not clearly explained or understood by readers, like myself who are trying to make sense of it all through our human eyes and minds rather than just relying on T/I/O (which stands for something specific that we're supposed to remember or know). What do these separators tell us that isn't already covered by T/I/O alone? 
Section 5 does not provide a reason why the suggested model performs better, than MH. 
Section 5 discusses things in a way thats hard to grasp the reasons why the new model is better than MH, without some clear examples of false structures to help explain your points better. 
The paper presents an approach to identifying entities that overlap in text content and shows enhancement compared to the existing top performing model MH across various standard datasets; nevertheless the specific reasons and methods, for this improved performance need more clarification and explanation.
