This paper presents a technique to improve existing methods for the lexical substitution task by integrating word sense inventories to screen substitution options more effectively. The authors begin by introducing a measure to assess how sense inventories can substitute each other based on human evaluations for the lexsub task and then test the substitutability using inventories from different sources like WordNet and PPDB. Following this evaluation is a suggestion, for a view clustering strategy that groups paraphrases from PPDB for a single word to automatically create sense inventories instead of depending on pre established ones. Finally they use these groups along with a mostly, in the top 5 positions) word sense disambiguation method to improve the ordered list of alternative options. 
Strengths; 
The concept of merging vector space model approaches with sense inventories for the lexsub task shows potential because these methods offer additional useful information that can be beneficial, in situations where vector space models struggle to distinguish between senses and deal with words having multiple meanings. 
The assessment by the oracle is quite valuable as it sets a standard for the benefits that could be attained in an ideal situation.The discernible difference between the oracle and real scores highlights the progress, from the initial GAP to the oracle GAP and emphasizes the effectiveness of the suggested method. 
"Areas needing improvement;"
The view clustering approachs effectiveness remains uncertain based on various evaluations as the paraphrase similarity view consistently surpasses other views and their amalgamation in most cases This brings up doubts regarding the relevance of the other perspectives presented in the study In one empirical instance involving the term 'slip' the paper demonstrates how distinct views contribute to clustering However there is a lack of in depth analysis, on how these perspectives vary or work together. To come to conclusions about their individual usefulness requires delving further into the similarities and distinctions, in their perspectives. 
The paper is a bit confusing at glance because the links between different parts are not very clear which gives it a disjointed feel overalll For instance its hard to see how section 2 aligns with section 4; having pointers connecting them could make it easier to follow along Also the section, about multi view clustering needs some polishing up since the subheadings seem all over the place and few references are missing like in lines 392 and 393
The subpar results with nouns raise concerns as expected strong results from TWSI are now overshadowed by the performance of the oracle GAP, for PPDBClus in surpassing most clustering methods. A perplexing discovery that warrants further examination to understand this disparity fully.The revelation also challenges the assertion of applicability across all parts of speech made in lines 124 126 as it is evident that the performance outcomes exhibit notable discrepancies. 
Lets talk about some topics.
The article uses methods and tests to show advancements in the lexsub task through a dual strategy approach that could lead to more enhancements, with the inclusion of stronger WSD algorithms. 
Here are a more questions, for the writers; 
What is the reason for incorporating narrower terms, in the discussion? 
Why does X^{p need to have symmetry in place? 
The choice of the weighting scheme seems a bit random to me here. Was it truly a decision or was there a logical reason, behind it? 
Does the exceptional performance of SubstClus^{p } result from adjusting the cluster count based on this perspective be affected by adjusting the clusters using matrices to change the outcomes and conclusions? 
Is it possible for this method to be applied to tasks similar, to lexsub or is it designed specifically for this task alone?
