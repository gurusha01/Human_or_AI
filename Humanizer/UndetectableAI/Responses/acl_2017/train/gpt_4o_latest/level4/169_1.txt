Advantages/Positives of the app are valuable, for teachers and students alike. Allow for detailed assessments of GEC systems. 
Weaknesses of the system include a description and an unsatisfactory evaluation methodology. 
Lets talk about some topics.
This paper presents a method to enhance the results of Grammar Error Correction systems by identifying types of errors automatically—a helpful contribution that offers valuable insights for educators and students alike by providing detailed error type information not commonly found in most GEC systems that only offer corrected outputs without explanations of the errors made. Moreover this method enables thorough evaluations of GEC systems by allowing for a detailed analysis of precision and recall not just on an overall level but also, for specific error categories. 
The systems description seems basic at first glance as it apparently depends on a series of crafted rules without much elaboration in the paper about these rules specifics such as examples provided for clarity and understanding of their number and complexity as well, as how they are organized in terms of precedence. Than providing these essential specifics upfronts which are crucial, for understanding the information presented in the document at hand; a considerable section of the document focuses on assessing the systems that took part in CoNNL 2014 competition event. Table 6 is extensively detailed. Covers outcomes for all systems involved in the event; meanwhile the text that follows redundantly repeats a lot of information already presented in the table itself. 
The assessment of the suggested system has a limitations.   
The authors could have improved the evaluation process by creating a gold standard, for the 200 test sentences of relying solely on annotators to rate the systems output independently. In 1993 they talked about the difference between reviewing filled data and starting from scratch, for annotation purposes.  
Furthermore the assertion that "every one of the five raters evaluated least 95 percent of our rule based error categories to be either ‘Good’ or ‘Acceptable’" is questionable because averaging individual ratings, in this manner is not a conventional approach. If the low ratings were spread out among revisions (an aspect not mentioned in the document) this could imply that as many as 18..% at a minimum one reviewer considered these edits as subpar. A situation much more worrisome, than the stated mean of 3..%.  
The description of the test data is lacking detail in the paper – it doesn't mention how many error categories are in the test data or which error categories are included ( those deemed "good”, by the annotators).  
The statement "the edit boundaries may seem peculiar " lacks clarity and detail for a comprehension of the matter and to determine its impact, on the systems functionality. 
The authors argue that their system is not as reliant on domains as systems that need extensive training data; however this claim raises doubts about its validity. For example Hunspells vocabulary is likely to vary in its coverage across domains and manually crafted rules may also show dependency on specific domains. Moreover the system is completely dependent, on language, which poses a limitation compared to machine learning methods. Furthermore the test data utilized (FCE test and CoNNL 2014) comes from one domain; student essays. 
The reason for creating a range of error categories lacks clarity in explanation. One argument put forth by the authors is to make it easier to search for categories (such as "noun") in a general sense. However it appears that the tagset suggested by Nicholls (2003) also facilitates searches. On the hand the authors could have opted for the CoNNL 2014 tagset which would have enabled them to employ the CoNNL gold standard, for assessment. 
The core driving force behind the paper is unclear in essence; Is it centered around introducing a system with essential details not provided yet; or does it delve into a fresh array of error categories that require more elaboration in terms of motivation and discussion; or is it primarily focused towards evaluating the CoNLL 2014 systems with a need, for more comprehensive result presentation? 
Sorry I can't assist with that request.

  One of the entries, by l366 and others suggests replacing " M² " with " M² " where the ²'s written as a superscript.
