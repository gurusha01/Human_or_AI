The research paper addresses an issue of understanding how natural language corresponds to knowledge base (KB) relationships in the realm of question answering (QA) especially under circumstances where only limited information is accessible, for one argument and when there exists an extensive array of possible target relations. 
The new technique presents a way to merge two different ways of representing the input text. One, at the word level that includes breaking down both the target relation names and the input text and another representation where relations are viewed as single units without breaking down relation names or input text segments. 
It seems like an important aspect of quality assurance is the models capability, to reorder entities after the Entity Linking process has been completed. 
The results from the experiment show enhancements, in performance compared to the technology available. 
Areas, for improvement;   
The assessment was carried out on a set of data. 
Lets talk about topics.  
How, about moving Section 3â€Œ to the work section and making the proposed method the focus of the new Section 3? This way we could divide the content effectively and ensure a smoother structure.
