This research delves into the application of convolutions in sequence tagging and specifically focuses on named entity recognition (NER). It presents ideas, like sharing the dilated convolution block and making tag predictions at different convolutional levels that I think will bring significant value to the research field. The authors carry out ablation studies to showcase the efficiency of their method. The writing is very clear. The experimental assessment is extremely detailed. 
Advantages;   
In depth comparative analyses were conducted using structures such, as LSTM and LSTM combined with CRFs.   
Innovative architectural and training approaches, such, as block sharing are being introduced in the field.   
Areas, for improvement;   
The evaluation of the technique focuses on English Named Entity Recognition (NER) which raises concerns, as the title of the paper suggests a wider relevance to sequence tagging.   
In Section 4 of your document could be clearer; it might help to mention the use of padding to ensure a consistent output resolution, across different blocks.   
Studying how the number of layers affects performance could offer valuable insights.   
In reply, to the authors rebuttal;   
Thank you for your considerate reply! I've adjusted my rating in light of the authors decision to refine the papers focus towards Named Entity Recognition (NER) than general sequence tagging.
