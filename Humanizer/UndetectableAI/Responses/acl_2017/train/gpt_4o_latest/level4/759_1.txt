This study presents a combined approach for identifying phrases and predicting discourse relationships in verbal discussions during meetings with tests, on meeting datasets showing that the suggested method surpasses a classifier based on SVM algorithms. 
"Advantages;"  
The article is nicely. Clear to understand.It gives an explanation of technical aspects and performs well in the experimental assessment.Additionally it makes comparisons with previous research on analyzing discourse structure and identifying key phrases.Of note is the examination of phrase selection from discourse discourse relation labeling and summary generation as well as its potential, in forecasting team members’ comprehension consistency—a fascinating aspect to explore. 
"Areas, for improvement;"   
A new idea has been suggested about linking the identification of phrases and assigning discourse relationships during conversations between speakers in a unified way, in research papers could be strengthened by providing a clearer explanation of how they rely on each other and the advantages of recognizing this connection. 
Lets talk about this in general.  
The baseline for our experiments is the SVM based classifier. Its important that we explain why we chose this approach in order, for the experimental setup validation process.
