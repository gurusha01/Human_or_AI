This study presents an approach to translating text from languages with limited word structure (like Chinese) to languages with complex word structures (such as Spanish) through a two phase procedure; Initially creating a simplified form of the desired language and then determining specific morphological traits, for each word before adding appropriate inflections based on those traits. 
Although the writers focus on a language pair in their study I believe that the issue discussed in this research is both important and not thoroughly explored in current machine translation (MT). The approach suggested differs from modern techniques such as BPE and character level models; instead it takes cues from earlier methods like "Factored Translation Models" by Koehn and Hoang (2007) and "Translating into Morphologically Rich Languages, with Synthetic Phrases" by Chahuneau et al., (2013). Regrettably the paper does not reference these works. 
However I do have some concerns about the fact that the authors only mentioned METOR scores without including any reference to BLEO or providing any assessments in their report If the BLEO scores do not show any improvement it would be helpful if the authors could explain why their approach is still effective, by using METOR results and presenting sample sentences as evidence. 
Furthermore the article highlights the importance of considering gender and number as linguistic characteristics but overlooks the aspect of person which is equally crucial in languages with complex morphology. This absence could be attributed to the occurrence of first person and second person pronouns and verbs in news datasets however it deserves some attention. Additionally there is a lack of explanation in the article regarding why adjusting scores has a negative effect, on gender accuracy. If the accuracy rates are high shouldn't the reranker be able to learn to preserve the hypothesis? 
In conclusion even though the paper shows potential it needs improvements in spelling, grammar, word selection and style before it can be considered for publication. I have outlined errors and recommendations, for enhancement below. 
I believe this work should be showcased at a conference with the inclusion of more language pairs and evaluation metrics, after thorough proofreading. 
Here is a list of errors identified;

Table 1 needs adjustments to address the spaces in "cuestión" at the start and "titulado" at the end of the rows along with emphasizing discrepancies between rows for better understanding of the content; it should also provide insights into whether the simplifier is manually crafted or reliant, on a pre existing tool.
