Strengths Review; 
The paper presents a learning framework for recurrent neural network language models that shows better performance, than the standard SGD with dropout on three different tasks.   
Using Bayesian learning in RNN seems like an addition, to the field.   
The new effective Bayesian algorithm for RNN models could garner considerable attention from the NLP community because of its versatility, in different tasks. 
Areas of improvement; 
The main issue revolves around how the evaluation method's conducted. 
In Section 5 point 1 of this research paper analyzes structures (such as LSTM / GRU / vanilla RNN) for character level language modeling and compares learning methods using data from the Penn Treebank dataset. Moreover it contrasts RMSprop and pSGLDG for character level tasks while looking at SGD with or without dropout against SGLDG with or without it for word level tasks. This lack of consistency, in evaluation presents an issue. It would be better to show outcomes for both aspects (architectures and learning methods) covering both character level and word level language modeling tasks to evaluate if the suggested Bayesian learning approaches work well across tasks and data sets.   
The paper argues that the improvement in performance is primarily due, to incorporating noise and model averaging techniques; yet this assertion lacks empirical evidence to back it up convincingly.A/B testing that specifically examines the impact of noise and model averaging is essential to validate this claim.   
Gals dropout is only assessed for the sentence classification task and not for language modeling or captioning tasks even though it can be applied beyond sentence classification tasks; thus its effectiveness should be tested across all three tasks to offer a thorough evaluation of the new algorithms relative, to current dropout techniques.   
The paper does not specify if the samples (θ₁,... Θₖ) are arranged in an order like by posterior probability or not. Moreover the authors might consider presenting outcomes for choosing K samples from S as an alternative approach to gain more understanding of the effectiveness of the sampling method.   
Recurrent neural network (RNN) language models are considered to require significant computational resources for training and assessment processes compared to other approaches like Bayesian learning algorithms and stochastic gradient descent (SGC) with dropout technique, which are being suggested in this context for performance evaluation purposes to help readers assess the trade offs, between enhanced performance and computational demands more effectively. 
Clarifications; 
What is the meaning of \(\theta_s\) here. Does it indicate the MAP estimate of the parameters derived only from sample \( s \)?  
Could you explain what \(\theta\) represents in relation to dropout and dropconnect techniques?
