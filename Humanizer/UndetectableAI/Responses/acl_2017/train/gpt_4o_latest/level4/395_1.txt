This article suggests a technique for creating meaning embeddings from collections through a step by step approach to choosing and depicting meanings in modules.The process of learning is seen as a challenge in reinforcement learning. Carried out through communication, between the two modules using a message passing system. 

The paper is written overall with clear presentation of ideas and relevant comparisons to related studies when needed.The experiments are well planned. Though the findings are not revolutionary they are sound.However I have some concerns, about the paper that hold me back from giving it my support. 
One area needing improvement is; 
The main issue is the exaggeration of the points, in the paper that may not always match their real significance. 
The word "deep" appears frequently in the title and throughout the document;. The authors utilize a skip gram structure which lacks inherent depth—a discrepancy, in their approach. 
Reinforcement learning is highlighted as a focus in the paper; however the reasoning behind it and how its executed lack clarity. In Section 3.. It tries to explain the task as a reinforcement learning puzzle. Points out two significant limitations that result in utilizing a Q learning technique instead. Nonetheless this approach doesn't match the policy as stated earlier resulting in an inconsistency, in the storyline. 
The originality of the technique is uncertain at best as it mirrors the EM learning strategies closely. With the E step focusing on selecting an ideal sense and the M step enhancing a goal to refine sense representations accordingly.The authors fail to distinguish their method from EM or explain why reinforcement learning holds an advantage, over EM in this particular scenario. 
The phrase "pure sense representations' is frequently. Highlighted as a significant addition; yet its definition and advantages remain ambiguous and unsupported. 
The writers claim that their model can efficiently select senses in time according to the text, under review; however​ the evidence supporting this assertion is lacking​. Bringing attention to this point in the appropriate sections would enhance the overall clarity of their argument​.
The statement about attaining cutting edge outcomes is predominantly grounded on the MaxSim C standard. Different studies have showcased effectiveness by employing the AvgSim C standard. Although achieving top notch results isn't the parameter for assessing a research papers quality the declaration presented in the abstract and introduction might be somewhat deceptive due, to the constrained assessment scope.
