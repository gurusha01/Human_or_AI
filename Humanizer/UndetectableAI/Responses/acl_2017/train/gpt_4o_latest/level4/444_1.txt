The writers suggest using both human analyzed metrics like fluency and coherence alongside an automated metric for 'Similarity.' Although the concept of the Similarity metric is interesting and innovative in nature. However there is a lack of evidence in the paper to prove its efficiency as an automated metric since the connection, between this metric and the manual ones is weak. The authors themselves recommend utilizing these metrics. The authors claim that using the Similarity metric to assess system performance lacks evidence to support it since there is no proven link to any manually evaluated performance metric yet achieving lower scores than a baseline system doesn't automatically prove the metrics effectiveness in measuring quality (, for instance; the baseline system could be exceptionally robust).
The paper lacks important citations like recent studies focusing on automating coherence through mutual information density (for example Li et al., 2015). Furthermore​ references from the Natural Language Generation community regarding style compatibility are not included​, like the works of Dethlefs et al.(2014) and Pennebakers research​ ​on style matching.
