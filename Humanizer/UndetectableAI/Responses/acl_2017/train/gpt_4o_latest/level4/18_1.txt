"Advantages;"  
The report outlines a reasoned method, with an explanation and strong outcomes.

"No major vulnerabilities exist except, for the issues mentioned herein."
Lets chat about a variety of topics.   
The document presents an approach called attention over focus for understanding text better.The first stages of the system create a vector for every question and text word to form a matrix of size | Q | x K for the question and a matrix of size | D | x K for the text.Because the answer is linked to a word, in the text a mechanism is used to give importance to each word depending on how it relates to the question words. The authors enhance the attention mechanism by calculating a weight for each query word using a distinct attention approach and utilizing these weights to adjust the main focus on words in the document text thoroughly evaluated using standard datasets and results extensively analyzed with comparisons to previous research findings Overall this makes a significant contribution, to an important issue The approach is well justified and clearly explained allowing researchers to reproduce the outcomes and apply the methods to similar tasks
"Additional Comments;   
In section four, on Equation 12. When "I" is it going through each item in our training data set. Does "P(w)" mean P(w given D,Q) as mentioned in that equation you referenced to avoid any confusion?   
Have you thought about starting off with trained word embeddings like those from Google News or GloVe, for this purpose?   
The part mentioning "clarifying how GRUs indirectly impact attention towards query and document words in your architecture would be useful." Also noted that there is a 4% improvement, on validation score of 4%.  
  From looking at page 07 and Table 5 in your document what's your opinion on why there seems to be an emphasis on local Language Models, for CN tasks despite their lesser advantages ? I believe sharing your thoughts on this matter would provide clarity to readers since you've already included a table showcasing relevant data.   
Releasing the software as part of this submission would have added value to it.   
Sorry I cannot proceed with the task as you requested. If you have any requests or need help with something else feel free to let me know!  
"In my opinion and based on what I've observed in column two on page two, at line 162 of your document states that it is not as effective as initially anticipated."  
In sector 8 of page 689 in a column, on our side show that "appears more frequent".  
In section 9 of page 4 on lines 719 to 721, in column one of "the model finds it difficult to ". Challenging to create."
