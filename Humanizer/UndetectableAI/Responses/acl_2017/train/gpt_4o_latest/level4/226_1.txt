"Areas of excellence;"
The document presents a automatic framework (initial human input → automated expansion → human revision afterward) created to develop a dataset, for assessing the compositional similarity of meanings. 
A schema is utilized to create a dataset for assessing the similarity of compositional semantics and has the potential to enhance studies, on Polish compositional semantic models. 
"Areas, for improvement;"
The framework has only been tried out in one language far which has sparked some worries about how well it can work across different languages in general terms.Its use of a parser might not work as effectively in languages that don't have access, to or struggle with such parsers specifically. 
The research paper fails to mention how many sentence pairs were reviewed by the judges which makes it challenging to evaluate the effectiveness and speed of the automated expansion process system accurately. Moreover the fact that than 3% (369, out of 10 000 ) of the post edited pairs needed additional adjustments is worrying. 
The paper has a number of mistakes present, within it and some instances of such errors are given below; however this list is not exhaustive;
