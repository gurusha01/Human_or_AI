Strengths; 
This research explores an issue and presents a new method that seems well thought out for combining cognitive aspects with text features to conduct sentiment analysis and detect irony effectively in communication material. The report is clearly written with a flow and provides plenty of helpful specifics along with practical examples and insightful visuals. Most of the outcomes are persuasive. The authors have admirably compared their methods and results with previous studies, in the same area. 
Weaknesses; 
After reading the summary initially I had assumed the new technique would do much better than current methods and that using both eye gaze and text features together would always lead to better outcomes.. After looking at the results, in detail it seems the findings are more complex than expected. It might be helpful to adjust the summary and introduction to match what actually happened.   
Did the model consider remarks in dataset 1 when evaluating sentiment analysis performance and did it demonstrate stronger performance in categorizing non sarcastic remarks, than sarcastic ones?   
The importance of using eye movement data to detect sarcasm is apparent; however the added value of this data in improving sentiment classification, for sarcastic content is not as obvious compared to the capabilities of textual features alone.   
Lets talk about topics; 
This study presents a variety of thought provoking ideas. Suggests an approach that seems reliable and creative in nature. Although the outcomes were not as impactful as I had anticipated from the summary at glance the research retains its significance and is probably relevant, to a wide audience of scholars. I think it deserves to be published.
