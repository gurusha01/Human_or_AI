Sorry,. I can't do that. Would you like a summary instead?
Advantages; 
The model is based on theoretical principles and is supported by formal semantics with clear motivation. 
Areas of improvement; 
The paper mainly discusses the extraction of's a relationships but overlooks a substantial amount of previous literature on taxonomy creation. It does not refer to key works, in this area.
  Flati Tiziano along, with Vannella Daniele and Pasini Tommasom collaborated on the MultiWiBi project in 2016 to develop the Wikipedia bitaxonomy project. 
  In 2007 Soren Auer and his team published a paper titled "DBpedia. A Foundation, for an Open Data Web."
  Gerard de Mel and Gerhard Weikum co authored a study titled "MENTa" that focused on creating taxonomies using Wikipedia as a primary source. 
  Zornits Kozareva and Eduard Hovy published a method in 2010 that involves learning and building taxonomies using the internet with some supervision involved. 
  Vivi Nastase along, with Michael Strube and their colleagues published a research paper in 2010 titled "WikiNet," which delves into the realm of a multilingual concept network on a very large scale. 
  Simone Paolo Ponzetto and Michael Strube published a study in 2007 on creating a classification system using information, from Wikipedia. 
  Simone Paolo Ponzetto and Michael Strube authored a study, on deriving taxonomies from a constructed knowledge database in 2011. 
  Fabian M Suchanek collaborated with Gogji Kasneci and Gerhard Weikum in 2008 to create YAGO. An ontology sourced from Wikipedia and WordNet. 
  Paola Velardi along with Stefano Faralli and Roberto Navigli presented an updated version of Ontolearn in 2013 titled "A Graph Based Approach, for Building Taxonomies." 
The testing conducted is lacking as it only contrasts the suggested method with "patterns, by Hearst " neglecting to take into account the works mentioned earlier. 
Lets talk about this in general. 
The document is well presented with writing and useful supplementary content included; however it could benefit from more references to existing literature on is a relation extraction and taxonomization.The evaluation falls short by not providing comparisons with newer systems, beyond the Hearst patterns. 
While I have read the authors’ replies carefully I still have doubts about whether further assessments could have been carried out. Although the theoretical justifications are strong it is essential to conduct experiments to confirm if the authors’ theoretical ideas stand true in real world scenarios. Even if the referenced studies concentrate mainly on building taxonomies we can still draw comparisons by examining the connections, within a taxonomy. 
Having reviewed the authors’ feedback and the insights shared by the other reviewer carefully considered your response in depth and after thoughtful consideration I have decided to increase my rating to 3 stars, for this paper. Nonetheless I maintain the view that the paper lacks experimental breadth and could benefit from better contextualization within the wider field of is a relation extraction and taxonomy development literature.
