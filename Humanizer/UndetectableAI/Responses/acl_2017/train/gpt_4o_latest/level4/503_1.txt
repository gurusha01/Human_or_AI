This paper presents a task in evaluation because I think it offers important technical insights that can be preserved (particularly in the parsing algorithm). Nonetheless u00A0the overall coherence of the paper is lacking.u00A0It revolves around a theme on formal languages u00A0treating the concept of a language being "probabilistic" as a formal attribute similar to properties such as closure, under intersection. I don't think the idea of a language being probabilistic has been thoroughly examined enough in this presentation to really make the big picture seem convincing, from my perspective. 
The significance of the findings in the paper stands out regardless of the shortcomings, in the overall storyline structure. Henceforth it is essential to note that this does not indicate research but rather a paper that is inadequately composed and articulated requiring substantial revisions ahead. 
It's quite puzzling to me that the paper doesn't give attention to the parsing result and pushes the soundness and completeness proofs to supplementary materials instead of incorporating them into the main body of work."Probabilistic languages" included in the title seem misleading since there is no discussion or analysis involving probabilistic reasoning, in the submission. 
It seems like the importance of the intersection closure outcome discussed in Section 3 is exaggerated to some extent.I might be missing something about the limitations placed on the rules right hand sides (if so could you provide clarity?) but it appears that this outcome merely involves incorporating a finite intersection, into the group of non terminal labels.
