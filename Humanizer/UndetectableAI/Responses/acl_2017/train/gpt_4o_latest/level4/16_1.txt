Strengths;   
This study aims to utilize insights from discussions that are frequently disregarded but carry value to boost the effectiveness of event detection processes.The suggested approach is clear. Organized well.By integrating the attention mechanism. A commonly used and influential technique in multiple domains such as machine translation. The system demonstrates a significant enhancement, over the standard model. 
Areas, for improvement;   
The focus vector is created by adding the two attention vectors from each segment separately.Researching an intricate method for calculating the focus vector could produce superior outcomes.In relation, to the guided attention process discussed in this studys findings two uncomplicated strategies are suggested.Experimenting with advanced tactics may enhance overall effectiveness. 
Lets talk about topics.  
Although there are some areas that could use improvement this paper introduces a framework, with impressive performance. The experimental findings are reliable. The effort put into this work is commendable.
