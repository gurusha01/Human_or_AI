This paper presents a graph based technique to create synonym sets with sense disambiguation from a set of synonym sets without clarification of meaning​ using infSorry I cannot do that. If you have any requests or need assistance, with something else feel free to let me know!mation from Wiktionary and various Russian dictionaries​ to measure the accuracy of synonym relationships against established resources like WordNet and BabelNet for English synonyms​ as well as RuThes and Yet Another RussNet, for Russian synonyms. 
The paper was nicely. Organized in a clear manner. The experiments and assessments were easy to understand thanks to their explanations. The suggested approach seems solid. The interpretation of the findings is logical. I liked how the issues I had while reading the paper were tackled or resolved in the parts—like the difference in vocabulary, between synonym dictionaries and established standards. 
The authors research motivation is challenged by their misunderstanding of previous work. 
The initial confusion arises in the text beginning at line 064 when OmegaWiki is lumped together with Wiktionary and Wikipedia as sources that lack organization and have ambiguous synonyms." However,...
The paper points out a misconception in certain paragraphs starting at lines 092 		which state that both BabelNet and UBY depend on English WordNet for linking existing resources and criticizes this linking as prone to errors. 	Although it is true that BabelNet relies on WordNet for this purpose 	UBY does not follow the approach. 	In essence 	UBY serves as a framework designed to represent lexical and semantic resources along, with their connections. It works independently of any lexical and semantic resources like WordNet or alignment methods, like "similarity of dictionary definitions." UBY compliant databases may contain lexical and semantic resources aligned through various methods. Although users can search UBY databases for synsets UBY itself does not produce them; instead users have the ability to build their databases by importing resources and alignments that fit their requirements. Therefore the criticisms of UBY mentioned in lines 120–125 are unfounded. 
Furthermore there is a critique aimed at BabelNet that may not be entirely justified. The authors propose that Watset could surpass BabelNet because of the errors in BabelNets mapping and its dependence on machine translation. This suggests that Watsets approach is flawless or less prone, to errors a statement that may be too optimistic and lacks backing from the authors' own similarity based sense linking and graph clustering algorithms not to mention their experimental findings. This criticism should be toned down. Furthermore the third critique of BabelNet focusing much of its reliance upon WordNet overlooks a more important aspect. The main issue lies not in the pivot being English but rather, in its synsets already having been manually sense annotated. 
You should consider making changes to the final paragraph of section 1 and the initial two paragraphs of section 2. These parts should highlight the difficulty of creating synsets by aligning senses at a semantic level or translating lexical resources as outlined in Gurevych et al.s survey, from 2016 instead of solely concentrating on BabelNet (which uses particular techniques) and UBY (which combines outcomes from different approaches).It's worth mentioning that alignment and translation techniques may generate or enhance synsets; however this isn't always their objective – sometimes it's just a result of aligning resources, with varying levels of detail. 
The paper discusses the inclusion of hypernyms and co hypernyms in the "synsets" of TWSI and Jo Bin Text than just synonyms on lines 153 and 433 of the text critique document. However it's unclear if this is an issue with TWSI and Jo Bin Text as it doesn't specify how often hypernyms and co hypernyms are present in Watsets results. The comparison, between Tables 3 and 5 only gives an idea of this.If Watset does excel in distinguishing synonymous connections effectively as claimed there should be tangible proof presented. 
Some other small matters to take care of; 
The reference to Kiselev et al.s analysis, in 2015 lacks detail; a brief summary of their findings would enhance the clarity of the reference. 
The relationship between "wat'' and ''finding the meaning of a word'' is not clear in this context. If its meant to be a play on the word "what " you might want to consider revising the sentence for clarity or renaming the method to something, like "Whatset."
Figure 2 has text that's too small to read comfortably so it would be better to enlarge the font size, for easier readability. 
Tables 3 to 5 might be tough to read because of their font size; you could try using a larger font and abbreviating headers like "P," "R," "F" instead of the full words to improve readability and save space without leading zeros when reporting scores from 0 to 100 instead of 0, to 100.
