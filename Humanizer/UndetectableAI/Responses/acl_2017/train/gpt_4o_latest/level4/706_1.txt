I appreciate your reply. Am excited to read your thoughts on how incentives influence outcomes and the importance of clear communication, in this context. 
Please provide the text that needs to be paraphrased so I can assist you accordingly.
The paper presents a technique for creating interfaces that allows a team of individuals to establish fresh ideas and language structure collaborativelyâ€”a significant expansion of the method outlined in the study, by S.I Wang, P.Liang and C.Manning in 2016 on "Acquiring language skills through interactive communication." 
Could you please provide me with some inquiries?
How many words were used in the experiments? 
How does this work connect with studies, on reverse reinforcement learning and mimicking learning methods? 
Advantages; 
"The article is nicely. Effectively expressed."
It presents a method, for dealing with the task of handling a vast array of possible programs while mastering natural language interactions. 
Areas needing improvement; 
Could the authors provide details, on how incentives impact the ultimate results of the performance assessment and if they considered different incentive formats during their research process? 
The paper hints at the possibility of applying the method to real world situations but lacks clarity regarding the ease of extending it to domains with varying vocabulary sizes and potential challenges arising from increased ambiguity in language that need further exploration, beyond the current experimental setup. 
Adding an example would really make the paper more impactful.
