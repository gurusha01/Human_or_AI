Among the aspects are; 
  In the entity linking task analysis shows better results with the proposed framework, over ALIGN model which suggests improved learning of text and knowledge representations together. 
  It offers a comparison, with a closely related method using very similar input data. 
  The examination of the smoothing parameter provides insights because dealing with the impact of popularity continues to be an ongoing obstacle, in entity linking tasks. 
Weak points; 
  The analysis of ALIGN could be more comprehensive as it uses a content window size of 10 compared to the 5 used in this study and a vector dimension of 500 as opposed to the papers 200 dimensions. Moreover it is uncertain whether \( N(e_j)\ includes entities that are linked to \( e_j \). Although the graph is directed and constructed based on Wikipedia outlinks there is no clarity, on whether adjacency's defined similarly to an undirected graph. When it comes to ALIGN tools perspective on an objects context is based on objects that are associated with it directly or indirectly linking to it in some way or form. If the determination of \( N(e_j)\)s definition differs in this scenario it complicates the evaluation of how this change affects the generated vectors and could play a role in explaining why there are discrepancies in the similarity scores, between objects. 
  Sometimes the word "mention" can be confusing because its not always clear if it refers to a type of string or a specific reference, in a document. Although the term "mention embedding" is used it appears that embeddings are only created for senses of mentions. 
  Its challenging to assess the impact of sense disambiguation order without comparing it to unsupervised techniques for linking entities.
