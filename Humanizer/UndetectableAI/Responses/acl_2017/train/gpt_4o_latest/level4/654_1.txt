Lets chat about this topic; 
This study expands on the research presented at the ACL 2015 conference by Zhou and Xu by enhancing their BiLSTM method, for semantic role labeling using current cutting edge methods.They attain quantitative enhancements and supplement them with a detailed qualitative examination of their results.The paper is nicely written with a structure that includes an extensive examination of previous studies and compares the new model with various SRL models assessed on identical datasets. 
The paper was really interesting and convincing to me! It makes a research contribution by showing how neural networks can be effective for this job and also discussing the pros and cons of using an end, to end learning approach. 


Areas of improvement; 
The SRL task lacks understanding.
