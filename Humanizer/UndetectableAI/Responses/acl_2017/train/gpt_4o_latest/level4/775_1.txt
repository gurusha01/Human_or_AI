This study presents a technique for categorizing pairs of adjectives and nouns as either figurative expressions in writing or speech interactions based on their contexts and meanings. The researchers create a matrix that captures the relationships between adjectives and nouns using PMI scores as indicators in context. They then utilize methods to identify significant dimensions within this matrix to transform each adjective noun pair into a numerical vector representation. The properties of these vectors—both, in terms of their direction and magnitude—are used as attributes to train a model that distinguishes between figurative language expressions. The suggested method delivers results on par with studies that focus on creating vector representations, for descriptive words. 
Learning without Prior Training
The writers argue that their technique needs oversight compared to earlier methods and enables zero shot learning capabilities; however this assertion seems exaggerated and demands further explanation since it serves as a key point, in the paper. The method suggested involves a supervised classification task where vector representations are generated from co appearance data and these representations are utilized alongside accurate labels to teach the classifier. Even though the model can be evaluated using words not included in the training data sets list it doesn't actually improve its learning from those instances.The terms are also not entirely "new" since the model needs existing vector representations, for them beforehand. 
Analyzing the findings
The authors have thoroughly examined research on metaphors but the reasoning behind their methodology. Notably the utilization of geometric characteristics such as vector length for identifying metaphors. Remains somewhat unclear to me. For instance the justification, for incorporating normalized vectors seems uncertain especially considering that they do not seem to improve performance. Furthermore the noun vector emerges as the indicative feature, which the authors attribute to how the dataset was structured, with each adjective appearing in both metaphorical and literal contexts. Therefore the descriptive vector provides useful information which brings up questions, about how widely this method can be applied.   
From a standpoint (especially considering the papers submission to the cognitive track) it remains uncertain what new understanding this approach offers regarding theories, on how metaphors are processed.   
In terms of NLP applications perspective and their effectiveness when compared to models versatility pose doubts. 
Something new and different.
The approach to illustrating noun and adjective vectors is quite similar to the one used by Agres et al., with the focus of the study seeming to lie in leveraging geometric attributes for categorizing these vectors.
