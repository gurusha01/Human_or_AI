This study delves into an exploration, with the goal of revealing an underlying emotional aspect within word embeddings. 
Advantages
Tackles the job of conducting sentiment analysis without supervision. 
Figure 3 really catches the eye as an enlightening visualization. 
Areas of improvement
The assessment based on experiments lacks depth suggesting the importance of incorporating F measure performance metrics and expanding the variety of methodologies, for comparison purposes. 
The methodology section needs to be improved with organization and more detailed explanations provided for the tested ideas listed therein as they currently lack adequate justification. 
The findings presented are somewhat lacking in strength concerning both accuracy and the level of analysis provided in this studys context. Further refinement is recommended to validate the premise that the Distributional Hypothesis guarantees a clear distinction between opposing words, in the vector space despite their semantic similarities.
