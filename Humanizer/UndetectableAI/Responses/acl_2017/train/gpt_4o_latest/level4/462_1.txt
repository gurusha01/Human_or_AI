"Areas of expertise;"  
The document outlines a method that outperforms previous approaches and accomplishes top notch results.   
When it comes to data analysis and interpretation this approach seamlessly combines market insights, with information.   
The suggested method utilizes word embeddings to give significance to each term and extends these significances to similar terms, in the document.   
Shortcomings;   
Deep learning techniques are widely recognized for their results in sentiment analysis without the need, for extensive feature manipulation.With an examination of the relevant literature, the evaluation of existing studies could be enhanced.   
The increase in performance mainly comes from feature focused approaches than significant advancements, in the model itself or the introduction of new features.   
Lets talk about some topics.  
The document describes a method, for analyzing sentiments by utilizing word embeddings to assign weights to termsâ€”a technique that has gained popularity recently but lacks significant innovation in the proposed approach.
