The study analyzes the concluding statements of stories consisting of five sentences, from the dataset created for the story cloze task by Mostafazadeh et al. in 2016 and presents a model that uses character and word ngrams to identify story endings effectively. Moreover it showcases results in the story cloze task concerning distinguishing between correct and incorrect endings when compared to previous research efforts. 
Engaging in a discussion on style analysis is quite interesting. The findings seem to outdo previous efforts on the story cloze task; however this paper does have its flaws that need to be addressed.The first issue lies in the definition of "style." Additionally some restructuring is needed in the paper. For instance the "Results section seems to mix results with experiments which could lead to confusion, among readers.Some detailed questions and comments are provided for clarity.It's currently a bit challenging for readers to differentiate between the data used in each experiment and the data discussed. 
To assess the assertion that a "subtle writing task [...] imposes styles upon the writer " it is crucial to have a deeper understanding of the data provided (lines 729–732). Could you please clarify the number of stories examined and the contributing authors involved in this analysis process ? Additionally could you elaborate further regarding the coherence assessment method mentioned after analyzing the stories – does it entail selecting pairs of narratives authored by the writer where one is classified as "coherent" and the other, as "neutral"? Kindly validate this detail for me. Although your argument could be backed up by "Experiment 1 " I have reservations about the consistency in "Experiment 2." The distinctions drawn between "original versus /wrong”, by the authors raise doubts in my mind regarding the accuracy of lines 370–373. 
Several assertions in the document seem to be unsupported. For instance‚ how were the "five frequent" parts of speech and words chosen – are they truly the common ones in use?" I find the tables a bit perplexin; what's the reason behind having two bars labeled for each category in their legend?" Moreover‚ why opt, for character 4 grams specifically. Were they fine tuned using data from the development set? If these characteristics aren't the most common. Instead were selected from a pool of commonly used parts of speech and words. It's important to explain why they were chosen and how they relate to "style." In what way do these attributes showcase "style"?
The link between the "Design of NLP tasks" part and the remaining content of the document remains unclear. Can be confusing due, to the lack of clarity surrounding the terms "training" and "test" sets mentioned in that section. 
Its challenging to understand the distinction between your model and previous research findings especially when considering lines 217, to 219 that imply a comprehension of text is needed to tackle the task at hand using your suggested method. 
The use of "right" and "wrong" endings mentioned by Mostafazadeh et al. poses a challenge as their meanings are unclear. Does "refer to being logically sound or morally correct? I looked over the instructions provided to the Turkers but couldn't find specific guidelines, for this issue; clarification is necessary. The initial section of the "Story cloze task " specifically lines 159 to 177 is quite challenging to grasp as it currently reads. 
Any other. Thoughts to share?
Table 1 examines the reasons for the variations between the "" coherent and incoherent versions of a story. As per the corpus description provided a Turker was presented with the four sentences of the original narrative and tasked with crafting a satisfactory (or coherent) conclusion as well, as an unsatisfactory (or incoherent) conclusion.The conclusion you presented as "incoherent" doesn’t actually seem all that incoherent  if Kathy prefers expensive $300 shoes it would make sense for her not to enjoy purchasing shoes altogether. This brings up queries regarding the assessment of coherence; How many Turkers assessed coherence and how reliable were their assessments? What standards were utilized to establish coherence? Was it the Turker who assessed both the "correct" and "incorrect" conclusions thus making it a comparative judgment or were these absolute judgments? The difference between the two has consequences, for the ratings. 
"What is the meaning of 'We select 5 original groups in lines 380 to 383?"
Line 398 requires quantifying the statement " all sentences."
"Could you please share the values of the characteristics in Table 5?"
"The term "compared to finishing an assignment" lacks clarity as Turkers are not actually terminating a "task." 
The assertion that "guaranteed every set of conclusions was penned by the writer" pertains to pairs like "correct"/“incorrect " but does not extend to pairs such as "initial"/“fresh " as, per your explanation. 
The mention of " text spans" lacks clarity. What exactly is meant by shorter spans? 
"Can you tell me where this was published?"
