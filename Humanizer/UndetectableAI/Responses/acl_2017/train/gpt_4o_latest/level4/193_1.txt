This paper discusses the use of UCCA as a target representation for parsing and introduces a transition based parser that has shown remarkable success in capturing this representation accurately.. I really enjoyed reading this paper; the discussion on UCCA is particularly interesting and holds significant importance, within our community as it has the potential to spark new ideas regarding how text is represented semantically.. Furthermore I was impressed by the design of the model mentioned in the paper..While the model is based on transition based frameworks as a foundation for its development, in this field of study. The adjustments implemented by the authors were sensible and well explained with an amount of specificity. 
The practical analysis was convincing. The outcomes stood out when contrasted with reputable starting points and the writers showcased the efficiency of the model across various areas.The main drawback I found in this report is the lack of assessment, in languages.This exclusion is quite noticeable considering that the structure being examined is supposed to be fairly universal. "I'm pretty sure there are UCCA datasets out there (, like the "20K Leagues" corpus mentioned in this study) so it would have been interesting to see the outcomes in languages besides English."
Just a small thing to note. In section 6 of the paper I was reading earlier on UCCA analysis methods the writers refer to their model as "grammarless " but that term seems a bit misleading to me personally. Even though UCCA doesn't directly stem from linguistic syntax concepts like we typically think of them in grammar studies it does establish a systematic framework, for creating an abstract symbolic representation of text that follows certain compositional rules.Therefore in my opinion this still counts as a type of grammar. I must say it's a minor point I wanted to mention but it caught my attention enough for me to bring it up here.#This may be just nitpicking on my part but I thought I'd share it anyways.#
Just wanted to mention that I value the authors for their response and input.
