Strengths of this study include addressing the complexity of understanding Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models used to analyze justifications, in values affirmation essays.The research question is quite interesting. Prompts further exploration.The authors suggest applying techniques often used in psychology to tackle this issue.Furthermore the study seeks to confirm beliefs through its discoveries. 
One major flaw in the paper is its objectives. The authors aim to apply psychology methods to understand LSTMs but fail to outline their approach clearly. Alternatively if the main focus is on confirming hypotheses the analysis should explore the connection, between gender indicators and written rationales separately from any model usage. The claim that the study does not provide evidence to support the idea that gender differences are influenced by theories of gender identity remains unproven. 
The discussion in general is interesting. Lacks strong arguments for support. One weak point is the claim that the change in probability of a token in the LSTM network being linked with the SVM coefficients does not necessarily prove that "these probabilities are reliable, for interpreting the model."The SVM coefficients only show part of how the SVM classifier makes decisions. Just because one models coefficient is interpretable doesn't mean it explains another models coefficient. Furthermore the correlation, between coefficients is quite low which undermines the argument being presented. 
As mentioned before there's also a concern about the authors seeming unsure about which of two goals to pursue. It might be better to define and concentrate on one objective. When it comes to the link to psychology which is seen as a vital part of the paper it would help to explain more clearly about the multilevel Bayesian models used to measure assumptions related to gender based self construal. It's hard to assess if the methodology is suitable, without specific information. Given the importance of this aspect, in the papers approach it deserves explanation.
