Strengths;   
The idea of associating document sections, with related topics is groundbreaking and integrating this prior understanding into the LDA framework is a significant enhancement.   
While we may not possess an understanding of the latest developments, in LDA research literature the related work section is well presented and persuasive.   
The suggested approach, for segment sampling with a complexity of O(M) stands out as significant contributing greatly to maintaining efficiency.   
Areas, for improvement;   
Compared to the work done by Balikas in COLING16s study the visual representation in Figure 5 seems engaging. This brings up doubts regarding the precision of document segmentation and topic allocation outcomes. Including an elaborate illustration and ensuring that color assignments align consistently, with the topics outlined in Figure 4 could improve clarity and effectiveness.  
Is the new model adaptable compared to Balikas COLING16s model that it might not fit well with the data provided ? It would be helpful if the authors could provide details, on this potential issue.   
Lets talk about this in general.   
The article is nicely. Well organized with a clear structure in place.The insights shared in the Abstract. Expanded upon in the Introduction are very compelling.The experiments conducted are thorough and solid revealing quantitative results than previous studies.Offer clarity or discuss limitations of the visualization aspect to enhance trust in the findings.There are also worries, about the computational efficiency aspect that need to be addressed. Looking forward to how the authors will tackle the training aspect in future developments after leveraging Variational Inference in their foundational LDA work instead of MCMC.
