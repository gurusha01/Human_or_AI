Pros;   
The research article presents a method based on kernels that successfully detects patterns to distinguish between different categories of rumors by examining the similarities in how they spread through tree like structures. 
Shortcomings;   
Sometimes the math explanations, in Section 4 can be a bit difficult to follow. 
Lets talk about topics.  
The writers introduce a propagation tree kernel as a technique based on kernels to capture patterns in identifying different types of rumors by comparing the similarities in their propagation tree structures.This approach shows more precise rumor identification, than current cutting edge methods. 
The dataset needs to be available to the public, for research reasons. 
The manuscript has some typos that need to be corrected (like on lines 326 and 327 where it should be "has," well as on line 472 where "TPk should be changed to "PTk " and on line 644 where it should read "Table 2 shows"). There are also some details that need to be added (for example on line 875. Where was it published?). The formatting is inconsistent (such, as comparing lines 822 with 897). Moreover Figure 5 seems small. Could be resized for easier reading.
